The homework is longer than I expected. I can't believe it even has reading problem. I couldn't answer the question after I the first time I read the paper. The reading problem took me quite a lot time. Although I haven't been using Java for almost 2 years, I still prefer programming to writing. Except the reading problem, the rest problems are fairly easy. I hope the homework would be shorter next time.
