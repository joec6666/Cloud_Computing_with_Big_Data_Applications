Hw 6 is hard, because there is not much information about how to write sequence files and how to read files from hadoop distributed file system. Even I could run the program and create a sequence file. There is still a problem of choosing file system. Without using FileSystem library, it can only read and write on local file system. I spent a lot of time of finding example code for solving this problem. The rest problems are quite easy, except the last one. Not very sure about what the problem asks.
