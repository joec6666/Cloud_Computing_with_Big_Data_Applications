I am glad we can do some programming instead of writing in homework 3. One thing I am not sure is that if we need to filter out numbers for average word length. Cannot find an exact answer from piazza. The program of problem 1 is quite easy, but there was a tricky part in it. The wrong type of output of mapper, it causeed a problem of running hadoop program. It is not a problem in word count program, since the output of mapreduce and output of mapper are the same. However, the output of mapreduce AvgWordLength is DoubleWritable which is different from the output of mapper. I was stuck for a while.
