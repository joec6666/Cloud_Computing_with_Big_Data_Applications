I am glad homework 4 only has 2 questions. The first question is about Combiner which is quite simple, especially for the programming part. There was only one line of code. The second problem is a little bit troublesome. We have to use distributed cache to store positive words and negative words. I didn't find much code example of how to use distributed cache. I guess one of the reason is that distributed cache has been deprecated.
