I was stuck when I was doing problem one b. I assigned an int type for cost field. This brought me a lot of troubles. The error says that iterator does not match. I tried to google for the answer, but there was none. It took me 2 hours to fix this problem. The rest of homework problems are quite straight forward. Especially the problem 2, it was almost the same as problem 1. One thing I noticed is that although we do not need to complie and run java jar program explicitly, but it is much slower to run a program than running a local program in Eclipse.
