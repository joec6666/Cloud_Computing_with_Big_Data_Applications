I am not sure why every problem in homework 8 asks what dataset(s) is(are) needed for each task, since the name(s) of dataset(s) has(have)already been there in each stub pig script. The pig is much harder to use than what I expect. Not only because runing pig scripts is really slow, even in local job runner mode, it's also not flexible. For instance, I cannot filter out customers with orders less than 5 while I am doing the counting. At least I don't know how to do it. It is also really hard to debug the program since I cannot set break points
