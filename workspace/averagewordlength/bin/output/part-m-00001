	ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO]	999
	999
PHILO	Nay, but this dotage of our general's	999
	O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,	999
	That o'er the files and musters of the war	999
	Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,	999
	The office and devotion of their view	999
	Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,	999
	Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst	999
	The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,	999
	And is become the bellows and the fan	999
	To cool a gipsy's lust.	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies,	999
	the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her]	999
	999
		  Look, where they come:	999
	Take but good note, and you shall see in him.	999
	The triple pillar of the world transform'd	999
	Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	If it be love indeed, tell me how much.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.	999
	999
	[Enter an Attendant]	999
	999
Attendant	News, my good lord, from Rome.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Grates me: the sum.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Nay, hear them, Antony:	999
	Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows	999
	If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent	999
	His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;	999
	Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;	999
	Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	How, my love!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Perchance! nay, and most like:	999
	You must not stay here longer, your dismission	999
	Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.	999
	Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?	999
	Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,	999
	Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine	999
	Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame	999
	When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch	999
	Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.	999
	Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike	999
	Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life	999
	Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair	999
	999
	[Embracing]	999
	999
	And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,	999
	On pain of punishment, the world to weet	999
	We stand up peerless.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Excellent falsehood!	999
	Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?	999
	I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony	999
	Will be himself.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	                  But stirr'd by Cleopatra.	999
	Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,	999
	Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:	999
	There's not a minute of our lives should stretch	999
	Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Hear the ambassadors.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Fie, wrangling queen!	999
	Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,	999
	To weep; whose every passion fully strives	999
	To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!	999
	No messenger, but thine; and all alone	999
	To-night we'll wander through the streets and note	999
	The qualities of people. Come, my queen;	999
	Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.	999
	999
	[Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with	999
	their train]	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?	999
	999
PHILO	Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,	999
	He comes too short of that great property	999
	Which still should go with Antony.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	I am full sorry	999
	That he approves the common liar, who	999
	Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope	999
	Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!	999

SCENE II	The same. Another room.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer]	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,	999
	almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer	999
	that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew	999
	this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns	999
	with garlands!	999
	999
ALEXAS	Soothsayer!	999
	999
Soothsayer	Your will?	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?	999
	999
Soothsayer	In nature's infinite book of secrecy	999
	A little I can read.	999
	999
ALEXAS	Show him your hand.	999
	999
	[Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough	999
	Cleopatra's health to drink.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Good sir, give me good fortune.	999
	999
Soothsayer	I make not, but foresee.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Pray, then, foresee me one.	999
	999
Soothsayer	You shall be yet far fairer than you are.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	He means in flesh.	999
	999
IRAS	No, you shall paint when you are old.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Wrinkles forbid!	999
	999
ALEXAS	Vex not his prescience; be attentive.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Hush!	999
	999
Soothsayer	You shall be more beloving than beloved.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	I had rather heat my liver with drinking.	999
	999
ALEXAS	Nay, hear him.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married	999
	to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:	999
	let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry	999
	may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius	999
	Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.	999
	999
Soothsayer	You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	O excellent! I love long life better than figs.	999
	999
Soothsayer	You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune	999
	Than that which is to approach.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Then belike my children shall have no names:	999
	prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?	999
	999
Soothsayer	If every of your wishes had a womb.	999
	And fertile every wish, a million.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.	999
	999
ALEXAS	You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Nay, come, tell Iras hers.	999
	999
ALEXAS	We'll know all our fortunes.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall	999
	be--drunk to bed.	999
	999
IRAS	There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.	999
	999
IRAS	Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful	999
	prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,	999
	tell her but a worky-day fortune.	999
	999
Soothsayer	Your fortunes are alike.	999
	999
IRAS	But how, but how? give me particulars.	999
	999
Soothsayer	I have said.	999
	999
IRAS	Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than	999
	I, where would you choose it?	999
	999
IRAS	Not in my husband's nose.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,	999
	his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman	999
	that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let	999
	her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst	999
	follow worse, till the worst of all follow him	999
	laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good	999
	Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a	999
	matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!	999
	999
IRAS	Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!	999
	for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man	999
	loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a	999
	foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep	999
	decorum, and fortune him accordingly!	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Amen.	999
	999
ALEXAS	Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a	999
	cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but	999
	they'ld do't!	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Hush! here comes Antony.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Not he; the queen.	999
	999
	[Enter CLEOPATRA]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Saw you my lord?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	                  No, lady.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Was he not here?	999
	999
CHARMIAN	No, madam.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden	999
	A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Madam?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Seek him, and bring him hither.	999
	Where's Alexas?	999
	999
ALEXAS	Here, at your service. My lord approaches.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	We will not look upon him: go with us.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants]	999
	999
Messenger	Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Against my brother Lucius?	999
	999
Messenger	Ay:	999
	But soon that war had end, and the time's state	999
	Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;	999
	Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,	999
	Upon the first encounter, drave them.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Well, what worst?	999
	999
Messenger	The nature of bad news infects the teller.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	When it concerns the fool or coward. On:	999
	Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:	999
	Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,	999
	I hear him as he flatter'd.	999
	999
Messenger	Labienus--	999
	This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,	999
	Extended Asia from Euphrates;	999
	His conquering banner shook from Syria	999
	To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Antony, thou wouldst say,--	999
	999
Messenger	O, my lord!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:	999
	Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;	999
	Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults	999
	With such full licence as both truth and malice	999
	Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,	999
	When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us	999
	Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.	999
	999
Messenger	At your noble pleasure.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!	999
	999
First Attendant	The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?	999
	999
Second Attendant	He stays upon your will.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Let him appear.	999
	These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,	999
	Or lose myself in dotage.	999
	999
	[Enter another Messenger]	999
	999
		    What are you?	999
	999
Second Messenger	Fulvia thy wife is dead.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Where died she?	999
	999
Second Messenger	In Sicyon:	999
	Her length of sickness, with what else more serious	999
	Importeth thee to know, this bears.	999
	999
	[Gives a letter]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Forbear me.	999
	999
	[Exit Second Messenger]	999
	999
	There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:	999
	What our contempt doth often hurl from us,	999
	We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,	999
	By revolution lowering, does become	999
	The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;	999
	The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.	999
	I must from this enchanting queen break off:	999
	Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,	999
	My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!	999
	999
	[Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	What's your pleasure, sir?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I must with haste from hence.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Why, then, we kill all our women:	999
	we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;	999
	if they suffer our departure, death's the word.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I must be gone.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were	999
	pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between	999
	them and a great cause, they should be esteemed	999
	nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of	999
	this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty	999
	times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is	999
	mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon	999
	her, she hath such a celerity in dying.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	She is cunning past man's thought.	999
	999
	[Exit ALEXAS]	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but	999
	the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her	999
	winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater	999
	storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this	999
	cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a	999
	shower of rain as well as Jove.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Would I had never seen her.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece	999
	of work; which not to have been blest withal would	999
	have discredited your travel.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Fulvia is dead.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Sir?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Fulvia is dead.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Fulvia!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Dead.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When	999
	it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man	999
	from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;	999
	comforting therein, that when old robes are worn	999
	out, there are members to make new. If there were	999
	no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,	999
	and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned	999
	with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new	999
	petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion	999
	that should water this sorrow.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	The business she hath broached in the state	999
	Cannot endure my absence.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	And the business you have broached here cannot be	999
	without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which	999
	wholly depends on your abode.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	No more light answers. Let our officers	999
	Have notice what we purpose. I shall break	999
	The cause of our expedience to the queen,	999
	And get her leave to part. For not alone	999
	The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,	999
	Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too	999
	Of many our contriving friends in Rome	999
	Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius	999
	Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands	999
	The empire of the sea: our slippery people,	999
	Whose love is never link'd to the deserver	999
	Till his deserts are past, begin to throw	999
	Pompey the Great and all his dignities	999
	Upon his son; who, high in name and power,	999
	Higher than both in blood and life, stands up	999
	For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,	999
	The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,	999
	Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,	999
	And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,	999
	To such whose place is under us, requires	999
	Our quick remove from hence.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I shall do't.	999

	999
CLEOPATRA	Where is he?	999
	999
CHARMIAN	                  I did not see him since.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	See where he is, who's with him, what he does:	999
	I did not send you: if you find him sad,	999
	Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report	999
	That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.	999
	999
	[Exit ALEXAS]	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,	999
	You do not hold the method to enforce	999
	The like from him.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	                  What should I do, I do not?	999
	999
CHARMIAN	In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:	999
	In time we hate that which we often fear.	999
	But here comes Antony.	999
	999
	[Enter MARK ANTONY]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I am sick and sullen.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:	999
	It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature	999
	Will not sustain it.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Now, my dearest queen,--	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Pray you, stand further from me.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	What's the matter?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.	999
	What says the married woman? You may go:	999
	Would she had never given you leave to come!	999
	Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:	999
	I have no power upon you; hers you are.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	The gods best know,--	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	O, never was there queen	999
	So mightily betray'd! yet at the first	999
	I saw the treasons planted.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Cleopatra,--	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Why should I think you can be mine and true,	999
	Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,	999
	Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,	999
	To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,	999
	Which break themselves in swearing!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Most sweet queen,--	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,	999
	But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,	999
	Then was the time for words: no going then;	999
	Eternity was in our lips and eyes,	999
	Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,	999
	But was a race of heaven: they are so still,	999
	Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,	999
	Art turn'd the greatest liar.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	How now, lady!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know	999
	There were a heart in Egypt.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Hear me, queen:	999
	The strong necessity of time commands	999
	Our services awhile; but my full heart	999
	Remains in use with you. Our Italy	999
	Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius	999
	Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:	999
	Equality of two domestic powers	999
	Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,	999
	Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,	999
	Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,	999
	Into the hearts of such as have not thrived	999
	Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;	999
	And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge	999
	By any desperate change: my more particular,	999
	And that which most with you should safe my going,	999
	Is Fulvia's death.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Though age from folly could not give me freedom,	999
	It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	She's dead, my queen:	999
	Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read	999
	The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:	999
	See when and where she died.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	O most false love!	999
	Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill	999
	With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,	999
	In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know	999
	The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,	999
	As you shall give the advice. By the fire	999
	That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence	999
	Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war	999
	As thou affect'st.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	                  Cut my lace, Charmian, come;	999
	But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,	999
	So Antony loves.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	                  My precious queen, forbear;	999
	And give true evidence to his love, which stands	999
	An honourable trial.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	So Fulvia told me.	999
	I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,	999
	Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears	999
	Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene	999
	Of excellent dissembling; and let it look	999
	Life perfect honour.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	You'll heat my blood: no more.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	You can do better yet; but this is meetly.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Now, by my sword,--	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	And target. Still he mends;	999
	But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,	999
	How this Herculean Roman does become	999
	The carriage of his chafe.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I'll leave you, lady.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Courteous lord, one word.	999
	Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:	999
	Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;	999
	That you know well: something it is I would,	999
	O, my oblivion is a very Antony,	999
	And I am all forgotten.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	But that your royalty	999
	Holds idleness your subject, I should take you	999
	For idleness itself.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	'Tis sweating labour	999
	To bear such idleness so near the heart	999
	As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;	999
	Since my becomings kill me, when they do not	999
	Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;	999
	Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.	999
	And all the gods go with you! upon your sword	999
	Sit laurel victory! and smooth success	999
	Be strew'd before your feet!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Let us go. Come;	999
	Our separation so abides, and flies,	999
	That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,	999
	And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!	999

SCENE IV	Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS,	999
	and their Train]	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,	999
	It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate	999
	Our great competitor: from Alexandria	999
	This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes	999
	The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like	999
	Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy	999
	More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or	999
	Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there	999
	A man who is the abstract of all faults	999
	That all men follow.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	I must not think there are	999
	Evils enow to darken all his goodness:	999
	His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,	999
	More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,	999
	Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,	999
	Than what he chooses.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not	999
	Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;	999
	To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit	999
	And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;	999
	To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet	999
	With knaves that smell of sweat: say this	999
	becomes him,--	999
	As his composure must be rare indeed	999
	Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony	999
	No way excuse his soils, when we do bear	999
	So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd	999
	His vacancy with his voluptuousness,	999
	Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,	999
	Call on him for't: but to confound such time,	999
	That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud	999
	As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid	999
	As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,	999
	Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,	999
	And so rebel to judgment.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Here's more news.	999
	999
Messenger	Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,	999
	Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report	999
	How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;	999
	And it appears he is beloved of those	999
	That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports	999
	The discontents repair, and men's reports	999
	Give him much wrong'd.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	I should have known no less.	999
	It hath been taught us from the primal state,	999
	That he which is was wish'd until he were;	999
	And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,	999
	Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,	999
	Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,	999
	Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,	999
	To rot itself with motion.	999
	999
Messenger	Caesar, I bring thee word,	999
	Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,	999
	Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound	999
	With keels of every kind: many hot inroads	999
	They make in Italy; the borders maritime	999
	Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:	999
	No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon	999
	Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more	999
	Than could his war resisted.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Antony,	999
	Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once	999
	Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st	999
	Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel	999
	Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,	999
	Though daintily brought up, with patience more	999
	Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink	999
	The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle	999
	Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign	999
	The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;	999
	Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,	999
	The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps	999
	It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,	999
	Which some did die to look on: and all this--	999
	It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--	999
	Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek	999
	So much as lank'd not.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	'Tis pity of him.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Let his shames quickly	999
	Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain	999
	Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end	999
	Assemble we immediate council: Pompey	999
	Thrives in our idleness.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	To-morrow, Caesar,	999
	I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly	999
	Both what by sea and land I can be able	999
	To front this present time.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Till which encounter,	999
	It is my business too. Farewell.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime	999
	Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,	999
	To let me be partaker.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Doubt not, sir;	999
	I knew it for my bond.	999

SCENE V	Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Charmian!	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Madam?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Ha, ha!	999
	Give me to drink mandragora.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Why, madam?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	That I might sleep out this great gap of time	999
	My Antony is away.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	                  You think of him too much.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	O, 'tis treason!	999
	999
CHARMIAN	                  Madam, I trust, not so.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Thou, eunuch Mardian!	999
	999
MARDIAN	What's your highness' pleasure?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure	999
	In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,	999
	That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts	999
	May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?	999
	999
MARDIAN	Yes, gracious madam.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Indeed!	999
	999
MARDIAN	Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing	999
	But what indeed is honest to be done:	999
	Yet have I fierce affections, and think	999
	What Venus did with Mars.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	O Charmian,	999
	Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?	999
	Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?	999
	O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!	999
	Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?	999
	The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm	999
	And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,	999
	Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'	999
	For so he calls me: now I feed myself	999
	With most delicious poison. Think on me,	999
	That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,	999
	And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,	999
	When thou wast here above the ground, I was	999
	A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey	999
	Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;	999
	There would he anchor his aspect and die	999
	With looking on his life.	999
	999
	[Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR]	999
	999
ALEXAS	Sovereign of Egypt, hail!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!	999
	Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath	999
	With his tinct gilded thee.	999
	How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?	999
	999
ALEXAS	Last thing he did, dear queen,	999
	He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--	999
	This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Mine ear must pluck it thence.	999
	999
ALEXAS	'Good friend,' quoth he,	999
	'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends	999
	This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,	999
	To mend the petty present, I will piece	999
	Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,	999
	Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,	999
	And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,	999
	Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke	999
	Was beastly dumb'd by him.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	What, was he sad or merry?	999
	999
ALEXAS	Like to the time o' the year between the extremes	999
	Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	O well-divided disposition! Note him,	999
	Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:	999
	He was not sad, for he would shine on those	999
	That make their looks by his; he was not merry,	999
	Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay	999
	In Egypt with his joy; but between both:	999
	O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,	999
	The violence of either thee becomes,	999
	So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?	999
	999
ALEXAS	Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:	999
	Why do you send so thick?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Who's born that day	999
	When I forget to send to Antony,	999
	Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.	999
	Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,	999
	Ever love Caesar so?	999
	999
CHARMIAN	O that brave Caesar!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Be choked with such another emphasis!	999
	Say, the brave Antony.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	The valiant Caesar!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,	999
	If thou with Caesar paragon again	999
	My man of men.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	                  By your most gracious pardon,	999
	I sing but after you.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	My salad days,	999
	When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,	999
	To say as I said then! But, come, away;	999
	Get me ink and paper:	999
	He shall have every day a several greeting,	999
	Or I'll unpeople Egypt.	999

	999
	[Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in	999
	warlike manner]	999
	999
POMPEY	If the great gods be just, they shall assist	999
	The deeds of justest men.	999
	999
MENECRATES	Know, worthy Pompey,	999
	That what they do delay, they not deny.	999
	999
POMPEY	Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays	999
	The thing we sue for.	999
	999
MENECRATES	We, ignorant of ourselves,	999
	Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers	999
	Deny us for our good; so find we profit	999
	By losing of our prayers.	999
	999
POMPEY	I shall do well:	999
	The people love me, and the sea is mine;	999
	My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope	999
	Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony	999
	In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make	999
	No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where	999
	He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,	999
	Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,	999
	Nor either cares for him.	999
	999
MENAS	Caesar and Lepidus	999
	Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.	999
	999
POMPEY	Where have you this? 'tis false.	999
	999
MENAS	From Silvius, sir.	999
	999
POMPEY	He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,	999
	Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,	999
	Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!	999
	Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!	999
	Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,	999
	Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks	999
	Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;	999
	That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour	999
	Even till a Lethe'd dulness!	999
	999
	[Enter VARRIUS]	999
	999
		       How now, Varrius!	999
	999
VARRIUS	This is most certain that I shall deliver:	999
	Mark Antony is every hour in Rome	999
	Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis	999
	A space for further travel.	999
	999
POMPEY	I could have given less matter	999
	A better ear. Menas, I did not think	999
	This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm	999
	For such a petty war: his soldiership	999
	Is twice the other twain: but let us rear	999
	The higher our opinion, that our stirring	999
	Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck	999
	The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.	999
	999
MENAS	I cannot hope	999
	Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:	999
	His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;	999
	His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,	999
	Not moved by Antony.	999
	999
POMPEY	I know not, Menas,	999
	How lesser enmities may give way to greater.	999
	Were't not that we stand up against them all,	999
	'Twere pregnant they should square between	999
	themselves;	999
	For they have entertained cause enough	999
	To draw their swords: but how the fear of us	999
	May cement their divisions and bind up	999
	The petty difference, we yet not know.	999
	Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands	999
	Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.	999
	Come, Menas.	999

	[Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS]	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,	999
	And shall become you well, to entreat your captain	999
	To soft and gentle speech.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I shall entreat him	999
	To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,	999
	Let Antony look over Caesar's head	999
	And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,	999
	Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,	999
	I would not shave't to-day.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	'Tis not a time	999
	For private stomaching.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Every time	999
	Serves for the matter that is then born in't.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	But small to greater matters must give way.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Not if the small come first.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Your speech is passion:	999
	But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes	999
	The noble Antony.	999
	999
	[Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS]	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	                  And yonder, Caesar.	999
	999
	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	If we compose well here, to Parthia:	999
	Hark, Ventidius.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  I do not know,	999
	Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Noble friends,	999
	That which combined us was most great, and let not	999
	A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,	999
	May it be gently heard: when we debate	999
	Our trivial difference loud, we do commit	999
	Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,	999
	The rather, for I earnestly beseech,	999
	Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,	999
	Nor curstness grow to the matter.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	'Tis spoken well.	999
	Were we before our armies, and to fight.	999
	I should do thus.	999
	999
	[Flourish]	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Welcome to Rome.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	                  Thank you.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Sit.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Sit, sir.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Nay, then.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I learn, you take things ill which are not so,	999
	Or being, concern you not.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	I must be laugh'd at,	999
	If, or for nothing or a little, I	999
	Should say myself offended, and with you	999
	Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should	999
	Once name you derogately, when to sound your name	999
	It not concern'd me.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	My being in Egypt, Caesar,	999
	What was't to you?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	No more than my residing here at Rome	999
	Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there	999
	Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt	999
	Might be my question.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	How intend you, practised?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You may be pleased to catch at mine intent	999
	By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother	999
	Made wars upon me; and their contestation	999
	Was theme for you, you were the word of war.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	You do mistake your business; my brother never	999
	Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;	999
	And have my learning from some true reports,	999
	That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather	999
	Discredit my authority with yours;	999
	And make the wars alike against my stomach,	999
	Having alike your cause? Of this my letters	999
	Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,	999
	As matter whole you have not to make it with,	999
	It must not be with this.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You praise yourself	999
	By laying defects of judgment to me; but	999
	You patch'd up your excuses.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Not so, not so;	999
	I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,	999
	Very necessity of this thought, that I,	999
	Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,	999
	Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars	999
	Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,	999
	I would you had her spirit in such another:	999
	The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle	999
	You may pace easy, but not such a wife.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Would we had all such wives, that the men might go	999
	to wars with the women!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar	999
	Made out of her impatience, which not wanted	999
	Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant	999
	Did you too much disquiet: for that you must	999
	But say, I could not help it.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	I wrote to you	999
	When rioting in Alexandria; you	999
	Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts	999
	Did gibe my missive out of audience.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Sir,	999
	He fell upon me ere admitted: then	999
	Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want	999
	Of what I was i' the morning: but next day	999
	I told him of myself; which was as much	999
	As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow	999
	Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,	999
	Out of our question wipe him.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You have broken	999
	The article of your oath; which you shall never	999
	Have tongue to charge me with.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Soft, Caesar!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	No,	999
	Lepidus, let him speak:	999
	The honour is sacred which he talks on now,	999
	Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;	999
	The article of my oath.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	To lend me arms and aid when I required them;	999
	The which you both denied.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Neglected, rather;	999
	And then when poison'd hours had bound me up	999
	From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,	999
	I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty	999
	Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power	999
	Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,	999
	To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;	999
	For which myself, the ignorant motive, do	999
	So far ask pardon as befits mine honour	999
	To stoop in such a case.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	'Tis noble spoken.	999
	999
MECAENAS	If it might please you, to enforce no further	999
	The griefs between ye: to forget them quite	999
	Were to remember that the present need	999
	Speaks to atone you.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Or, if you borrow one another's love for the	999
	instant, you may, when you hear no more words of	999
	Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to	999
	wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Go to, then; your considerate stone.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	I do not much dislike the matter, but	999
	The manner of his speech; for't cannot be	999
	We shall remain in friendship, our conditions	999
	So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew	999
	What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge	999
	O' the world I would pursue it.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	Give me leave, Caesar,--	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Speak, Agrippa.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,	999
	Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony	999
	Is now a widower.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  Say not so, Agrippa:	999
	If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof	999
	Were well deserved of rashness.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I am not married, Caesar: let me hear	999
	Agrippa further speak.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	To hold you in perpetual amity,	999
	To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts	999
	With an unslipping knot, take Antony	999
	Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims	999
	No worse a husband than the best of men;	999
	Whose virtue and whose general graces speak	999
	That which none else can utter. By this marriage,	999
	All little jealousies, which now seem great,	999
	And all great fears, which now import their dangers,	999
	Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,	999
	Where now half tales be truths: her love to both	999
	Would, each to other and all loves to both,	999
	Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;	999
	For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,	999
	By duty ruminated.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	                  Will Caesar speak?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd	999
	With what is spoke already.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	What power is in Agrippa,	999
	If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'	999
	To make this good?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  The power of Caesar, and	999
	His power unto Octavia.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	May I never	999
	To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,	999
	Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:	999
	Further this act of grace: and from this hour	999
	The heart of brothers govern in our loves	999
	And sway our great designs!	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	There is my hand.	999
	A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother	999
	Did ever love so dearly: let her live	999
	To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never	999
	Fly off our loves again!	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Happily, amen!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;	999
	For he hath laid strange courtesies and great	999
	Of late upon me: I must thank him only,	999
	Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;	999
	At heel of that, defy him.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Time calls upon's:	999
	Of us must Pompey presently be sought,	999
	Or else he seeks out us.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Where lies he?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	About the mount Misenum.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	What is his strength by land?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Great and increasing: but by sea	999
	He is an absolute master.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	So is the fame.	999
	Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:	999
	Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we	999
	The business we have talk'd of.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	With most gladness:	999
	And do invite you to my sister's view,	999
	Whither straight I'll lead you.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Let us, Lepidus,	999
	Not lack your company.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Noble Antony,	999
	Not sickness should detain me.	999
	999
	[Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY,	999
	and LEPIDUS]	999
	999
MECAENAS	Welcome from Egypt, sir.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My	999
	honourable friend, Agrippa!	999
	999
AGRIPPA	Good Enobarbus!	999
	999
MECAENAS	We have cause to be glad that matters are so well	999
	digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and	999
	made the night light with drinking.	999
	999
MECAENAS	Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and	999
	but twelve persons there; is this true?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more	999
	monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.	999
	999
MECAENAS	She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to	999
	her.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up	999
	his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised	999
	well for her.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I will tell you.	999
	The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,	999
	Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;	999
	Purple the sails, and so perfumed that	999
	The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,	999
	Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made	999
	The water which they beat to follow faster,	999
	As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,	999
	It beggar'd all description: she did lie	999
	In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--	999
	O'er-picturing that Venus where we see	999
	The fancy outwork nature: on each side her	999
	Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,	999
	With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem	999
	To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,	999
	And what they undid did.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	O, rare for Antony!	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,	999
	So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,	999
	And made their bends adornings: at the helm	999
	A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle	999
	Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,	999
	That yarely frame the office. From the barge	999
	A strange invisible perfume hits the sense	999
	Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast	999
	Her people out upon her; and Antony,	999
	Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,	999
	Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,	999
	Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,	999
	And made a gap in nature.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	Rare Egyptian!	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,	999
	Invited her to supper: she replied,	999
	It should be better he became her guest;	999
	Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,	999
	Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,	999
	Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,	999
	And for his ordinary pays his heart	999
	For what his eyes eat only.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	Royal wench!	999
	She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:	999
	He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I saw her once	999
	Hop forty paces through the public street;	999
	And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,	999
	That she did make defect perfection,	999
	And, breathless, power breathe forth.	999
	999
MECAENAS	Now Antony must leave her utterly.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Never; he will not:	999
	Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale	999
	Her infinite variety: other women cloy	999
	The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry	999
	Where most she satisfies; for vilest things	999
	Become themselves in her: that the holy priests	999
	Bless her when she is riggish.	999
	999
MECAENAS	If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle	999
	The heart of Antony, Octavia is	999
	A blessed lottery to him.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	Let us go.	999
	Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest	999
	Whilst you abide here.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Humbly, sir, I thank you.	999

	[Enter MARK ANTONY, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, OCTAVIA between	999
	them, and Attendants]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	The world and my great office will sometimes	999
	Divide me from your bosom.	999
	999
OCTAVIA	All which time	999
	Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers	999
	To them for you.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	                  Good night, sir. My Octavia,	999
	Read not my blemishes in the world's report:	999
	I have not kept my square; but that to come	999
	Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.	999
	Good night, sir.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Good night.	999
	999
	[Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA]	999
	999
	[Enter Soothsayer]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?	999
	999
Soothsayer	Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	If you can, your reason?	999
	999
Soothsayer	I see it in	999
	My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet	999
	Hie you to Egypt again.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Say to me,	999
	Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?	999
	999
Soothsayer	Caesar's.	999
	Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:	999
	Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is	999
	Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,	999
	Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel	999
	Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore	999
	Make space enough between you.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Speak this no more.	999
	999
Soothsayer	To none but thee; no more, but when to thee.	999
	If thou dost play with him at any game,	999
	Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck,	999
	He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,	999
	When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit	999
	Is all afraid to govern thee near him;	999
	But, he away, 'tis noble.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Get thee gone:	999
	Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:	999
	999
	[Exit Soothsayer]	999
	999
	He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,	999
	He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;	999
	And in our sports my better cunning faints	999
	Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;	999
	His cocks do win the battle still of mine,	999
	When it is all to nought; and his quails ever	999
	Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:	999
	And though I make this marriage for my peace,	999
	I' the east my pleasure lies.	999
	999
	[Enter VENTIDIUS]	999
	999
		        O, come, Ventidius,	999

	Which will become you both, farewell.	999
	999
MECAENAS	We shall,	999
	As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount	999
	Before you, Lepidus.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Your way is shorter;	999

	999
	999
	[Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Give me some music; music, moody food	999

Attendants	The music, ho!	999
	999
	[Enter MARDIAN]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	As well a woman with an eunuch play'd	999
	As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?	999
	999
MARDIAN	As well as I can, madam.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	And when good will is show'd, though't come	999
	too short,	999
	The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:	999
	Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,	999
	My music playing far off, I will betray	999
	Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce	999
	Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,	999
	I'll think them every one an Antony,	999
	And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'	999
	999
CHARMIAN	'Twas merry when	999
	You wager'd on your angling; when your diver	999
	Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he	999
	With fervency drew up.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	That time,--O times!--	999
	I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night	999
	I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,	999
	Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;	999
	Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst	999
	I wore his sword Philippan.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999

		      O, from Italy	999

Messenger	Madam, madam,--	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain,	999
	Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,	999
	If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here	999
	My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings	999
	Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.	999
	999
Messenger	First, madam, he is well.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Why, there's more gold.	999
	But, sirrah, mark, we use	999
	To say the dead are well: bring it to that,	999
	The gold I give thee will I melt and pour	999
	Down thy ill-uttering throat.	999
	999
Messenger	Good madam, hear me.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Well, go to, I will;	999
	But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony	999
	Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour	999
	To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,	999
	Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,	999
	Not like a formal man.	999
	999
Messenger	Will't please you hear me?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:	999
	Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,	999
	Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,	999
	I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail	999
	Rich pearls upon thee.	999
	999
Messenger	Madam, he's well.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Well said.	999
	999
Messenger	And friends with Caesar.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Thou'rt an honest man.	999
	999
Messenger	Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Make thee a fortune from me.	999
	999
Messenger	But yet, madam,--	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay	999
	The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!	999
	'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth	999
	Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,	999
	Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,	999
	The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:	999
	In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.	999
	999
Messenger	Free, madam! no; I made no such report:	999
	He's bound unto Octavia.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	For what good turn?	999
	999
Messenger	For the best turn i' the bed.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I am pale, Charmian.	999
	999
Messenger	Madam, he's married to Octavia.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	The most infectious pestilence upon thee!	999
	999
	[Strikes him down]	999
	999
Messenger	Good madam, patience.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	What say you? Hence,	999
	999
	[Strikes him again]	999
	999
	Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes	999
	Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:	999
	999
	[She hales him up and down]	999
	999
	Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,	999
	Smarting in lingering pickle.	999
	999
Messenger	Gracious madam,	999
	I that do bring the news made not the match.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,	999
	And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst	999
	Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;	999
	And I will boot thee with what gift beside	999
	Thy modesty can beg.	999
	999
Messenger	He's married, madam.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Rogue, thou hast lived too long.	999
	999
	[Draws a knife]	999
	999
Messenger	Nay, then I'll run.	999
	What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:	999
	The man is innocent.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.	999
	Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures	999
	Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:	999
	Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	He is afeard to come.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I will not hurt him.	999
	999
	[Exit CHARMIAN]	999
	999
	These hands do lack nobility, that they strike	999
	A meaner than myself; since I myself	999
	Have given myself the cause.	999
	999
	[Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger]	999
	999
		       Come hither, sir.	999
	Though it be honest, it is never good	999
	To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.	999
	An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell	999
	Themselves when they be felt.	999
	999
Messenger	I have done my duty.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Is he married?	999
	I cannot hate thee worser than I do,	999
	If thou again say 'Yes.'	999
	999
Messenger	He's married, madam.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?	999
	999
Messenger	Should I lie, madam?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	O, I would thou didst,	999
	So half my Egypt were submerged and made	999
	A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:	999
	Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me	999
	Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?	999
	999
Messenger	I crave your highness' pardon.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	He is married?	999
	999
Messenger	Take no offence that I would not offend you:	999
	To punish me for what you make me do.	999
	Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,	999
	That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:	999
	The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome	999
	Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,	999
	And be undone by 'em!	999
	999
	[Exit Messenger]	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Good your highness, patience.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Many times, madam.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	                  I am paid for't now.	999
	Lead me from hence:	999
	I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.	999
	Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him	999
	Report the feature of Octavia, her years,	999
	Her inclination, let him not leave out	999
	The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.	999
	999
	[Exit ALEXAS]	999
	999
	Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,	999
	Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,	999
	The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas	999
	999
	[To MARDIAN]	999
	999
	Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,	999
	But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE VI	Near Misenum.	999
	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door,	999
	with drum and trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR,	999
	MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS,	999
	with Soldiers marching]	999
	999
POMPEY	Your hostages I have, so have you mine;	999
	And we shall talk before we fight.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Most meet	999
	That first we come to words; and therefore have we	999
	Our written purposes before us sent;	999
	Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know	999
	If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,	999
	And carry back to Sicily much tall youth	999
	That else must perish here.	999
	999
POMPEY	To you all three,	999
	The senators alone of this great world,	999
	Chief factors for the gods, I do not know	999
	Wherefore my father should revengers want,	999
	Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,	999
	Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,	999
	There saw you labouring for him. What was't	999
	That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what	999
	Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,	999
	With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,	999
	To drench the Capitol; but that they would	999
	Have one man but a man? And that is it	999
	Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen	999
	The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant	999
	To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome	999
	Cast on my noble father.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Take your time.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;	999
	We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st	999
	How much we do o'er-count thee.	999
	999
POMPEY	At land, indeed,	999
	Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:	999
	But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,	999
	Remain in't as thou mayst.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Be pleased to tell us--	999
	For this is from the present--how you take	999
	The offers we have sent you.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	There's the point.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Which do not be entreated to, but weigh	999
	What it is worth embraced.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	And what may follow,	999
	To try a larger fortune.	999
	999
POMPEY	You have made me offer	999
	Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must	999
	Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send	999
	Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon	999
	To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back	999
	Our targes undinted.	999
	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	|	999
	|	999
MARK ANTONY	|  That's our offer.	999
	|	999
LEPIDUS	|	999
	999
	999
POMPEY	Know, then,	999
	I came before you here a man prepared	999
	To take this offer: but Mark Antony	999
	Put me to some impatience: though I lose	999
	The praise of it by telling, you must know,	999
	When Caesar and your brother were at blows,	999
	Your mother came to Sicily and did find	999
	Her welcome friendly.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I have heard it, Pompey;	999
	And am well studied for a liberal thanks	999
	Which I do owe you.	999
	999
POMPEY	Let me have your hand:	999
	I did not think, sir, to have met you here.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,	999
	That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;	999
	For I have gain'd by 't.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Since I saw you last,	999
	There is a change upon you.	999
	999
POMPEY	Well, I know not	999
	What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;	999
	But in my bosom shall she never come,	999
	To make my heart her vassal.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Well met here.	999
	999
POMPEY	I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:	999
	I crave our composition may be written,	999
	And seal'd between us.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	That's the next to do.	999
	999
POMPEY	We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's	999
	Draw lots who shall begin.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	That will I, Pompey.	999
	999
POMPEY	No, Antony, take the lot: but, first	999
	Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery	999
	Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar	999
	Grew fat with feasting there.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	You have heard much.	999
	999
POMPEY	I have fair meanings, sir.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	And fair words to them.	999
	999
POMPEY	Then so much have I heard:	999
	And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	No more of that: he did so.	999
	999
POMPEY	What, I pray you?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.	999
	999
POMPEY	I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Well;	999
	And well am like to do; for, I perceive,	999
	Four feasts are toward.	999
	999
POMPEY	Let me shake thy hand;	999
	I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,	999
	When I have envied thy behavior.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Sir,	999
	I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,	999
	When you have well deserved ten times as much	999
	As I have said you did.	999
	999
POMPEY	Enjoy thy plainness,	999
	It nothing ill becomes thee.	999
	Aboard my galley I invite you all:	999
	Will you lead, lords?	999
	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	|	999
	|	999
MARK ANTONY	|  Show us the way, sir.	999
	|	999
LEPIDUS	|	999
	999
	999
POMPEY	Come.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS]	999
	999
MENAS	[Aside]  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have	999
	made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	At sea, I think.	999
	999
MENAS	We have, sir.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	You have done well by water.	999
	999
MENAS	And you by land.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I will praise any man that will praise me; though it	999
	cannot be denied what I have done by land.	999
	999
MENAS	Nor what I have done by water.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Yes, something you can deny for your own	999
	safety: you have been a great thief by sea.	999
	999
MENAS	And you by land.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	There I deny my land service. But give me your	999
	hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they	999
	might take two thieves kissing.	999
	999
MENAS	All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	But there is never a fair woman has a true face.	999
	999
MENAS	No slander; they steal hearts.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	We came hither to fight with you.	999
	999
MENAS	For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.	999
	Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.	999
	999
MENAS	You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony	999
	here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Caesar's sister is called Octavia.	999
	999
MENAS	True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.	999
	999
MENAS	Pray ye, sir?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	'Tis true.	999
	999
MENAS	Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would	999
	not prophesy so.	999
	999
MENAS	I think the policy of that purpose made more in the	999
	marriage than the love of the parties.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I think so too. But you shall find, the band that	999
	seems to tie their friendship together will be the	999
	very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a	999
	holy, cold, and still conversation.	999
	999
MENAS	Who would not have his wife so?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.	999
	He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the	999
	sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as	999
	I said before, that which is the strength of their	999
	amity shall prove the immediate author of their	999
	variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:	999
	he married but his occasion here.	999
	999
MENAS	And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?	999
	I have a health for you.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.	999
	999
MENAS	Come, let's away.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
SCENE VII	On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum.	999
	999
	999
	[Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with	999
	a banquet]	999
	999
First Servant	Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are	999
	ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world	999
	will blow them down.	999
	999
Second Servant	Lepidus is high-coloured.	999
	999
First Servant	They have made him drink alms-drink.	999
	999
Second Servant	As they pinch one another by the disposition, he	999
	cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his	999
	entreaty, and himself to the drink.	999
	999
First Servant	But it raises the greater war between him and	999
	his discretion.	999
	999
Second Servant	Why, this is to have a name in great men's	999
	fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do	999
	me no service as a partisan I could not heave.	999
	999
First Servant	To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen	999
	to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,	999
	which pitifully disaster the cheeks.	999
	999
	[A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK	999
	ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS,	999
	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR]  Thus do they, sir: they take	999
	the flow o' the Nile	999
	By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,	999
	By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth	999
	Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,	999
	The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman	999
	Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,	999
	And shortly comes to harvest.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	You've strange serpents there.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Ay, Lepidus.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the	999
	operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	They are so.	999
	999
POMPEY	Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!	999
	999
LEPIDUS	I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'	999
	pyramises are very goodly things; without	999
	contradiction, I have heard that.	999
	999
MENAS	[Aside to POMPEY]  Pompey, a word.	999
	999
POMPEY	[Aside to MENAS]                 Say in mine ear:	999
	what is't?	999
	999
MENAS	[Aside to POMPEY]  Forsake thy seat, I do beseech	999
	thee, captain,	999
	And hear me speak a word.	999
	999
POMPEY	[Aside to MENAS]  Forbear me till anon.	999
	This wine for Lepidus!	999
	999
LEPIDUS	What manner o' thing is your crocodile?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad	999
	as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,	999
	and moves with its own organs: it lives by that	999
	which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of	999
	it, it transmigrates.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	What colour is it of?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Of it own colour too.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	'Tis a strange serpent.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Will this description satisfy him?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a	999
	very epicure.	999
	999
POMPEY	[Aside to MENAS]  Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of	999
	that? away!	999
	Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?	999
	999
MENAS	[Aside to POMPEY]  If for the sake of merit thou	999
	wilt hear me,	999
	Rise from thy stool.	999
	999
POMPEY	[Aside to MENAS]  I think thou'rt mad.	999
	The matter?	999
	999
	[Rises, and walks aside]	999
	999
MENAS	I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.	999
	999
POMPEY	Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?	999
	Be jolly, lords.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	                  These quick-sands, Lepidus,	999
	Keep off them, for you sink.	999
	999
MENAS	Wilt thou be lord of all the world?	999
	999
POMPEY	What say'st thou?	999
	999
MENAS	Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.	999
	999
POMPEY	How should that be?	999
	999
MENAS	But entertain it,	999
	And, though thou think me poor, I am the man	999
	Will give thee all the world.	999
	999
POMPEY	Hast thou drunk well?	999
	999
MENAS	Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.	999
	Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:	999
	Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,	999
	Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.	999
	999
POMPEY	Show me which way.	999
	999
MENAS	These three world-sharers, these competitors,	999
	Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;	999
	And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:	999
	All there is thine.	999
	999
POMPEY	Ah, this thou shouldst have done,	999
	And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;	999
	In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,	999
	'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;	999
	Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue	999
	Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,	999
	I should have found it afterwards well done;	999
	But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.	999
	999
MENAS	[Aside]  For this,	999
	I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.	999
	Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,	999
	Shall never find it more.	999
	999
POMPEY	This health to Lepidus!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Here's to thee, Menas!	999
	999
MENAS	Enobarbus, welcome!	999
	999
POMPEY	Fill till the cup be hid.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	There's a strong fellow, Menas.	999
	999
	[Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS]	999
	999
MENAS	Why?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st	999
	not?	999
	999
MENAS	The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,	999
	That it might go on wheels!	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Drink thou; increase the reels.	999
	999
MENAS	Come.	999
	999
POMPEY	This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?	999
	Here is to Caesar!	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  I could well forbear't.	999
	It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,	999
	And it grows fouler.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Be a child o' the time.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Possess it, I'll make answer:	999
	But I had rather fast from all four days	999
	Than drink so much in one.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Ha, my brave emperor!	999
	999
	[To MARK ANTONY]	999
	999
	Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,	999
	And celebrate our drink?	999
	999
POMPEY	Let's ha't, good soldier.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Come, let's all take hands,	999
	Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense	999
	In soft and delicate Lethe.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	All take hands.	999
	Make battery to our ears with the loud music:	999
	The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;	999
	The holding every man shall bear as loud	999
	As his strong sides can volley.	999
	999
	[Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them	999
	hand in hand]	999
	THE SONG.	999
	999
	Come, thou monarch of the vine,	999
	Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!	999
	In thy fats our cares be drown'd,	999
	With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:	999
	Cup us, till the world go round,	999
	Cup us, till the world go round!	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,	999
	Let me request you off: our graver business	999
	Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;	999
	You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb	999
	Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue	999
	Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost	999
	Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.	999
	Good Antony, your hand.	999
	999
POMPEY	I'll try you on the shore.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	And shall, sir; give's your hand.	999
	999
POMPEY	O Antony,	999
	You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.	999
	Come, down into the boat.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Take heed you fall not.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS]	999
	999
	Menas, I'll not on shore.	999
	999
MENAS	No, to my cabin.	999
	These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!	999
	Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell	999
	To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!	999
	999
	[Sound a flourish, with drums]	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Ho! says a' There's my cap.	999
	999
MENAS	Ho! Noble captain, come.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A plain in Syria.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS,	999
	and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead	999
	body of PACORUS borne before him]	999
	999
VENTIDIUS	Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now	999
	Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death	999
	Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body	999
	Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,	999
	Pays this for Marcus Crassus.	999
	999
SILIUS	Noble Ventidius,	999
	Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,	999
	The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,	999
	Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither	999
	The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony	999
	Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and	999
	Put garlands on thy head.	999
	999
VENTIDIUS	O Silius, Silius,	999
	I have done enough; a lower place, note well,	999
	May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;	999
	Better to leave undone, than by our deed	999
	Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.	999
	Caesar and Antony have ever won	999
	More in their officer than person: Sossius,	999
	One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,	999
	For quick accumulation of renown,	999
	Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.	999
	Who does i' the wars more than his captain can	999
	Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,	999
	The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,	999
	Than gain which darkens him.	999
	I could do more to do Antonius good,	999
	But 'twould offend him; and in his offence	999
	Should my performance perish.	999
	999
SILIUS	Thou hast, Ventidius,	999
	that	999
	Without the which a soldier, and his sword,	999
	Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!	999
	999
VENTIDIUS	I'll humbly signify what in his name,	999
	That magical word of war, we have effected;	999
	How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,	999
	The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia	999
	We have jaded out o' the field.	999
	999
SILIUS	Where is he now?	999
	999
VENTIDIUS	He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste	999
	The weight we must convey with's will permit,	999
	We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	999
	at another]	999
	999
AGRIPPA	What, are the brothers parted?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;	999
	The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps	999
	To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,	999
	Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled	999
	With the green sickness.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	'Tis a noble Lepidus.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!	999
	999
AGRIPPA	Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!	999
	999
AGRIPPA	O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:	999
	Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,	999
	poets, cannot	999
	Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!	999
	His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,	999
	Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	Both he loves.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	They are his shards, and he their beetle.	999
	999
	[Trumpets within]	999
			So;	999
	This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.	999
	999
	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	No further, sir.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You take from me a great part of myself;	999
	Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife	999
	As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band	999
	Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,	999
	Let not the piece of virtue, which is set	999
	Betwixt us as the cement of our love,	999
	To keep it builded, be the ram to batter	999
	The fortress of it; for better might we	999
	Have loved without this mean, if on both parts	999
	This be not cherish'd.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Make me not offended	999
	In your distrust.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  I have said.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	You shall not find,	999
	Though you be therein curious, the least cause	999
	For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,	999
	And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!	999
	We will here part.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:	999
	The elements be kind to thee, and make	999
	Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.	999
	999
OCTAVIA	My noble brother!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,	999
	And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.	999
	999
OCTAVIA	Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	What, Octavia?	999
	999
OCTAVIA	       I'll tell you in your ear.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can	999
	Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's	999
	down-feather,	999
	That stands upon the swell at full of tide,	999
	And neither way inclines.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside to AGRIPPA]  Will Caesar weep?	999
	999
AGRIPPA	[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  He has a cloud in 's face.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside to AGRIPPA]  He were the worse for that,	999
	were he a horse;	999
	So is he, being a man.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  Why, Enobarbus,	999
	When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,	999
	He cried almost to roaring; and he wept	999
	When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside to AGRIPPA]  That year, indeed, he was	999
	troubled with a rheum;	999
	What willingly he did confound he wail'd,	999
	Believe't, till I wept too.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	No, sweet Octavia,	999
	You shall hear from me still; the time shall not	999
	Out-go my thinking on you.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Come, sir, come;	999
	I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:	999
	Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,	999
	And give you to the gods.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Adieu; be happy!	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Let all the number of the stars give light	999
	To thy fair way!	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Farewell, farewell!	999
	999
	[Kisses OCTAVIA]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Farewell!	999

	999
	999
SCENE III	Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Where is the fellow?	999
	999
ALEXAS	Half afeard to come.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Go to, go to.	999
	999
	[Enter the Messenger as before]	999
	999
	Come hither, sir.	999
	999
ALEXAS	Good majesty,	999
	Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you	999
	But when you are well pleased.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	That Herod's head	999
	I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone	999
	Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.	999
	999
Messenger	Most gracious majesty,--	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Didst thou behold Octavia?	999
	999
Messenger	Ay, dread queen.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Where?	999
	999
Messenger	Madam, in Rome;	999
	I look'd her in the face, and saw her led	999
	Between her brother and Mark Antony.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Is she as tall as me?	999
	999
Messenger	She is not, madam.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?	999
	999
Messenger	Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	That's not so good: he cannot like her long.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!	999
	What majesty is in her gait? Remember,	999
	If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.	999
	999
Messenger	She creeps:	999
	Her motion and her station are as one;	999
	She shows a body rather than a life,	999
	A statue than a breather.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Is this certain?	999
	999
Messenger	Or I have no observance.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Three in Egypt	999
	Cannot make better note.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	He's very knowing;	999
	I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:	999
	The fellow has good judgment.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Excellent.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Guess at her years, I prithee.	999
	999
Messenger	Madam,	999
	She was a widow,--	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	                  Widow! Charmian, hark.	999
	999
Messenger	And I do think she's thirty.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?	999
	999
Messenger	Round even to faultiness.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.	999
	Her hair, what colour?	999
	999
Messenger	Brown, madam: and her forehead	999
	As low as she would wish it.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	There's gold for thee.	999
	Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:	999
	I will employ thee back again; I find thee	999
	Most fit for business: go make thee ready;	999
	Our letters are prepared.	999
	999
	[Exit Messenger]	999
	999
CHARMIAN	A proper man.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Indeed, he is so: I repent me much	999
	That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,	999
	This creature's no such thing.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Nothing, madam.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,	999
	And serving you so long!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:	999
	But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me	999
	Where I will write. All may be well enough.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	I warrant you, madam.	999

SCENE IV	Athens. A room in MARK ANTONY's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter MARK ANTONY and OCTAVIA]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--	999
	That were excusable, that, and thousands more	999
	Of semblable import,--but he hath waged	999
	New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it	999
	To public ear:	999
	Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not	999
	But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly	999
	He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:	999
	When the best hint was given him, he not took't,	999
	Or did it from his teeth.	999
	999
OCTAVIA	O my good lord,	999
	Believe not all; or, if you must believe,	999
	Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,	999
	If this division chance, ne'er stood between,	999
	Praying for both parts:	999
	The good gods me presently,	999
	When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'	999
	Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,	999
	'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,	999
	Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway	999
	'Twixt these extremes at all.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Gentle Octavia,	999
	Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks	999
	Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,	999
	I lose myself: better I were not yours	999
	Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,	999
	Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,	999
	I'll raise the preparation of a war	999
	Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;	999
	So your desires are yours.	999
	999
OCTAVIA	Thanks to my lord.	999
	The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,	999
	Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be	999
	As if the world should cleave, and that slain men	999
	Should solder up the rift.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	When it appears to you where this begins,	999
	Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults	999
	Can never be so equal, that your love	999
	Can equally move with them. Provide your going;	999
	Choose your own company, and command what cost	999
	Your heart has mind to.	999

	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	How now, friend Eros!	999
	999
EROS	There's strange news come, sir.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	What, man?	999
	999
EROS	Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	This is old: what is the success?	999
	999
EROS	Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst	999
	Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let	999
	him partake in the glory of the action: and not	999
	resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly	999
	wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so	999
	the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;	999
	And throw between them all the food thou hast,	999
	They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?	999
	999
EROS	He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns	999
	The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'	999
	And threats the throat of that his officer	999
	That murder'd Pompey.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Our great navy's rigg'd.	999
	999
EROS	For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;	999
	My lord desires you presently: my news	999
	I might have told hereafter.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	'Twill be naught:	999
	But let it be. Bring me to Antony.	999

SCENE VI	Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS]	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,	999
	In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:	999
	I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,	999
	Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold	999
	Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat	999
	Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,	999
	And all the unlawful issue that their lust	999
	Since then hath made between them. Unto her	999
	He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her	999
	Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,	999
	Absolute queen.	999
	999
MECAENAS	                  This in the public eye?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	I' the common show-place, where they exercise.	999
	His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:	999
	Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.	999
	He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd	999
	Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she	999
	In the habiliments of the goddess Isis	999
	That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,	999
	As 'tis reported, so.	999
	999
MECAENAS	Let Rome be thus Inform'd.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	Who, queasy with his insolence	999
	Already, will their good thoughts call from him.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	The people know it; and have now received	999
	His accusations.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	                  Who does he accuse?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Caesar: and that, having in Sicily	999
	Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him	999
	His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me	999
	Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets	999
	That Lepidus of the triumvirate	999
	Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain	999
	All his revenue.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	                  Sir, this should be answer'd.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.	999
	I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;	999
	That he his high authority abused,	999
	And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,	999
	I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,	999
	And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I	999
	Demand the like.	999
	999
MECAENAS	                  He'll never yield to that.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Nor must not then be yielded to in this.	999
	999
	[Enter OCTAVIA with her train]	999
	999
OCTAVIA	Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	That ever I should call thee castaway!	999
	999
OCTAVIA	You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not	999
	Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony	999
	Should have an army for an usher, and	999
	The neighs of horse to tell of her approach	999
	Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way	999
	Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,	999
	Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust	999
	Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,	999
	Raised by your populous troops: but you are come	999
	A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented	999
	The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,	999
	Is often left unloved; we should have met you	999
	By sea and land; supplying every stage	999
	With an augmented greeting.	999
	999
OCTAVIA	Good my lord,	999
	To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did	999
	On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,	999
	Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted	999
	My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd	999
	His pardon for return.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Which soon he granted,	999
	Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.	999
	999
OCTAVIA	Do not say so, my lord.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	I have eyes upon him,	999
	And his affairs come to me on the wind.	999
	Where is he now?	999
	999
OCTAVIA	                  My lord, in Athens.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra	999
	Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire	999
	Up to a whore; who now are levying	999
	The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled	999
	Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,	999
	Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king	999
	Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;	999
	King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;	999
	Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king	999
	Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,	999
	The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,	999
	With a more larger list of sceptres.	999
	999
OCTAVIA	Ay me, most wretched,	999
	That have my heart parted betwixt two friends	999
	That do afflict each other!	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Welcome hither:	999
	Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;	999
	Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,	999
	And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;	999
	Be you not troubled with the time, which drives	999
	O'er your content these strong necessities;	999
	But let determined things to destiny	999
	Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;	999
	Nothing more dear to me. You are abused	999
	Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,	999
	To do you justice, make them ministers	999
	Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;	999
	And ever welcome to us.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	Welcome, lady.	999
	999
MECAENAS	Welcome, dear madam.	999
	Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:	999
	Only the adulterous Antony, most large	999
	In his abominations, turns you off;	999
	And gives his potent regiment to a trull,	999
	That noises it against us.	999
	999
OCTAVIA	Is it so, sir?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,	999
	Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!	999

	999
SCENE VII	Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I will be even with thee, doubt it not.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	But why, why, why?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,	999
	And say'st it is not fit.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Well, is it, is it?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	If not denounced against us, why should not we	999
	Be there in person?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside]  Well, I could reply:	999
	If we should serve with horse and mares together,	999
	The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear	999
	A soldier and his horse.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	What is't you say?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;	999
	Take from his heart, take from his brain,	999
	from's time,	999
	What should not then be spared. He is already	999
	Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome	999
	That Photinus an eunuch and your maids	999
	Manage this war.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	                  Sink Rome, and their tongues rot	999
	That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,	999
	And, as the president of my kingdom, will	999
	Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:	999
	I will not stay behind.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Nay, I have done.	999
	Here comes the emperor.	999
	999
	[Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Is it not strange, Canidius,	999
	That from Tarentum and Brundusium	999
	He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,	999
	And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Celerity is never more admired	999
	Than by the negligent.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	A good rebuke,	999
	Which might have well becomed the best of men,	999
	To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we	999
	Will fight with him by sea.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	By sea! what else?	999
	999
CANIDIUS	Why will my lord do so?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	For that he dares us to't.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	So hath my lord dared him to single fight.	999
	999
CANIDIUS	Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.	999
	Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,	999
	Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;	999
	And so should you.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	                  Your ships are not well mann'd;	999
	Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people	999
	Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet	999
	Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:	999
	Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace	999
	Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,	999
	Being prepared for land.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	By sea, by sea.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Most worthy sir, you therein throw away	999
	The absolute soldiership you have by land;	999
	Distract your army, which doth most consist	999
	Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted	999
	Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego	999
	The way which promises assurance; and	999
	Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,	999
	From firm security.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I'll fight at sea.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Our overplus of shipping will we burn;	999
	And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium	999
	Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,	999
	We then can do't at land.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
		    Thy business?	999
	999
Messenger	The news is true, my lord; he is descried;	999
	Caesar has taken Toryne.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;	999
	Strange that power should be. Canidius,	999
	Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,	999
	And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:	999
	Away, my Thetis!	999
	999
	[Enter a Soldier]	999
	999
	How now, worthy soldier?	999
	999
Soldier	O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;	999
	Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt	999
	This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians	999
	And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we	999
	Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,	999
	And fighting foot to foot.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Well, well: away!	999
	999
	[Exeunt MARK ANTONY, QUEEN CLEOPATRA, and DOMITIUS	999
	ENOBARBUS]	999
	999
Soldier	By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.	999
	999
CANIDIUS	Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows	999
	Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,	999
	And we are women's men.	999
	999
Soldier	You keep by land	999
	The legions and the horse whole, do you not?	999
	999
CANIDIUS	Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,	999
	Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:	999
	But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's	999
	Carries beyond belief.	999
	999
Soldier	While he was yet in Rome,	999
	His power went out in such distractions as	999
	Beguiled all spies.	999
	999
CANIDIUS	Who's his lieutenant, hear you?	999
	999
Soldier	They say, one Taurus.	999
	999
CANIDIUS	Well I know the man.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	The emperor calls Canidius.	999
	999
CANIDIUS	With news the time's with labour, and throes forth,	999
	Each minute, some.	999

OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Taurus!	999
	999
TAURUS	My lord?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Strike not by land; keep whole: provoke not battle,	999
	Till we have done at sea. Do not exceed	999

	999
	[Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:	999
	The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,	999
	With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:	999
	To see't mine eyes are blasted.	999
	999
	[Enter SCARUS]	999
	999
SCARUS	Gods and goddesses,	999
	All the whole synod of them!	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	What's thy passion!	999
	999
SCARUS	The greater cantle of the world is lost	999
	With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away	999
	Kingdoms and provinces.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	How appears the fight?	999
	999
SCARUS	On our side like the token'd pestilence,	999
	Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--	999
	Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,	999
	When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,	999
	Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,	999
	The breese upon her, like a cow in June,	999
	Hoists sails and flies.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	That I beheld:	999
	Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not	999
	Endure a further view.	999
	999
SCARUS	She once being loof'd,	999
	The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,	999
	Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,	999
	Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:	999
	I never saw an action of such shame;	999
	Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before	999
	Did violate so itself.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Alack, alack!	999
	999
	[Enter CANIDIUS]	999
	999
CANIDIUS	Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,	999
	And sinks most lamentably. Had our general	999
	Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:	999
	O, he has given example for our flight,	999
	Most grossly, by his own!	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Ay, are you thereabouts?	999
	Why, then, good night indeed.	999
	999
CANIDIUS	Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.	999
	999
SCARUS	'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend	999
	What further comes.	999
	999
CANIDIUS	To Caesar will I render	999
	My legions and my horse: six kings already	999
	Show me the way of yielding.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I'll yet follow	999

	[Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;	999
	It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:	999
	I am so lated in the world, that I	999
	Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship	999
	Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,	999
	And make your peace with Caesar.	999
	999
All	Fly! not we.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards	999
	To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;	999
	I have myself resolved upon a course	999
	Which has no need of you; be gone:	999
	My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,	999
	I follow'd that I blush to look upon:	999
	My very hairs do mutiny; for the white	999
	Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them	999
	For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall	999
	Have letters from me to some friends that will	999
	Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,	999
	Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint	999
	Which my despair proclaims; let that be left	999
	Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:	999
	I will possess you of that ship and treasure.	999
	Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:	999
	Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,	999
	Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.	999

MARK ANTONY	Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept	999
	His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck	999
	The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I	999
	That the mad Brutus ended: he alone	999
	Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had	999
	In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Ah, stand by.	999
	999
EROS	The queen, my lord, the queen.	999
	999
IRAS	Go to him, madam, speak to him:	999
	He is unqualitied with very shame.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Well then, sustain him: O!	999
	999
EROS	Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:	999
	Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but	999
	Your comfort makes the rescue.	999

MARK ANTONY	O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,	999
	How I convey my shame out of thine eyes	999
	By looking back what I have left behind	999
	'Stroy'd in dishonour.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	O my lord, my lord,	999
	Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought	999
	You would have follow'd.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Egypt, thou knew'st too well	999
	My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,	999
	And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit	999
	Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that	999
	Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods	999
	Command me.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	          O, my pardon!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Now I must	999
	To the young man send humble treaties, dodge	999
	And palter in the shifts of lowness; who	999
	With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,	999
	Making and marring fortunes. You did know	999
	How much you were my conqueror; and that	999
	My sword, made weak by my affection, would	999
	Obey it on all cause.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Pardon, pardon!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates	999
	All that is won and lost: give me a kiss;	999
	Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;	999
	Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead.	999
	Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows	999
	We scorn her most when most she offers blows.	999

SCENE XII	Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others]	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Let him appear that's come from Antony.	999
	Know you him?	999
	999
DOLABELLA	                  Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:	999
	An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither	999
	He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,	999
	Which had superfluous kings for messengers	999
	Not many moons gone by.	999
	999
	[Enter EUPHRONIUS, ambassador from MARK ANTONY]	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Approach, and speak.	999
	999
EUPHRONIUS	Such as I am, I come from Antony:	999
	I was of late as petty to his ends	999
	As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf	999
	To his grand sea.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  Be't so: declare thine office.	999
	999
EUPHRONIUS	Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and	999
	Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,	999
	He lessens his requests; and to thee sues	999
	To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,	999
	A private man in Athens: this for him.	999
	Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;	999
	Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves	999
	The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,	999
	Now hazarded to thy grace.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	For Antony,	999
	I have no ears to his request. The queen	999
	Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she	999
	From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,	999
	Or take his life there: this if she perform,	999
	She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.	999
	999
EUPHRONIUS	Fortune pursue thee!	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Bring him through the bands.	999
	999
	[Exit EUPHRONIUS]	999
	999
	[To THYREUS]  To try eloquence, now 'tis time: dispatch;	999
	From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,	999
	And in our name, what she requires; add more,	999
	From thine invention, offers: women are not	999
	In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure	999
	The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;	999
	Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we	999
	Will answer as a law.	999
	999
THYREUS	Caesar, I go.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,	999
	And what thou think'st his very action speaks	999
	In every power that moves.	999
	999
THYREUS	Caesar, I shall.	999

SCENE XIII	Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	What shall we do, Enobarbus?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Think, and die.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Is Antony or we in fault for this?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Antony only, that would make his will	999
	Lord of his reason. What though you fled	999
	From that great face of war, whose several ranges	999
	Frighted each other? why should he follow?	999
	The itch of his affection should not then	999
	Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,	999
	When half to half the world opposed, he being	999
	The meered question: 'twas a shame no less	999
	Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,	999
	And leave his navy gazing.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Prithee, peace.	999
	999
	[Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Is that his answer?	999
	999
EUPHRONIUS	Ay, my lord.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	The queen shall then have courtesy, so she	999
	Will yield us up.	999
	999
EUPHRONIUS	                  He says so.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Let her know't.	999
	To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,	999
	And he will fill thy wishes to the brim	999
	With principalities.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	That head, my lord?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	To him again: tell him he wears the rose	999
	Of youth upon him; from which the world should note	999
	Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,	999
	May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail	999
	Under the service of a child as soon	999
	As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore	999
	To lay his gay comparisons apart,	999
	And answer me declined, sword against sword,	999
	Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.	999
	999
	[Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS]	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside]  Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will	999
	Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,	999
	Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are	999
	A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward	999
	Do draw the inward quality after them,	999
	To suffer all alike. That he should dream,	999
	Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will	999
	Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued	999
	His judgment too.	999
	999
	[Enter an Attendant]	999
	999
Attendant	                  A messenger from CAESAR.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	What, no more ceremony? See, my women!	999
	Against the blown rose may they stop their nose	999
	That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.	999
	999
	[Exit Attendant]	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside]  Mine honesty and I begin to square.	999
	The loyalty well held to fools does make	999
	Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure	999
	To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord	999
	Does conquer him that did his master conquer	999
	And earns a place i' the story.	999
	999
	[Enter THYREUS]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Caesar's will?	999
	999
THYREUS	Hear it apart.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	                  None but friends: say boldly.	999
	999
THYREUS	So, haply, are they friends to Antony.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;	999
	Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master	999
	Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,	999
	Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.	999
	999
THYREUS	So.	999
	Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,	999
	Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,	999
	Further than he is Caesar.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Go on: right royal.	999
	999
THYREUS	He knows that you embrace not Antony	999
	As you did love, but as you fear'd him.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	O!	999
	999
THYREUS	The scars upon your honour, therefore, he	999
	Does pity, as constrained blemishes,	999
	Not as deserved.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	                  He is a god, and knows	999
	What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,	999
	But conquer'd merely.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside]             To be sure of that,	999
	I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,	999
	That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for	999
	Thy dearest quit thee.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
THYREUS	Shall I say to Caesar	999
	What you require of him? for he partly begs	999
	To be desired to give. It much would please him,	999
	That of his fortunes you should make a staff	999
	To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,	999
	To hear from me you had left Antony,	999
	And put yourself under his shrowd,	999
	The universal landlord.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	What's your name?	999
	999
THYREUS	My name is Thyreus.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Most kind messenger,	999
	Say to great Caesar this: in deputation	999
	I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt	999
	To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:	999
	Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear	999
	The doom of Egypt.	999
	999
THYREUS	'Tis your noblest course.	999
	Wisdom and fortune combating together,	999
	If that the former dare but what it can,	999
	No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay	999
	My duty on your hand.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Your Caesar's father oft,	999
	When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,	999
	Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,	999
	As it rain'd kisses.	999
	999
	[Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Favours, by Jove that thunders!	999
	What art thou, fellow?	999
	999
THYREUS	One that but performs	999
	The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest	999
	To have command obey'd.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside]               You will be whipp'd.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods	999
	and devils!	999
	Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'	999
	Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,	999
	And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am	999
	Antony yet.	999
	999
	[Enter Attendants]	999
	999
	Take hence this Jack, and whip him.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside]  'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp	999
	Than with an old one dying.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Moon and stars!	999
	Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries	999
	That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them	999
	So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,	999
	Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,	999
	Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,	999
	And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.	999
	999
THYREUS	Mark Antony!	999
	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	                  Tug him away: being whipp'd,	999
	Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall	999
	Bear us an errand to him.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS]	999
	999
	You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!	999
	Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,	999
	Forborne the getting of a lawful race,	999
	And by a gem of women, to be abused	999
	By one that looks on feeders?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Good my lord,--	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	You have been a boggler ever:	999
	But when we in our viciousness grow hard--	999
	O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;	999
	In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us	999
	Adore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut	999
	To our confusion.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	                  O, is't come to this?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I found you as a morsel cold upon	999
	Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment	999
	Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,	999
	Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have	999
	Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,	999
	Though you can guess what temperance should be,	999
	You know not what it is.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Wherefore is this?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	To let a fellow that will take rewards	999
	And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with	999
	My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal	999
	And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were	999
	Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar	999
	The horned herd! for I have savage cause;	999
	And to proclaim it civilly, were like	999
	A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank	999
	For being yare about him.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS]	999
	999
		    Is he whipp'd?	999
	999
First Attendant	Soundly, my lord.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	                  Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?	999
	999
First Attendant	He did ask favour.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	If that thy father live, let him repent	999
	Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry	999
	To follow Caesar in his triumph, since	999
	Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth	999
	The white hand of a lady fever thee,	999
	Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,	999
	Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say	999
	He makes me angry with him; for he seems	999
	Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,	999
	Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;	999
	And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,	999
	When my good stars, that were my former guides,	999
	Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires	999
	Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike	999
	My speech and what is done, tell him he has	999
	Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom	999
	He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,	999
	As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:	999
	Hence with thy stripes, begone!	999
	999
	[Exit THYREUS]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Have you done yet?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	                  Alack, our terrene moon	999
	Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone	999
	The fall of Antony!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I must stay his time.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes	999
	With one that ties his points?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Not know me yet?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Cold-hearted toward me?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Ah, dear, if I be so,	999
	From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,	999
	And poison it in the source; and the first stone	999
	Drop in my neck: as it determines, so	999
	Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!	999
	Till by degrees the memory of my womb,	999
	Together with my brave Egyptians all,	999
	By the discandying of this pelleted storm,	999
	Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile	999
	Have buried them for prey!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I am satisfied.	999
	Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where	999
	I will oppose his fate. Our force by land	999
	Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too	999
	Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.	999
	Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?	999
	If from the field I shall return once more	999
	To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;	999
	I and my sword will earn our chronicle:	999
	There's hope in't yet.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	That's my brave lord!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,	999
	And fight maliciously: for when mine hours	999
	Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives	999
	Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,	999
	And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,	999
	Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me	999
	All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;	999
	Let's mock the midnight bell.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	It is my birth-day:	999
	I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord	999
	Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	We will yet do well.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Call all his noble captains to my lord.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force	999
	The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;	999
	There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,	999
	I'll make death love me; for I will contend	999
	Even with his pestilent scythe.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,	999
	Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood	999
	The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,	999
	A diminution in our captain's brain	999
	Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,	999
	It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek	999
	Some way to leave him.	999

	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with	999
	his Army; OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter]	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power	999
	To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger	999
	He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,	999
	Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know	999
	I have many other ways to die; meantime	999
	Laugh at his challenge.	999
	999
MECAENAS	Caesar must think,	999
	When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted	999
	Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now	999
	Make boot of his distraction: never anger	999
	Made good guard for itself.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Let our best heads	999
	Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles	999
	We mean to fight: within our files there are,	999
	Of those that served Mark Antony but late,	999
	Enough to fetch him in. See it done:	999
	And feast the army; we have store to do't,	999
	And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!	999

MARK ANTONY	He will not fight with me, Domitius.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	No.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Why should he not?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,	999
	He is twenty men to one.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	To-morrow, soldier,	999
	By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,	999
	Or bathe my dying honour in the blood	999
	Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Well said; come on.	999

	And kings have been your fellows.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What means this?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  'Tis one of those odd	999
	tricks which sorrow shoots	999
	Out of the mind.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	                  And thou art honest too.	999
	I wish I could be made so many men,	999
	And all of you clapp'd up together in	999
	An Antony, that I might do you service	999
	So good as you have done.	999
	999
All	The gods forbid!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:	999
	Scant not my cups; and make as much of me	999
	As when mine empire was your fellow too,	999
	And suffer'd my command.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What does he mean?	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  To make his followers weep.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Tend me to-night;	999
	May be it is the period of your duty:	999
	Haply you shall not see me more; or if,	999
	A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow	999
	You'll serve another master. I look on you	999
	As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,	999
	I turn you not away; but, like a master	999
	Married to your good service, stay till death:	999
	Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,	999
	And the gods yield you for't!	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	What mean you, sir,	999
	To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;	999
	And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,	999
	Transform us not to women.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Ho, ho, ho!	999
	Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!	999
	Grace grow where those drops fall!	999
	My hearty friends,	999
	You take me in too dolorous a sense;	999
	For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you	999
	To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,	999
	I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you	999
	Where rather I'll expect victorious life	999
	Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,	999
	And drown consideration.	999

	999
Second Soldier	It will determine one way: fare you well.	999
	Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?	999
	999
First Soldier	Nothing. What news?	999
	999
Second Soldier	Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.	999
	999
First Soldier	Well, sir, good night.	999
	999

	999
Second Soldier	Soldiers, have careful watch.	999
	999
Third Soldier	And you. Good night, good night.	999
	999
	[They place themselves in every corner of the stage]	999
	999
Fourth Soldier	Here we: and if to-morrow	999
	Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope	999
	Our landmen will stand up.	999
	999
Third Soldier	'Tis a brave army,	999
	And full of purpose.	999
	999
	[Music of the hautboys as under the stage]	999
	999
Fourth Soldier	Peace! what noise?	999
	999
First Soldier	List, list!	999
	999
Second Soldier	Hark!	999
	999
First Soldier	    Music i' the air.	999

Third Soldier	Under the earth.	999
	999
Fourth Soldier	It signs well, does it not?	999
	999
Third Soldier	No.	999
	999
First Soldier	Peace, I say!	999
	What should this mean?	999
	999
Second Soldier	'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,	999
	Now leaves him.	999
	999
First Soldier	Walk; let's see if other watchmen	999
	Do hear what we do?	999
	999
	[They advance to another post]	999
	999
Second Soldier	How now, masters!	999
	999
All	[Speaking together]  How now!	999
	How now! do you hear this?	999
	999
First Soldier	Ay; is't not strange?	999
	999
Third Soldier	Do you hear, masters? do you hear?	999
	999
First Soldier	Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;	999

	999
MARK ANTONY	No, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!	999
	999
	[Enter EROS with armour]	999
	999
	Come good fellow, put mine iron on:	999
	If fortune be not ours to-day, it is	999
	Because we brave her: come.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Nay, I'll help too.	999
	What's this for?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	                  Ah, let be, let be! thou art	999
	The armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Well, well;	999
	We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?	999
	Go put on thy defences.	999
	999
EROS	Briefly, sir.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Is not this buckled well?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Rarely, rarely:	999
	He that unbuckles this, till we do please	999
	To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.	999
	Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire	999
	More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,	999
	That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st	999
	The royal occupation! thou shouldst see	999
	A workman in't.	999
	999
	[Enter an armed Soldier]	999
	999
	Good morrow to thee; welcome:	999
	Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:	999
	To business that we love we rise betime,	999
	And go to't with delight.	999
	999
Soldier	A thousand, sir,	999
	Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,	999
	And at the port expect you.	999
	999

All	Good morrow, general.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	'Tis well blown, lads:	999
	This morning, like the spirit of a youth	999
	That means to be of note, begins betimes.	999
	So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.	999
	Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:	999
	This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable	999
	999
	[Kisses her]	999
	999
	And worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand	999
	On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee	999
	Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight,	999
	Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.	999

	999
Soldier	The gods make this a happy day to Antony!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd	999
	To make me fight at land!	999
	999
Soldier	Hadst thou done so,	999
	The kings that have revolted, and the soldier	999
	That has this morning left thee, would have still	999
	Follow'd thy heels.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Who's gone this morning?	999
	999
Soldier	Who!	999
	One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,	999
	He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp	999
	Say 'I am none of thine.'	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	What say'st thou?	999
	999
Soldier	Sir,	999
	He is with Caesar.	999

EROS	                  Sir, his chests and treasure	999

	999
MARK ANTONY	Is he gone?	999
	999
Soldier	Most certain.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;	999
	Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--	999
	I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;	999
	Say that I wish he never find more cause	999

	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999

Messenger	Antony	999
	Is come into the field.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Go charge Agrippa	999
	Plant those that have revolted in the van,	999

	Upon himself.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on	999
	Affairs of Antony; there did persuade	999
	Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,	999
	And leave his master Antony: for this pains	999
	Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest	999
	That fell away have entertainment, but	999
	No honourable trust. I have done ill;	999
	Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,	999
	That I will joy no more.	999
	999
	[Enter a Soldier of CAESAR's]	999
	999
Soldier	Enobarbus, Antony	999
	Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with	999

	Unloading of his mules.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I give it you.	999
	999
Soldier	Mock not, Enobarbus.	999
	I tell you true: best you safed the bringer	999
	Out of the host; I must attend mine office,	999
	Or would have done't myself. Your emperor	999
	Continues still a Jove.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I am alone the villain of the earth,	999
	And feel I am so most. O Antony,	999
	Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid	999
	My better service, when my turpitude	999
	Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:	999
	If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean	999
	Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.	999
	I fight against thee! No: I will go seek	999
	Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits	999

	999
MARK ANTONY	Thou bleed'st apace.	999
	999
SCARUS	I had a wound here that was like a T,	999
	But now 'tis made an H.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	They do retire.	999

EROS	They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves	999

	And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:	999
	'Tis sport to maul a runner.	999

MARK ANTONY	I will reward thee	999

MARK ANTONY	We have beat him to his camp: run one before,	999
	And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,	999
	Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood	999
	That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;	999
	For doughty-handed are you, and have fought	999
	Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been	999
	Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.	999
	Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,	999
	Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears	999

	Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,	999
	Through proof of harness to my heart, and there	999
	Ride on the pants triumphing!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Lord of lords!	999
	O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from	999
	The world's great snare uncaught?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	My nightingale,	999
	We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!	999
	though grey	999
	Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we	999
	A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can	999
	Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;	999
	Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:	999
	Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day	999
	As if a god, in hate of mankind, had	999
	Destroy'd in such a shape.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I'll give thee, friend,	999
	An armour all of gold; it was a king's.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	He has deserved it, were it carbuncled	999
	Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:	999
	Through Alexandria make a jolly march;	999
	Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:	999
	Had our great palace the capacity	999
	To camp this host, we all would sup together,	999
	And drink carouses to the next day's fate,	999
	Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,	999
	With brazen din blast you the city's ear;	999

Second Soldier	                  Stand close, and list him.	999

DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,	999

	Before thy face repent!	999
	999
First Soldier	Enobarbus!	999
	999
Third Soldier	Peace!	999
	Hark further.	999
	999
DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,	999
	The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,	999
	That life, a very rebel to my will,	999
	May hang no longer on me: throw my heart	999
	Against the flint and hardness of my fault:	999
	Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,	999
	And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,	999
	Nobler than my revolt is infamous,	999
	Forgive me in thine own particular;	999
	But let the world rank me in register	999
	A master-leaver and a fugitive:	999
	O Antony! O Antony!	999

	999
Third Soldier	Let's do so. But he sleeps.	999
	999
First Soldier	Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his	999
	Was never yet for sleep.	999
	999
Second Soldier	Go we to him.	999

Third Soldier	Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.	999

	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	But being charged, we will be still by land,	999

	[Enter MARK ANTONY and SCARUS]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Yet they are not join'd: where yond pine	999

	I shall discover all: I'll bring thee word	999
	Straight, how 'tis like to go.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SCARUS	Swallows have built	999
	In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers	999
	Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,	999
	And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony	999
	Is valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,	999
	His fretted fortunes give him hope, and fear,	999
	Of what he has, and has not.	999
	999
	[Alarum afar off, as at a sea-fight]	999
	999
	[Re-enter MARK ANTONY]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	All is lost;	999
	This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:	999
	My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder	999
	They cast their caps up and carouse together	999
	Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!	999
	'tis thou	999
	Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart	999
	Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;	999
	For when I am revenged upon my charm,	999
	I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.	999
	999
	[Exit SCARUS]	999
	999
	O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:	999
	Fortune and Antony part here; even here	999
	Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts	999
	That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave	999
	Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets	999
	On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,	999
	That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:	999
	O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--	999
	Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;	999
	Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--	999
	Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,	999
	Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.	999
	What, Eros, Eros!	999
	999
	[Enter CLEOPATRA]	999
	999
	Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Why is my lord enraged against his love?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,	999
	And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,	999
	And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:	999
	Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot	999
	Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown	999
	For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let	999
	Patient Octavia plough thy visage up	999
	With her prepared nails.	999
	999
	[Exit CLEOPATRA]	999
	999
		'Tis well thou'rt gone,	999
	If it be well to live; but better 'twere	999
	Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death	999
	Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!	999
	The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,	999
	Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:	999
	Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;	999
	And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,	999
	Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:	999
	To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall	999
	Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!	999

	Was never so emboss'd.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	To the monument!	999
	There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.	999
	The soul and body rive not more in parting	999
	Than greatness going off.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	To the monument!	999
	Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;	999
	Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'	999

	[Enter MARK ANTONY and EROS]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Eros, thou yet behold'st me?	999
	999
EROS	Ay, noble lord.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;	999
	A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,	999
	A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,	999
	A forked mountain, or blue promontory	999
	With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,	999
	And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen	999
	these signs;	999
	They are black vesper's pageants.	999
	999
EROS	Ay, my lord,	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	That which is now a horse, even with a thought	999
	The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,	999
	As water is in water.	999
	999
EROS	It does, my lord.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	My good knave Eros, now thy captain is	999
	Even such a body: here I am Antony:	999
	Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.	999
	I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--	999
	Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;	999
	Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't	999
	A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has	999
	Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory	999
	Unto an enemy's triumph.	999
	Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us	999
	Ourselves to end ourselves.	999
	999
	[Enter MARDIAN]	999
	999
		      O! thy vile lady!	999
	She has robb'd me of my sword.	999
	999
MARDIAN	No, Antony;	999
	My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled	999
	With thine entirely.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!	999
	She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.	999
	999
MARDIAN	Death of one person can be paid but once,	999
	And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do	999
	Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake	999
	Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'	999
	Then in the midst a tearing groan did break	999
	The name of Antony; it was divided	999
	Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,	999
	Thy name so buried in her.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Dead, then?	999
	999
MARDIAN	Dead.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,	999
	And we must sleep.	999
	999
	[To MARDIAN]	999
	999
	That thou depart'st hence safe,	999
	Does pay thy labour richly; go.	999
	999
	[Exit MARDIAN]	999
	999
		         Off, pluck off:	999
	The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep	999
	The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!	999
	Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,	999
	Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.	999
	No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;	999
	You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.	999
	999
	[Exit EROS]	999
	999
	I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and	999
	Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now	999
	All length is torture: since the torch is out,	999
	Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour	999
	Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles	999
	Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done.	999
	Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me:	999
	Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,	999
	And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:	999
	Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,	999
	And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!	999
	999
	[Re-enter EROS]	999
	999
EROS	What would my lord?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Since Cleopatra died,	999
	I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods	999
	Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword	999
	Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back	999
	With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack	999
	The courage of a woman; less noble mind	999
	Than she which by her death our Caesar tells	999
	'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,	999
	That, when the exigent should come, which now	999
	Is come indeed, when I should see behind me	999
	The inevitable prosecution of	999
	Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,	999
	Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:	999
	Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.	999
	Put colour in thy cheek.	999
	999
EROS	The gods withhold me!	999
	Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,	999
	Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Eros,	999
	Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see	999
	Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down	999
	His corrigible neck, his face subdued	999
	To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat	999
	Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded	999
	His baseness that ensued?	999
	999
EROS	I would not see't.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.	999
	Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn	999
	Most useful for thy country.	999
	999
EROS	O, sir, pardon me!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then	999
	To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;	999
	Or thy precedent services are all	999
	But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.	999
	999
EROS	Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,	999
	Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Lo thee!	999
	999
	[Turning from him]	999
	999
EROS	My sword is drawn.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	                  Then let it do at once	999
	The thing why thou hast drawn it.	999
	999
EROS	My dear master,	999
	My captain, and my emperor, let me say,	999
	Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	'Tis said, man; and farewell.	999
	999
EROS	Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Now, Eros.	999
	999
EROS	Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow	999
	Of Antony's death.	999
	999
	[Kills himself]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	                  Thrice-nobler than myself!	999
	Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what	999
	I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros	999
	Have by their brave instruction got upon me	999
	A nobleness in record: but I will be	999
	A bridegroom in my death, and run into't	999
	As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,	999
	Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus	999
	999
	[Falling on his sword]	999
	999
	I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?	999
	The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!	999
	999
	[Enter DERCETAS and Guard]	999
	999
First Guard	What's the noise?	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I have done my work in, friends: O, make an end	999
	Of what I have begun.	999
	999
Second Guard	The star is fall'n.	999
	999
First Guard	And time is at his period.	999
	999
All	Alas, and woe!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Let him that loves me strike me dead.	999
	999
First Guard	Not I.	999
	999
Second Guard	Nor I.	999
	999
Third Guard	Nor any one.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Guard]	999
	999
DERCETAS	Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.	999
	This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,	999
	Shall enter me with him.	999
	999
	[Enter DIOMEDES]	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Where's Antony?	999
	999
DERCETAS	                  There, Diomed there.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Lives he?	999
	Wilt thou not answer, man?	999
	999
	[Exit DERCETAS]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me	999
	Sufficing strokes for death.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Most absolute lord,	999
	My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	When did she send thee?	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Now, my lord.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Where is she?	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear	999
	Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--	999
	Which never shall be found--you did suspect	999
	She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage	999
	Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;	999
	But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent	999
	Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,	999
	I dread, too late.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!	999
	Come, your lord calls!	999
	999
	[Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY]	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;	999
	'Tis the last service that I shall command you.	999
	999
First Guard	Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear	999
	All your true followers out.	999
	999
All	Most heavy day!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate	999
	To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome	999
	Which comes to punish us, and we punish it	999
	Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:	999
	I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,	999
	And have my thanks for all.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with	999
	CHARMIAN and IRAS]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	O Charmian, I will never go from hence.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Be comforted, dear madam.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	No, I will not:	999
	All strange and terrible events are welcome,	999
	But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,	999
	Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great	999
	As that which makes it.	999
	999
	[Enter, below, DIOMEDES]	999
	999
		  How now! is he dead?	999
	999
DIOMEDES	His death's upon him, but not dead.	999
	Look out o' the other side your monument;	999
	His guard have brought him thither.	999
	999
	[Enter, below, MARK ANTONY, borne by the Guard]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	O sun,	999
	Burn the great sphere thou movest in!	999
	darkling stand	999
	The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,	999
	Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;	999
	Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Peace!	999
	Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,	999
	But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	So it should be, that none but Antony	999
	Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I am dying, Egypt, dying; only	999
	I here importune death awhile, until	999
	Of many thousand kisses the poor last	999
	I lay up thy lips.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	                  I dare not, dear,--	999
	Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,	999
	Lest I be taken: not the imperious show	999
	Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall	999
	Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,	999
	serpents, have	999
	Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:	999
	Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes	999
	And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour	999
	Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--	999
	Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:	999
	Assist, good friends.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	O, quick, or I am gone.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!	999
	Our strength is all gone into heaviness,	999
	That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,	999
	The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,	999
	And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--	999
	Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;	999
	999
	[They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA]	999
	999
	And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:	999
	Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,	999
	Thus would I wear them out.	999
	999
All	A heavy sight!	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	I am dying, Egypt, dying:	999
	Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,	999
	That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,	999
	Provoked by my offence.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	One word, sweet queen:	999
	Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	They do not go together.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	Gentle, hear me:	999
	None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	My resolution and my hands I'll trust;	999
	None about Caesar.	999
	999
MARK ANTONY	The miserable change now at my end	999
	Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts	999
	In feeding them with those my former fortunes	999
	Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,	999
	The noblest; and do now not basely die,	999
	Not cowardly put off my helmet to	999
	My countryman,--a Roman by a Roman	999
	Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;	999
	I can no more.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	                  Noblest of men, woo't die?	999
	Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide	999
	In this dull world, which in thy absence is	999
	No better than a sty? O, see, my women,	999
	999
	[MARK ANTONY dies]	999
	999
	The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!	999
	O, wither'd is the garland of the war,	999
	The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls	999
	Are level now with men; the odds is gone,	999
	And there is nothing left remarkable	999
	Beneath the visiting moon.	999
	999
	[Faints]	999
	999
CHARMIAN	O, quietness, lady!	999
	999
IRAS	She is dead too, our sovereign.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Lady!	999
	999
IRAS	Madam!	999
	999
CHARMIAN	O madam, madam, madam!	999
	999
IRAS	Royal Egypt, Empress!	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Peace, peace, Iras!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded	999
	By such poor passion as the maid that milks	999
	And does the meanest chares. It were for me	999
	To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;	999
	To tell them that this world did equal theirs	999
	Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;	999
	Patience is scottish, and impatience does	999
	Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin	999
	To rush into the secret house of death,	999
	Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?	999
	What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!	999
	My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,	999
	Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:	999
	We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,	999
	what's noble,	999
	Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,	999
	And make death proud to take us. Come, away:	999
	This case of that huge spirit now is cold:	999
	Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend	999
	But resolution, and the briefest end.	999

	999
	999
SCENE I	Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS,	999
	GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war]	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;	999
	Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks	999
	The pauses that he makes.	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Caesar, I shall.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY]	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest	999
	Appear thus to us?	999
	999
DERCETAS	                  I am call'd Dercetas;	999
	Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy	999
	Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,	999
	He was my master; and I wore my life	999
	To spend upon his haters. If thou please	999
	To take me to thee, as I was to him	999
	I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,	999
	I yield thee up my life.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	What is't thou say'st?	999
	999
DERCETAS	I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	The breaking of so great a thing should make	999
	A greater crack: the round world	999
	Should have shook lions into civil streets,	999
	And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony	999
	Is not a single doom; in the name lay	999
	A moiety of the world.	999
	999
DERCETAS	He is dead, Caesar:	999
	Not by a public minister of justice,	999
	Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,	999
	Which writ his honour in the acts it did,	999
	Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,	999
	Splitted the heart. This is his sword;	999
	I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd	999
	With his most noble blood.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Look you sad, friends?	999
	The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings	999
	To wash the eyes of kings.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	And strange it is,	999
	That nature must compel us to lament	999
	Our most persisted deeds.	999
	999
MECAENAS	His taints and honours	999
	Waged equal with him.	999
	999
AGRIPPA	A rarer spirit never	999
	Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us	999
	Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.	999
	999
MECAENAS	When such a spacious mirror's set before him,	999
	He needs must see himself.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	O Antony!	999
	I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance	999
	Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce	999
	Have shown to thee such a declining day,	999
	Or look on thine; we could not stall together	999
	In the whole world: but yet let me lament,	999
	With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,	999
	That thou, my brother, my competitor	999
	In top of all design, my mate in empire,	999
	Friend and companion in the front of war,	999
	The arm of mine own body, and the heart	999
	Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,	999
	Unreconciliable, should divide	999
	Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--	999
	But I will tell you at some meeter season:	999
	999
	[Enter an Egyptian]	999
	999
	The business of this man looks out of him;	999
	We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?	999
	999
Egyptian	A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,	999
	Confined in all she has, her monument,	999
	Of thy intents desires instruction,	999
	That she preparedly may frame herself	999
	To the way she's forced to.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Bid her have good heart:	999
	She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,	999
	How honourable and how kindly we	999
	Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live	999
	To be ungentle.	999
	999
Egyptian	So the gods preserve thee!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,	999
	We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts	999
	The quality of her passion shall require,	999
	Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke	999
	She do defeat us; for her life in Rome	999
	Would be eternal in our triumph: go,	999
	And with your speediest bring us what she says,	999
	And how you find of her.	999
	999
PROCULEIUS	Caesar, I shall.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Gallus, go you along.	999
	999
	[Exit GALLUS]	999
	999
		Where's Dolabella,	999
	To second Proculeius?	999
	999
All	Dolabella!	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Let him alone, for I remember now	999
	How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.	999
	Go with me to my tent; where you shall see	999
	How hardly I was drawn into this war;	999
	How calm and gentle I proceeded still	999
	In all my writings: go with me, and see	999
	What I can show in this.	999

ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Alexandria. A room in the monument.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	My desolation does begin to make	999
	A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;	999
	Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,	999
	A minister of her will: and it is great	999
	To do that thing that ends all other deeds;	999
	Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;	999
	Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,	999
	The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.	999
	999
	[Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS,	999
	GALLUS and Soldiers]	999
	999
PROCULEIUS	Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;	999
	And bids thee study on what fair demands	999
	Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	What's thy name?	999
	999
PROCULEIUS	My name is Proculeius.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Antony	999
	Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but	999
	I do not greatly care to be deceived,	999
	That have no use for trusting. If your master	999
	Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,	999
	That majesty, to keep decorum, must	999
	No less beg than a kingdom: if he please	999
	To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,	999
	He gives me so much of mine own, as I	999
	Will kneel to him with thanks.	999
	999
PROCULEIUS	Be of good cheer;	999
	You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:	999
	Make your full reference freely to my lord,	999
	Who is so full of grace, that it flows over	999
	On all that need: let me report to him	999
	Your sweet dependency; and you shall find	999
	A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,	999
	Where he for grace is kneel'd to.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Pray you, tell him	999
	I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him	999
	The greatness he has got. I hourly learn	999
	A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly	999
	Look him i' the face.	999
	999
PROCULEIUS	This I'll report, dear lady.	999
	Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied	999
	Of him that caused it.	999
	999
GALLUS	You see how easily she may be surprised:	999
	999
	[Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the	999
	monument by a ladder placed against a window, and,	999
	having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of	999
	the Guard unbar and open the gates]	999
	999
	[To PROCULEIUS and the Guard]	999
	999
	Guard her till Caesar come.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
IRAS	Royal queen!	999
	999
CHARMIAN	O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Quick, quick, good hands.	999
	999
	[Drawing a dagger]	999
	999
PROCULEIUS	Hold, worthy lady, hold:	999
	999
	[Seizes and disarms her]	999
	999
	Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this	999
	Relieved, but not betray'd.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	What, of death too,	999
	That rids our dogs of languish?	999
	999
PROCULEIUS	Cleopatra,	999
	Do not abuse my master's bounty by	999
	The undoing of yourself: let the world see	999
	His nobleness well acted, which your death	999
	Will never let come forth.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Where art thou, death?	999
	Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen	999
	Worthy many babes and beggars!	999
	999
PROCULEIUS	O, temperance, lady!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;	999
	If idle talk will once be necessary,	999
	I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,	999
	Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I	999
	Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;	999
	Nor once be chastised with the sober eye	999
	Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up	999
	And show me to the shouting varletry	999
	Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt	999
	Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud	999
	Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies	999
	Blow me into abhorring! rather make	999
	My country's high pyramides my gibbet,	999
	And hang me up in chains!	999
	999
PROCULEIUS	You do extend	999
	These thoughts of horror further than you shall	999
	Find cause in Caesar.	999
	999
	[Enter DOLABELLA]	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Proculeius,	999
	What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,	999
	And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,	999
	I'll take her to my guard.	999
	999
PROCULEIUS	So, Dolabella,	999
	It shall content me best: be gentle to her.	999
	999
	[To CLEOPATRA]	999
	999
	To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,	999
	If you'll employ me to him.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Say, I would die.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers]	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Most noble empress, you have heard of me?	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I cannot tell.	999
	999
DOLABELLA	                  Assuredly you know me.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.	999
	You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;	999
	Is't not your trick?	999
	999
DOLABELLA	I understand not, madam.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:	999
	O, such another sleep, that I might see	999
	But such another man!	999
	999
DOLABELLA	If it might please ye,--	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck	999
	A sun and moon, which kept their course,	999
	and lighted	999
	The little O, the earth.	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Most sovereign creature,--	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm	999
	Crested the world: his voice was propertied	999
	As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;	999
	But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,	999
	He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,	999
	There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas	999
	That grew the more by reaping: his delights	999
	Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above	999
	The element they lived in: in his livery	999
	Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were	999
	As plates dropp'd from his pocket.	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Cleopatra!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Think you there was, or might be, such a man	999
	As this I dream'd of?	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Gentle madam, no.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.	999
	But, if there be, or ever were, one such,	999
	It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff	999
	To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine	999
	And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,	999
	Condemning shadows quite.	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Hear me, good madam.	999
	Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it	999
	As answering to the weight: would I might never	999
	O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,	999
	By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites	999
	My very heart at root.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	I thank you, sir,	999
	Know you what Caesar means to do with me?	999
	999
DOLABELLA	I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Nay, pray you, sir,--	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Though he be honourable,--	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	He'll lead me, then, in triumph?	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Madam, he will; I know't.	999
	999
	[Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there:	999
	Octavius Caesar!']	999
	999
	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS,	999
	MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train]	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Which is the Queen of Egypt?	999
	999
DOLABELLA	It is the emperor, madam.	999
	999
	[CLEOPATRA kneels]	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Arise, you shall not kneel:	999
	I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Sir, the gods	999
	Will have it thus; my master and my lord	999
	I must obey.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  Take to you no hard thoughts:	999
	The record of what injuries you did us,	999
	Though written in our flesh, we shall remember	999
	As things but done by chance.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Sole sir o' the world,	999
	I cannot project mine own cause so well	999
	To make it clear; but do confess I have	999
	Been laden with like frailties which before	999
	Have often shamed our sex.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Cleopatra, know,	999
	We will extenuate rather than enforce:	999
	If you apply yourself to our intents,	999
	Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find	999
	A benefit in this change; but if you seek	999
	To lay on me a cruelty, by taking	999
	Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself	999
	Of my good purposes, and put your children	999
	To that destruction which I'll guard them from,	999
	If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,	999
	Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall	999
	Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,	999
	I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;	999
	Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?	999
	999
SELEUCUS	Here, madam.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,	999
	Upon his peril, that I have reserved	999
	To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.	999
	999
SELEUCUS	Madam,	999
	I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,	999
	Speak that which is not.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	What have I kept back?	999
	999
SELEUCUS	Enough to purchase what you have made known.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve	999
	Your wisdom in the deed.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	See, Caesar! O, behold,	999
	How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;	999
	And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.	999
	The ingratitude of this Seleucus does	999
	Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust	999
	Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt	999
	Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,	999
	Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!	999
	O rarely base!	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  Good queen, let us entreat you.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,	999
	That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,	999
	Doing the honour of thy lordliness	999
	To one so meek, that mine own servant should	999
	Parcel the sum of my disgraces by	999
	Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,	999
	That I some lady trifles have reserved,	999
	Immoment toys, things of such dignity	999
	As we greet modern friends withal; and say,	999
	Some nobler token I have kept apart	999
	For Livia and Octavia, to induce	999
	Their mediation; must I be unfolded	999
	With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me	999
	Beneath the fall I have.	999
	999
	[To SELEUCUS]	999
	999
		   Prithee, go hence;	999
	Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits	999
	Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,	999
	Thou wouldst have mercy on me.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Forbear, Seleucus.	999
	999
	[Exit SELEUCUS]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought	999
	For things that others do; and, when we fall,	999
	We answer others' merits in our name,	999
	Are therefore to be pitied.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Cleopatra,	999
	Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,	999
	Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,	999
	Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,	999
	Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you	999
	Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;	999
	Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;	999
	For we intend so to dispose you as	999
	Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:	999
	Our care and pity is so much upon you,	999
	That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	My master, and my lord!	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Not so. Adieu.	999
	999
	[Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not	999
	Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.	999
	999
	[Whispers CHARMIAN]	999
	999
IRAS	Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,	999
	And we are for the dark.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Hie thee again:	999
	I have spoke already, and it is provided;	999
	Go put it to the haste.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Madam, I will.	999
	999
	[Re-enter DOLABELLA]	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Where is the queen?	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Behold, sir.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Dolabella!	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,	999
	Which my love makes religion to obey,	999
	I tell you this: Caesar through Syria	999
	Intends his journey; and within three days	999
	You with your children will he send before:	999
	Make your best use of this: I have perform'd	999
	Your pleasure and my promise.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Dolabella,	999
	I shall remain your debtor.	999
	999
DOLABELLA	I your servant,	999
	Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Farewell, and thanks.	999
	999
	[Exit DOLABELLA]	999
	999
		Now, Iras, what think'st thou?	999
	Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown	999
	In Rome, as well as I	mechanic slaves	999
	With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall	999
	Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,	999
	Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,	999
	And forced to drink their vapour.	999
	999
IRAS	The gods forbid!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors	999
	Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers	999
	Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians	999
	Extemporally will stage us, and present	999
	Our Alexandrian revels; Antony	999
	Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see	999
	Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness	999
	I' the posture of a whore.	999
	999
IRAS	O the good gods!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Nay, that's certain.	999
	999
IRAS	I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails	999
	Are stronger than mine eyes.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Why, that's the way	999
	To fool their preparation, and to conquer	999
	Their most absurd intents.	999
	999
	[Re-enter CHARMIAN]	999
	999
		     Now, Charmian!	999
	Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch	999
	My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,	999
	To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.	999
	Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;	999
	And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave	999
	To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.	999
	Wherefore's this noise?	999
	999
	[Exit IRAS. A noise within]	999
	999
	[Enter a Guardsman]	999
	999
Guard	Here is a rural fellow	999
	That will not be denied your highness presence:	999
	He brings you figs.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Let him come in.	999
	999
	[Exit Guardsman]	999
	999
	What poor an instrument	999
	May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.	999
	My resolution's placed, and I have nothing	999
	Of woman in me: now from head to foot	999
	I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon	999
	No planet is of mine.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket]	999
	999
Guard	This is the man.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Avoid, and leave him.	999
	999
	[Exit Guardsman]	999
	999
	Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,	999
	That kills and pains not?	999
	999
Clown	Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party	999
	that should desire you to touch him, for his biting	999
	is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or	999
	never recover.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Rememberest thou any that have died on't?	999
	999
Clown	Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of	999
	them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,	999
	but something given to lie; as a woman should not	999
	do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the	999
	biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes	999
	a very good report o' the worm; but he that will	999
	believe all that they say, shall never be saved by	999
	half that they do: but this is most fallible, the	999
	worm's an odd worm.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Get thee hence; farewell.	999
	999
Clown	I wish you all joy of the worm.	999
	999
	[Setting down his basket]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Farewell.	999
	999
Clown	You must think this, look you, that the worm will	999
	do his kind.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Ay, ay; farewell.	999
	999
Clown	Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the	999
	keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no	999
	goodness in worm.	999
	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.	999
	999
Clown	Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is	999
	not worth the feeding.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Will it eat me?	999
	999
Clown	You must not think I am so simple but I know the	999
	devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a	999
	woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her	999
	not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the	999
	gods great harm in their women; for in every ten	999
	that they make, the devils mar five.	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Well, get thee gone; farewell.	999
	999
Clown	Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Re-enter IRAS with a robe, crown, &c]	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have	999
	Immortal longings in me: now no more	999
	The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:	999
	Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear	999
	Antony call; I see him rouse himself	999
	To praise my noble act; I hear him mock	999
	The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men	999
	To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:	999
	Now to that name my courage prove my title!	999
	I am fire and air; my other elements	999
	I give to baser life. So; have you done?	999
	Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.	999
	Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.	999
	999
	[Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies]	999
	999
	Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?	999
	If thou and nature can so gently part,	999
	The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,	999
	Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?	999
	If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world	999
	It is not worth leave-taking.	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,	999
	The gods themselves do weep!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	This proves me base:	999
	If she first meet the curled Antony,	999
	He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss	999
	Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou	999
	mortal wretch,	999
	999
	[To an asp, which she applies to her breast]	999
	999
	With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate	999
	Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool	999
	Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,	999
	That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass	999
	Unpolicied!	999
	999
CHARMIAN	          O eastern star!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	Peace, peace!	999
	Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,	999
	That sucks the nurse asleep?	999
	999
CHARMIAN	O, break! O, break!	999
	999
CLEOPATRA	As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--	999
	O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.	999
	999
	[Applying another asp to her arm]	999
	999
	What should I stay--	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
CHARMIAN	In this vile world? So, fare thee well.	999
	Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies	999
	A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;	999
	And golden Phoebus never be beheld	999
	Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;	999
	I'll mend it, and then play.	999
	999
	[Enter the Guard, rushing in]	999
	999
First Guard	Where is the queen?	999
	999
CHARMIAN	Speak softly, wake her not.	999
	999
First Guard	Caesar hath sent--	999
	999
CHARMIAN	                  Too slow a messenger.	999
	999
	[Applies an asp]	999
	999
	O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.	999
	999
First Guard	Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.	999
	999
Second Guard	There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.	999
	999
First Guard	What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?	999
	999
CHARMIAN	It is well done, and fitting for a princess	999
	Descended of so many royal kings.	999
	Ah, soldier!	999
	999
	[Dies]	999

	[Re-enter DOLABELLA]	999
	999
DOLABELLA	How goes it here?	999
	999
Second Guard	                  All dead.	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Caesar, thy thoughts	999
	Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming	999
	To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou	999
	So sought'st to hinder.	999
	999
	[Within  'A way there, a way for Caesar!']	999
	999
	[Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching]	999
	999
DOLABELLA	O sir, you are too sure an augurer;	999
	That you did fear is done.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Bravest at the last,	999
	She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,	999
	Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?	999
	I do not see them bleed.	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Who was last with them?	999
	999
First Guard	A simple countryman, that brought her figs:	999
	This was his basket.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Poison'd, then.	999
	999
First Guard	O Caesar,	999
	This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:	999
	I found her trimming up the diadem	999
	On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood	999
	And on the sudden dropp'd.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	O noble weakness!	999
	If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear	999
	By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,	999
	As she would catch another Antony	999
	In her strong toil of grace.	999
	999
DOLABELLA	Here, on her breast,	999
	There is a vent of blood and something blown:	999
	The like is on her arm.	999
	999
First Guard	This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves	999
	Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves	999
	Upon the caves of Nile.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Most probable	999
	That so she died; for her physician tells me	999
	She hath pursued conclusions infinite	999
	Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;	999
	And bear her women from the monument:	999
	She shall be buried by her Antony:	999
	No grave upon the earth shall clip in it	999
	A pair so famous. High events as these	999
	Strike those that make them; and their story is	999
	No less in pity than his glory which	999
	Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall	999
	In solemn show attend this funeral;	999
	And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see	999
	High order in this great solemnity.	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Rome. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves,	999
	clubs, and other weapons]	999
	999
First Citizen	Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.	999
	999
All	Speak, speak.	999
	999
First Citizen	You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?	999
	999
All	Resolved. resolved.	999
	999
First Citizen	First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.	999
	999
All	We know't, we know't.	999
	999
First Citizen	Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.	999
	Is't a verdict?	999
	999
All	No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!	999
	999
Second Citizen	One word, good citizens.	999
	999
First Citizen	We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.	999
	What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they	999
	would yield us but the superfluity, while it were	999
	wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;	999
	but they think we are too dear: the leanness that	999
	afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an	999
	inventory to particularise their abundance; our	999
	sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with	999
	our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I	999
	speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?	999
	999
All	Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Consider you what services he has done for his country?	999
	999
First Citizen	Very well; and could be content to give him good	999
	report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Nay, but speak not maliciously.	999
	999
First Citizen	I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did	999
	it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be	999
	content to say it was for his country he did it to	999
	please his mother and to be partly proud; which he	999
	is, even till the altitude of his virtue.	999
	999
Second Citizen	What he cannot help in his nature, you account a	999
	vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.	999
	999
First Citizen	If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;	999
	he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.	999
	999
	[Shouts within]	999
	999
	What shouts are these? The other side o' the city	999
	is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!	999
	999
All	Come, come.	999
	999
First Citizen	Soft! who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA]	999
	999
Second Citizen	Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved	999
	the people.	999
	999
First Citizen	He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!	999
	999
MENENIUS	What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you	999
	With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.	999
	999
First Citizen	Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have	999
	had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,	999
	which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor	999
	suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we	999
	have strong arms too.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,	999
	Will you undo yourselves?	999
	999
First Citizen	We cannot, sir, we are undone already.	999
	999
MENENIUS	I tell you, friends, most charitable care	999
	Have the patricians of you. For your wants,	999
	Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well	999
	Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them	999
	Against the Roman state, whose course will on	999
	The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs	999
	Of more strong link asunder than can ever	999
	Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,	999
	The gods, not the patricians, make it, and	999
	Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,	999
	You are transported by calamity	999
	Thither where more attends you, and you slander	999
	The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,	999
	When you curse them as enemies.	999
	999
First Citizen	Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us	999
	yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses	999
	crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to	999
	support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act	999
	established against the rich, and provide more	999
	piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain	999
	the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and	999
	there's all the love they bear us.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Either you must	999
	Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,	999
	Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you	999
	A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;	999
	But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture	999
	To stale 't a little more.	999
	999
First Citizen	Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to	999
	fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please	999
	you, deliver.	999
	999
MENENIUS	There was a time when all the body's members	999
	Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:	999
	That only like a gulf it did remain	999
	I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,	999
	Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing	999
	Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments	999
	Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,	999
	And, mutually participate, did minister	999
	Unto the appetite and affection common	999
	Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--	999
	999
First Citizen	Well, sir, what answer made the belly?	999
	999
MENENIUS	Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,	999
	Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--	999
	For, look you, I may make the belly smile	999
	As well as speak--it tauntingly replied	999
	To the discontented members, the mutinous parts	999
	That envied his receipt; even so most fitly	999
	As you malign our senators for that	999
	They are not such as you.	999
	999
First Citizen	Your belly's answer? What!	999
	The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,	999
	The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,	999
	Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.	999
	With other muniments and petty helps	999
	In this our fabric, if that they--	999
	999
MENENIUS	What then?	999
	'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?	999
	999
First Citizen	Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,	999
	Who is the sink o' the body,--	999
	999
MENENIUS	Well, what then?	999
	999
First Citizen	The former agents, if they did complain,	999
	What could the belly answer?	999
	999
MENENIUS	I will tell you	999
	If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--	999
	Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.	999
	999
First Citizen	Ye're long about it.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Note me this, good friend;	999
	Your most grave belly was deliberate,	999
	Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:	999
	'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,	999
	'That I receive the general food at first,	999
	Which you do live upon; and fit it is,	999
	Because I am the store-house and the shop	999
	Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,	999
	I send it through the rivers of your blood,	999
	Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;	999
	And, through the cranks and offices of man,	999
	The strongest nerves and small inferior veins	999
	From me receive that natural competency	999
	Whereby they live: and though that all at once,	999
	You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--	999
	999
First Citizen	Ay, sir; well, well.	999
	999
MENENIUS	'Though all at once cannot	999
	See what I do deliver out to each,	999
	Yet I can make my audit up, that all	999
	From me do back receive the flour of all,	999
	And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?	999
	999
First Citizen	It was an answer: how apply you this?	999
	999
MENENIUS	The senators of Rome are this good belly,	999
	And you the mutinous members; for examine	999
	Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly	999
	Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find	999
	No public benefit which you receive	999
	But it proceeds or comes from them to you	999
	And no way from yourselves. What do you think,	999
	You, the great toe of this assembly?	999
	999
First Citizen	I the great toe! why the great toe?	999
	999
MENENIUS	For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,	999
	Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:	999
	Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,	999
	Lead'st first to win some vantage.	999
	But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:	999
	Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;	999
	The one side must have bale.	999
	999
	[Enter CAIUS MARCIUS]	999
	999
		       Hail, noble Marcius!	999
	999
MARCIUS	Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,	999
	That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,	999
	Make yourselves scabs?	999
	999
First Citizen	We have ever your good word.	999
	999
MARCIUS	He that will give good words to thee will flatter	999
	Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,	999
	That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,	999
	The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,	999
	Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;	999
	Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,	999
	Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,	999
	Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is	999
	To make him worthy whose offence subdues him	999
	And curse that justice did it.	999
	Who deserves greatness	999
	Deserves your hate; and your affections are	999
	A sick man's appetite, who desires most that	999
	Which would increase his evil. He that depends	999
	Upon your favours swims with fins of lead	999
	And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?	999
	With every minute you do change a mind,	999
	And call him noble that was now your hate,	999
	Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,	999
	That in these several places of the city	999
	You cry against the noble senate, who,	999
	Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else	999
	Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?	999
	999
MENENIUS	For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,	999
	The city is well stored.	999
	999
MARCIUS	Hang 'em! They say!	999
	They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know	999
	What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,	999
	Who thrives and who declines; side factions	999
	and give out	999
	Conjectural marriages; making parties strong	999
	And feebling such as stand not in their liking	999
	Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's	999
	grain enough!	999
	Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,	999
	And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry	999
	With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high	999
	As I could pick my lance.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;	999
	For though abundantly they lack discretion,	999
	Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,	999
	What says the other troop?	999
	999
MARCIUS	They are dissolved: hang 'em!	999
	They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,	999
	That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,	999
	That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not	999
	Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds	999
	They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,	999
	And a petition granted them, a strange one--	999
	To break the heart of generosity,	999
	And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps	999
	As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,	999
	Shouting their emulation.	999
	999
MENENIUS	What is granted them?	999
	999
MARCIUS	Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,	999
	Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,	999
	Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!	999
	The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,	999
	Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time	999
	Win upon power and throw forth greater themes	999
	For insurrection's arguing.	999
	999
MENENIUS	This is strange.	999
	999
MARCIUS	Go, get you home, you fragments!	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger, hastily]	999
	999
Messenger	Where's Caius Marcius?	999
	999
MARCIUS	Here: what's the matter?	999
	999
Messenger	The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.	999
	999
MARCIUS	I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent	999
	Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.	999
	999
	[Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators;	999
	JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS]	999
	999
First Senator	Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;	999
	The Volsces are in arms.	999
	999
MARCIUS	They have a leader,	999
	Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.	999
	I sin in envying his nobility,	999
	And were I any thing but what I am,	999
	I would wish me only he.	999
	999
COMINIUS	You have fought together.	999
	999
MARCIUS	Were half to half the world by the ears and he.	999
	Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make	999
	Only my wars with him: he is a lion	999
	That I am proud to hunt.	999
	999
First Senator	Then, worthy Marcius,	999
	Attend upon Cominius to these wars.	999
	999
COMINIUS	It is your former promise.	999
	999
MARCIUS	Sir, it is;	999
	And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou	999
	Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.	999
	What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?	999
	999
TITUS	No, Caius Marcius;	999
	I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,	999
	Ere stay behind this business.	999
	999
MENENIUS	O, true-bred!	999
	999
First Senator	Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,	999
	Our greatest friends attend us.	999
	999
TITUS	[To COMINIUS]                Lead you on.	999
	999
	[To MARCIUS]  Follow Cominius; we must follow you;	999
	Right worthy you priority.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Noble Marcius!	999
	999
First Senator	[To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone!	999
	999
MARCIUS	Nay, let them follow:	999
	The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither	999
	To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,	999
	Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.	999
	999
	[Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS	999
	and BRUTUS]	999
	999
SICINIUS	Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?	999
	999
BRUTUS	He has no equal.	999
	999
SICINIUS	When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--	999
	999
BRUTUS	Mark'd you his lip and eyes?	999
	999
SICINIUS	Nay. but his taunts.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Be-mock the modest moon.	999
	999
BRUTUS	The present wars devour him: he is grown	999
	Too proud to be so valiant.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Such a nature,	999
	Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow	999
	Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder	999
	His insolence can brook to be commanded	999
	Under Cominius.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Fame, at the which he aims,	999
	In whom already he's well graced, can not	999
	Better be held nor more attain'd than by	999
	A place below the first: for what miscarries	999
	Shall be the general's fault, though he perform	999
	To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure	999
	Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he	999
	Had borne the business!'	999
	999
SICINIUS	Besides, if things go well,	999
	Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall	999
	Of his demerits rob Cominius.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Come:	999
	Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.	999
	Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults	999
	To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed	999
	In aught he merit not.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Let's hence, and hear	999
	How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,	999
	More than his singularity, he goes	999
	Upon this present action.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Lets along.	999

	999
	[Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS and certain Senators]	999
	999
First Senator	So, your opinion is, Aufidius,	999
	That they of Rome are entered in our counsels	999
	And know how we proceed.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Is it not yours?	999
	What ever have been thought on in this state,	999
	That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome	999
	Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone	999
	Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think	999
	I have the letter here; yes, here it is.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'They have press'd a power, but it is not known	999
	Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;	999
	The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,	999
	Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,	999
	Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,	999
	And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,	999
	These three lead on this preparation	999
	Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:	999
	Consider of it.'	999
	999
First Senator	                  Our army's in the field	999
	We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready	999
	To answer us.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	                  Nor did you think it folly	999
	To keep your great pretences veil'd till when	999
	They needs must show themselves; which	999
	in the hatching,	999
	It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.	999
	We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was	999
	To take in many towns ere almost Rome	999
	Should know we were afoot.	999
	999
Second Senator	Noble Aufidius,	999
	Take your commission; hie you to your bands:	999
	Let us alone to guard Corioli:	999
	If they set down before 's, for the remove	999
	Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find	999
	They've not prepared for us.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	O, doubt not that;	999
	I speak from certainties. Nay, more,	999
	Some parcels of their power are forth already,	999
	And only hitherward. I leave your honours.	999
	If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,	999
	'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike	999
	Till one can do no more.	999
	999

SCENE III	Rome. A room in Marcius' house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA	they set them down	999
	on two low stools, and sew]	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a	999
	more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I	999
	should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he	999
	won honour than in the embracements of his bed where	999
	he would show most love. When yet he was but	999
	tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when	999
	youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when	999
	for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not	999
	sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering	999
	how honour would become such a person. that it was	999
	no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if	999
	renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek	999
	danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel	999
	war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows	999
	bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not	999
	more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child	999
	than now in first seeing he had proved himself a	999
	man.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	But had he died in the business, madam; how then?	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Then his good report should have been my son; I	999
	therein would have found issue. Hear me profess	999
	sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love	999
	alike and none less dear than thine and my good	999
	Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their	999
	country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.	999
	999
	[Enter a Gentlewoman]	999
	999
Gentlewoman	Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Indeed, you shall not.	999
	Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,	999
	See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,	999
	As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:	999
	Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:	999
	'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,	999
	Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow	999
	With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,	999
	Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow	999
	Or all or lose his hire.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Away, you fool! it more becomes a man	999
	Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,	999
	When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier	999
	Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood	999
	At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,	999
	We are fit to bid her welcome.	999
	999
	[Exit Gentlewoman]	999
	999
VIRGILIA	Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee	999
	And tread upon his neck.	999
	999
	[Enter VALERIA, with an Usher and Gentlewoman]	999
	999
VALERIA	My ladies both, good day to you.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Sweet madam.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	I am glad to see your ladyship.	999
	999
VALERIA	How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.	999
	What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good	999
	faith. How does your little son?	999
	999
VIRGILIA	I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than	999
	look upon his school-master.	999
	999
VALERIA	O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a	999
	very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'	999
	Wednesday half an hour together: has such a	999
	confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded	999
	butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go	999
	again; and after it again; and over and over he	999
	comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his	999
	fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his	999
	teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked	999
	it!	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	One on 's father's moods.	999
	999
VALERIA	Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	A crack, madam.	999
	999
VALERIA	Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play	999
	the idle husewife with me this afternoon.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	No, good madam; I will not out of doors.	999
	999
VALERIA	Not out of doors!	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	She shall, she shall.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the	999
	threshold till my lord return from the wars.	999
	999
VALERIA	Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,	999
	you must go visit the good lady that lies in.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with	999
	my prayers; but I cannot go thither.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Why, I pray you?	999
	999
VIRGILIA	'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.	999
	999
VALERIA	You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all	999
	the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill	999
	Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric	999
	were sensible as your finger, that you might leave	999
	pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.	999
	999
VALERIA	In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you	999
	excellent news of your husband.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	O, good madam, there can be none yet.	999
	999
VALERIA	Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from	999
	him last night.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	Indeed, madam?	999
	999
VALERIA	In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.	999
	Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against	999
	whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of	999
	our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set	999
	down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt	999
	prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,	999
	on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every	999
	thing hereafter.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but	999
	disease our better mirth.	999
	999
VALERIA	In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.	999
	Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy	999
	solemness out o' door. and go along with us.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish	999
	you much mirth.	999
	999

LARTIUS	My horse to yours, no.	999
	999
MARCIUS	'Tis done.	999
	999
LARTIUS	Agreed.	999

MARCIUS	Say, has our general met the enemy?	999
	999
Messenger	They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.	999
	999
LARTIUS	So, the good horse is mine.	999
	999
MARCIUS	I'll buy him of you.	999
	999
LARTIUS	No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will	999

	999
MARCIUS	How far off lie these armies?	999
	999
Messenger	Within this mile and half.	999

	Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,	999
	That we with smoking swords may march from hence,	999
	To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.	999

	Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;	999
	They'll open of themselves.	999
	999
	[Alarum afar off]	999

MARCIUS	They fear us not, but issue forth their city.	999
	Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight	999
	With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,	999
	brave Titus:	999
	They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,	999
	Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:	999
	He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,	999
	And he shall feel mine edge.	999
	999
	[Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their	999
	trenches. Re-enter MARCIUS cursing]	999
	999
MARCIUS	All the contagion of the south light on you,	999
	You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues	999
	Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd	999
	Further than seen and one infect another	999
	Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,	999
	That bear the shapes of men, how have you run	999
	From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!	999
	All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale	999
	With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,	999
	Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe	999
	And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;	999
	If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,	999
	As they us to our trenches followed.	999
	999
	[Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS	999
	follows them to the gates]	999
	999
	So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:	999
	'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,	999
	Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.	999
	999
	[Enters the gates]	999
	999
First Soldier	Fool-hardiness; not I.	999
	999
Second Soldier	Nor I.	999
	999
	[MARCIUS is shut in]	999
	999
First Soldier	See, they have shut him in.	999

	[Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS]	999
	999
LARTIUS	What is become of Marcius?	999
	999
All	Slain, sir, doubtless.	999
	999
First Soldier	Following the fliers at the very heels,	999
	With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,	999
	Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,	999
	To answer all the city.	999
	999
LARTIUS	O noble fellow!	999
	Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,	999
	And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:	999
	A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,	999
	Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier	999
	Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible	999
	Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and	999
	The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,	999
	Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world	999
	Were feverous and did tremble.	999
	999
	[Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy]	999
	999
First Soldier	Look, sir.	999

	999
	[Alarum continues still afar off]	999
	999
	[Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS with a trumpet]	999
	999
MARCIUS	See here these movers that do prize their hours	999
	At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,	999
	Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would	999
	Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,	999
	Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!	999
	And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!	999
	There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,	999
	Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take	999
	Convenient numbers to make good the city;	999
	Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste	999
	To help Cominius.	999
	999
LARTIUS	                  Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;	999
	Thy exercise hath been too violent for	999
	A second course of fight.	999
	999
MARCIUS	Sir, praise me not;	999
	My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:	999
	The blood I drop is rather physical	999
	Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus	999
	I will appear, and fight.	999
	999
LARTIUS	Now the fair goddess, Fortune,	999
	Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms	999
	Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,	999
	Prosperity be thy page!	999
	999
MARCIUS	Thy friend no less	999
	Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.	999
	999
LARTIUS	Thou worthiest Marcius!	999
	999
	[Exit MARCIUS]	999
	999
	Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;	999

	999
	999
	[Enter COMINIUS, as it were in retire,	999
	with soldiers]	999
	999
COMINIUS	Breathe you, my friends: well fought;	999
	we are come off	999
	Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,	999
	Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,	999
	We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,	999
	By interims and conveying gusts we have heard	999
	The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!	999
	Lead their successes as we wish our own,	999
	That both our powers, with smiling	999
	fronts encountering,	999
	May give you thankful sacrifice.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
		                  Thy news?	999
	999
Messenger	The citizens of Corioli have issued,	999
	And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:	999
	I saw our party to their trenches driven,	999
	And then I came away.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Though thou speak'st truth,	999
	Methinks thou speak'st not well.	999
	How long is't since?	999
	999
Messenger	Above an hour, my lord.	999
	999
COMINIUS	'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:	999
	How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,	999
	And bring thy news so late?	999
	999
Messenger	Spies of the Volsces	999
	Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel	999
	Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,	999
	Half an hour since brought my report.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Who's yonder,	999
	That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods	999
	He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have	999
	Before-time seen him thus.	999
	999
MARCIUS	[Within]                 Come I too late?	999
	999
COMINIUS	The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour	999
	More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue	999
	From every meaner man.	999
	999
	[Enter MARCIUS]	999
	999
MARCIUS	Come I too late?	999
	999
COMINIUS	Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,	999
	But mantled in your own.	999
	999
MARCIUS	O, let me clip ye	999
	In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart	999
	As merry as when our nuptial day was done,	999
	And tapers burn'd to bedward!	999
	999
COMINIUS	Flower of warriors,	999
	How is it with Titus Lartius?	999
	999
MARCIUS	As with a man busied about decrees:	999
	Condemning some to death, and some to exile;	999
	Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;	999
	Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,	999
	Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,	999
	To let him slip at will.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Where is that slave	999
	Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?	999
	Where is he? call him hither.	999
	999
MARCIUS	Let him alone;	999
	He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,	999
	The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--	999
	The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge	999
	From rascals worse than they.	999
	999
COMINIUS	But how prevail'd you?	999
	999
MARCIUS	Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.	999
	Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?	999
	If not, why cease you till you are so?	999
	999
COMINIUS	Marcius,	999
	We have at disadvantage fought and did	999
	Retire to win our purpose.	999
	999
MARCIUS	How lies their battle? know you on which side	999
	They have placed their men of trust?	999
	999
COMINIUS	As I guess, Marcius,	999
	Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,	999
	Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,	999
	Their very heart of hope.	999
	999
MARCIUS	I do beseech you,	999
	By all the battles wherein we have fought,	999
	By the blood we have shed together, by the vows	999
	We have made to endure friends, that you directly	999
	Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;	999
	And that you not delay the present, but,	999
	Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,	999
	We prove this very hour.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Though I could wish	999
	You were conducted to a gentle bath	999
	And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never	999
	Deny your asking: take your choice of those	999
	That best can aid your action.	999
	999
MARCIUS	Those are they	999
	That most are willing. If any such be here--	999
	As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting	999
	Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear	999
	Lesser his person than an ill report;	999
	If any think brave death outweighs bad life	999
	And that his country's dearer than himself;	999
	Let him alone, or so many so minded,	999
	Wave thus, to express his disposition,	999
	And follow Marcius.	999
	999
	[They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in	999
	their arms, and cast up their caps]	999
	999
	O, me alone! make you a sword of me?	999
	If these shows be not outward, which of you	999
	But is four Volsces? none of you but is	999
	Able to bear against the great Aufidius	999
	A shield as hard as his. A certain number,	999
	Though thanks to all, must I select	999
	from all: the rest	999
	Shall bear the business in some other fight,	999
	As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;	999
	And four shall quickly draw out my command,	999
	Which men are best inclined.	999
	999
COMINIUS	March on, my fellows:	999
	Make good this ostentation, and you shall	999
	Divide in all with us.	999

	999
LARTIUS	So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,	999
	As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch	999
	Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve	999
	For a short holding: if we lose the field,	999

	999
MARCIUS	I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee	999
	Worse than a promise-breaker.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	We hate alike:	999
	Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor	999
	More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.	999
	999
MARCIUS	Let the first budger die the other's slave,	999
	And the gods doom him after!	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	If I fly, Marcius,	999
	Holloa me like a hare.	999
	999
MARCIUS	Within these three hours, Tullus,	999
	Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,	999
	And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood	999
	Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge	999
	Wrench up thy power to the highest.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Wert thou the Hector	999
	That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,	999
	Thou shouldst not scape me here.	999
	999

	Enter, from one side, COMINIUS with the Romans; from	999
	the other side, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf]	999
	999
COMINIUS	If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,	999
	Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it	999
	Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,	999
	Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,	999
	I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,	999
	And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the	999
	dull tribunes,	999
	That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,	999
	Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods	999
	Our Rome hath such a soldier.'	999

	999
	[Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power,	999

	999
LARTIUS	O general,	999
	Here is the steed, we the caparison:	999
	Hadst thou beheld--	999
	999
MARCIUS	Pray now, no more: my mother,	999
	Who has a charter to extol her blood,	999
	When she does praise me grieves me. I have done	999
	As you have done; that's what I can; induced	999
	As you have been; that's for my country:	999
	He that has but effected his good will	999
	Hath overta'en mine act.	999
	999
COMINIUS	You shall not be	999
	The grave of your deserving; Rome must know	999
	The value of her own: 'twere a concealment	999
	Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,	999
	To hide your doings; and to silence that,	999
	Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,	999
	Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you	999
	In sign of what you are, not to reward	999
	What you have done--before our army hear me.	999
	999
MARCIUS	I have some wounds upon me, and they smart	999
	To hear themselves remember'd.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Should they not,	999
	Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,	999
	And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,	999
	Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all	999
	The treasure in this field achieved and city,	999
	We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,	999
	Before the common distribution, at	999
	Your only choice.	999
	999
MARCIUS	                  I thank you, general;	999
	But cannot make my heart consent to take	999
	A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;	999
	And stand upon my common part with those	999
	That have beheld the doing.	999
	999
	[A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!'	999
	cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and LARTIUS	999
	stand bare]	999
	999
MARCIUS	May these same instruments, which you profane,	999
	Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall	999
	I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be	999
	Made all of false-faced soothing!	999
	When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,	999
	Let him be made a coverture for the wars!	999
	No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd	999
	My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--	999
	Which, without note, here's many else have done,--	999
	You shout me forth	999
	In acclamations hyperbolical;	999
	As if I loved my little should be dieted	999
	In praises sauced with lies.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Too modest are you;	999
	More cruel to your good report than grateful	999
	To us that give you truly: by your patience,	999
	If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,	999
	Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,	999
	Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,	999
	As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius	999
	Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,	999
	My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,	999
	With all his trim belonging; and from this time,	999
	For what he did before Corioli, call him,	999
	With all the applause and clamour of the host,	999
	CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear	999
	The addition nobly ever!	999
	999
	[Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums]	999
	999
All	Caius Marcius Coriolanus!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I will go wash;	999
	And when my face is fair, you shall perceive	999
	Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.	999
	I mean to stride your steed, and at all times	999
	To undercrest your good addition	999
	To the fairness of my power.	999
	999
COMINIUS	So, to our tent;	999
	Where, ere we do repose us, we will write	999
	To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,	999
	Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome	999
	The best, with whom we may articulate,	999
	For their own good and ours.	999
	999
LARTIUS	I shall, my lord.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	The gods begin to mock me. I, that now	999
	Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg	999
	Of my lord general.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I sometime lay here in Corioli	999
	At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:	999
	He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;	999
	But then Aufidius was within my view,	999
	And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you	999
	To give my poor host freedom.	999
	999
COMINIUS	O, well begg'd!	999
	Were he the butcher of my son, he should	999
	Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.	999
	999
LARTIUS	Marcius, his name?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	                  By Jupiter! forgot.	999
	I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.	999
	Have we no wine here?	999
	999
COMINIUS	Go we to our tent:	999
	The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time	999
	It should be look'd to: come.	999

	What good condition can a treaty find	999
	I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,	999
	I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,	999
	And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter	999
	As often as we eat. By the elements,	999

	He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation	999
	Hath not that honour in't it had; for where	999
	I thought to crush him in an equal force,	999
	True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way	999
	Or wrath or craft may get him.	999
	999
First Soldier	He's the devil.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd	999
	With only suffering stain by him; for him	999
	Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,	999
	Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,	999
	The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,	999
	Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up	999
	Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst	999
	My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it	999
	At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,	999
	Against the hospitable canon, would I	999
	Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;	999
	Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must	999
	Be hostages for Rome.	999
	999
First Soldier	Will not you go?	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--	999
	'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither	999
	How the world goes, that to the pace of it	999
	I may spur on my journey.	999
	999
First Soldier	I shall, sir.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Rome. A public place.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people,	999
	SICINIUS and BRUTUS.	999
	999
MENENIUS	The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Good or bad?	999
	999
MENENIUS	Not according to the prayer of the people, for they	999
	love not Marcius.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Pray you, who does the wolf love?	999
	999
SICINIUS	The lamb.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the	999
	noble Marcius.	999
	999
BRUTUS	He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.	999
	999
MENENIUS	He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two	999
	are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.	999
	999
Both	Well, sir.	999
	999
MENENIUS	In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two	999
	have not in abundance?	999
	999
BRUTUS	He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Especially in pride.	999
	999
BRUTUS	And topping all others in boasting.	999
	999
MENENIUS	This is strange now: do you two know how you are	999
	censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the	999
	right-hand file? do you?	999
	999
Both	Why, how are we censured?	999
	999
MENENIUS	Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?	999
	999
Both	Well, well, sir, well.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of	999
	occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:	999
	give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at	999
	your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a	999
	pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for	999
	being proud?	999
	999
BRUTUS	We do it not alone, sir.	999
	999
MENENIUS	I know you can do very little alone; for your helps	999
	are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous	999
	single: your abilities are too infant-like for	999
	doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you	999
	could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,	999
	and make but an interior survey of your good selves!	999
	O that you could!	999
	999
BRUTUS	What then, sir?	999
	999
MENENIUS	Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,	999
	proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as	999
	any in Rome.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Menenius, you are known well enough too.	999
	999
MENENIUS	I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that	999
	loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying	999
	Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in	999
	favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like	999
	upon too trivial motion; one that converses more	999
	with the buttock of the night than with the forehead	999
	of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my	999
	malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as	999
	you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink	999
	you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a	999
	crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have	999
	delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in	999
	compound with the major part of your syllables: and	999
	though I must be content to bear with those that say	999
	you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that	999
	tell you you have good faces. If you see this in	999
	the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known	999
	well enough too? what barm can your bisson	999
	conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be	999
	known well enough too?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.	999
	999
MENENIUS	You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You	999
	are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you	999
	wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a	999
	cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;	999
	and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a	999
	second day of audience. When you are hearing a	999
	matter between party and party, if you chance to be	999
	pinched with the colic, you make faces like	999
	mummers; set up the bloody flag against all	999
	patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,	999
	dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled	999
	by your hearing: all the peace you make in their	999
	cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are	999
	a pair of strange ones.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Come, come, you are well understood to be a	999
	perfecter giber for the table than a necessary	999
	bencher in the Capitol.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall	999
	encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When	999
	you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the	999
	wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not	999
	so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's	999
	cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-	999
	saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;	999
	who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors	999
	since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the	999
	best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to	999
	your worships: more of your conversation would	999
	infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly	999
	plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.	999
	999
	[BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside]	999
	999
	[Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA]	999
	999
	How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,	999
	were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow	999
	your eyes so fast?	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for	999
	the love of Juno, let's go.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Ha! Marcius coming home!	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous	999
	approbation.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!	999
	Marcius coming home!	999
	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	|	999
	|  Nay,'tis true.	999
VIRGILIA	|	999
	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath	999
	another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one	999
	at home for you.	999
	999
MENENIUS	I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for	999
	me!	999
	999
VIRGILIA	Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.	999
	999
MENENIUS	A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven	999
	years' health; in which time I will make a lip at	999
	the physician: the most sovereign prescription in	999
	Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,	999
	of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he	999
	not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	O, no, no, no.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.	999
	999
MENENIUS	So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'	999
	victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home	999
	with the oaken garland.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but	999
	Aufidius got off.	999
	999
MENENIUS	And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:	999
	an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so	999
	fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold	999
	that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate	999
	has letters from the general, wherein he gives my	999
	son the whole name of the war: he hath in this	999
	action outdone his former deeds doubly	999
	999
VALERIA	In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his	999
	true purchasing.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	The gods grant them true!	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	True! pow, wow.	999
	999
MENENIUS	True! I'll be sworn they are true.	999
	Where is he wounded?	999
	999
	[To the Tribunes]	999
	999
	God save your good worships! Marcius is coming	999
	home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be	999
	large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall	999
	stand for his place. He received in the repulse of	999
	Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.	999
	999
MENENIUS	One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's	999
	nine that I know.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five	999
	wounds upon him.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.	999
	999
	[A shout and flourish]	999
	999
	Hark! the trumpets.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he	999
	carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:	999
	Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;	999
	Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.	999
	999
	[A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the	999
	general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them, CORIOLANUS,	999
	crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and	999
	Soldiers, and a Herald]	999
	999
Herald	Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight	999
	Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,	999
	With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these	999
	In honour follows Coriolanus.	999
	Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!	999
	999
	[Flourish]	999
	999
All	Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	No more of this; it does offend my heart:	999
	Pray now, no more.	999
	999
COMINIUS	                  Look, sir, your mother!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	O,	999
	You have, I know, petition'd all the gods	999
	For my prosperity!	999
	999
	[Kneels]	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	                  Nay, my good soldier, up;	999
	My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and	999
	By deed-achieving honour newly named,--	999
	What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--	999
	But O, thy wife!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	                  My gracious silence, hail!	999
	Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,	999
	That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,	999
	Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,	999
	And mothers that lack sons.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Now, the gods crown thee!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	And live you yet?	999
	999
	[To VALERIA]	999
	O my sweet lady, pardon.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:	999
	And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.	999
	999
MENENIUS	A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep	999
	And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.	999
	A curse begin at very root on's heart,	999
	That is not glad to see thee! You are three	999
	That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,	999
	We have some old crab-trees here	999
	at home that will not	999
	Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:	999
	We call a nettle but a nettle and	999
	The faults of fools but folly.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Ever right.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Menenius ever, ever.	999
	999
Herald	Give way there, and go on!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	[To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA]  Your hand, and yours:	999
	Ere in our own house I do shade my head,	999
	The good patricians must be visited;	999
	From whom I have received not only greetings,	999
	But with them change of honours.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	I have lived	999
	To see inherited my very wishes	999
	And the buildings of my fancy: only	999
	There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but	999
	Our Rome will cast upon thee.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Know, good mother,	999
	I had rather be their servant in my way,	999
	Than sway with them in theirs.	999
	999
COMINIUS	On, to the Capitol!	999
	999
	[Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before.	999
	BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward]	999
	999
BRUTUS	All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights	999
	Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse	999
	Into a rapture lets her baby cry	999
	While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins	999
	Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,	999
	Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,	999
	Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed	999
	With variable complexions, all agreeing	999
	In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens	999
	Do press among the popular throngs and puff	999
	To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames	999
	Commit the war of white and damask in	999
	Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil	999
	Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother	999
	As if that whatsoever god who leads him	999
	Were slily crept into his human powers	999
	And gave him graceful posture.	999
	999
SICINIUS	On the sudden,	999
	I warrant him consul.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Then our office may,	999
	During his power, go sleep.	999
	999
SICINIUS	He cannot temperately transport his honours	999
	From where he should begin and end, but will	999
	Lose those he hath won.	999
	999
BRUTUS	In that there's comfort.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Doubt not	999
	The commoners, for whom we stand, but they	999
	Upon their ancient malice will forget	999
	With the least cause these his new honours, which	999
	That he will give them make I as little question	999
	As he is proud to do't.	999
	999
BRUTUS	I heard him swear,	999
	Were he to stand for consul, never would he	999
	Appear i' the market-place nor on him put	999
	The napless vesture of humility;	999
	Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds	999
	To the people, beg their stinking breaths.	999
	999
SICINIUS	'Tis right.	999
	999
BRUTUS	It was his word: O, he would miss it rather	999
	Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,	999
	And the desire of the nobles.	999
	999
SICINIUS	I wish no better	999
	Than have him hold that purpose and to put it	999
	In execution.	999
	999
BRUTUS	'Tis most like he will.	999
	999
SICINIUS	It shall be to him then as our good wills,	999
	A sure destruction.	999
	999
BRUTUS	So it must fall out	999
	To him or our authorities. For an end,	999
	We must suggest the people in what hatred	999
	He still hath held them; that to's power he would	999
	Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and	999
	Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,	999
	In human action and capacity,	999
	Of no more soul nor fitness for the world	999
	Than camels in the war, who have their provand	999
	Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows	999
	For sinking under them.	999
	999
SICINIUS	This, as you say, suggested	999
	At some time when his soaring insolence	999
	Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,	999
	If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy	999
	As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire	999
	To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze	999
	Shall darken him for ever.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
BRUTUS	What's the matter?	999
	999
Messenger	You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought	999
	That Marcius shall be consul:	999
	I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and	999
	The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,	999
	Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,	999
	Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,	999
	As to Jove's statue, and the commons made	999
	A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:	999
	I never saw the like.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Let's to the Capitol;	999
	And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,	999
	But hearts for the event.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Have with you.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE  II	The same. The Capitol.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter two Officers, to lay cushions]	999
	999
First Officer	Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand	999
	for consulships?	999
	999
Second Officer	Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one	999
	Coriolanus will carry it.	999
	999
First Officer	That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and	999
	loves not the common people.	999
	999
Second Officer	Faith, there had been many great men that have	999
	flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there	999
	be many that they have loved, they know not	999
	wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,	999
	they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for	999
	Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate	999
	him manifests the true knowledge he has in their	999
	disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets	999
	them plainly see't.	999
	999
First Officer	If he did not care whether he had their love or no,	999
	he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither	999
	good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater	999
	devotion than can render it him; and leaves	999
	nothing undone that may fully discover him their	999
	opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and	999
	displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he	999
	dislikes, to flatter them for their love.	999
	999
Second Officer	He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his	999
	ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,	999
	having been supple and courteous to the people,	999
	bonneted, without any further deed to have them at	999
	an into their estimation and report: but he hath so	999
	planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions	999
	in their hearts, that for their tongues to be	999
	silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of	999
	ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a	999
	malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck	999
	reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.	999
	999
First Officer	No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they	999
	are coming.	999
	999
	[A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS	999
	the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators,	999
	SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their	999
	places; the Tribunes take their Places by	999
	themselves. CORIOLANUS stands]	999
	999
MENENIUS	Having determined of the Volsces and	999
	To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,	999
	As the main point of this our after-meeting,	999
	To gratify his noble service that	999
	Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,	999
	please you,	999
	Most reverend and grave elders, to desire	999
	The present consul, and last general	999
	In our well-found successes, to report	999
	A little of that worthy work perform'd	999
	By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom	999
	We met here both to thank and to remember	999
	With honours like himself.	999
	999
First Senator	Speak, good Cominius:	999
	Leave nothing out for length, and make us think	999
	Rather our state's defective for requital	999
	Than we to stretch it out.	999
	999
	[To the Tribunes]	999
	999
		     Masters o' the people,	999
	We do request your kindest ears, and after,	999
	Your loving motion toward the common body,	999
	To yield what passes here.	999
	999
SICINIUS	We are convented	999
	Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts	999
	Inclinable to honour and advance	999
	The theme of our assembly.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Which the rather	999
	We shall be blest to do, if he remember	999
	A kinder value of the people than	999
	He hath hereto prized them at.	999
	999
MENENIUS	That's off, that's off;	999
	I would you rather had been silent. Please you	999
	To hear Cominius speak?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Most willingly;	999
	But yet my caution was more pertinent	999
	Than the rebuke you give it.	999
	999
MENENIUS	He loves your people	999
	But tie him not to be their bedfellow.	999
	Worthy Cominius, speak.	999
	999
	[CORIOLANUS offers to go away]	999
	999
		  Nay, keep your place.	999
	999
First Senator	Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear	999
	What you have nobly done.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Your horror's pardon:	999
	I had rather have my wounds to heal again	999
	Than hear say how I got them.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Sir, I hope	999
	My words disbench'd you not.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	No, sir: yet oft,	999
	When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.	999
	You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but	999
	your people,	999
	I love them as they weigh.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Pray now, sit down.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun	999
	When the alarum were struck than idly sit	999
	To hear my nothings monster'd.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
MENENIUS	Masters of the people,	999
	Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--	999
	That's thousand to one good one--when you now see	999
	He had rather venture all his limbs for honour	999
	Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.	999
	999
COMINIUS	I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus	999
	Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held	999
	That valour is the chiefest virtue, and	999
	Most dignifies the haver: if it be,	999
	The man I speak of cannot in the world	999
	Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,	999
	When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought	999
	Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,	999
	Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,	999
	When with his Amazonian chin he drove	999
	The bristled lips before him: be bestrid	999
	An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view	999
	Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,	999
	And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,	999
	When he might act the woman in the scene,	999
	He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed	999
	Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age	999
	Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,	999
	And in the brunt of seventeen battles since	999
	He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,	999
	Before and in Corioli, let me say,	999
	I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;	999
	And by his rare example made the coward	999
	Turn terror into sport: as weeds before	999
	A vessel under sail, so men obey'd	999
	And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,	999
	Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot	999
	He was a thing of blood, whose every motion	999
	Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd	999
	The mortal gate of the city, which he painted	999
	With shunless destiny; aidless came off,	999
	And with a sudden reinforcement struck	999
	Corioli like a planet: now all's his:	999
	When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce	999
	His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit	999
	Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,	999
	And to the battle came he; where he did	999
	Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if	999
	'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd	999
	Both field and city ours, he never stood	999
	To ease his breast with panting.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Worthy man!	999
	999
First Senator	He cannot but with measure fit the honours	999
	Which we devise him.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Our spoils he kick'd at,	999
	And look'd upon things precious as they were	999
	The common muck of the world: he covets less	999
	Than misery itself would give; rewards	999
	His deeds with doing them, and is content	999
	To spend the time to end it.	999
	999
MENENIUS	He's right noble:	999
	Let him be call'd for.	999
	999
First Senator	Call Coriolanus.	999
	999
Officer	He doth appear.	999
	999
	[Re-enter CORIOLANUS]	999
	999
MENENIUS	The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased	999
	To make thee consul.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I do owe them still	999
	My life and services.	999
	999
MENENIUS	It then remains	999
	That you do speak to the people.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I do beseech you,	999
	Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot	999
	Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,	999
	For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you	999
	That I may pass this doing.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Sir, the people	999
	Must have their voices; neither will they bate	999
	One jot of ceremony.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Put them not to't:	999
	Pray you, go fit you to the custom and	999
	Take to you, as your predecessors have,	999
	Your honour with your form.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	It is apart	999
	That I shall blush in acting, and might well	999
	Be taken from the people.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Mark you that?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;	999
	Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,	999
	As if I had received them for the hire	999
	Of their breath only!	999
	999
MENENIUS	Do not stand upon't.	999
	We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,	999
	Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul	999
	Wish we all joy and honour.	999
	999
Senators	To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!	999
	999
	[Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS	999
	and BRUTUS]	999
	999
BRUTUS	You see how he intends to use the people.	999
	999
SICINIUS	May they perceive's intent! He will require them,	999
	As if he did contemn what he requested	999
	Should be in them to give.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Come, we'll inform them	999
	Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,	999
	I know, they do attend us.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	999
	999
	999
	CORIOLANUS	999
	999
	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	The same. The Forum.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter seven or eight Citizens]	999
	999
First Citizen	Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.	999
	999
Second Citizen	We may, sir, if we will.	999
	999
Third Citizen	We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a	999
	power that we have no power to do; for if he show us	999
	his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our	999
	tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if	999
	he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him	999
	our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is	999
	monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,	999
	were to make a monster of the multitude: of the	999
	which we being members, should bring ourselves to be	999
	monstrous members.	999
	999
First Citizen	And to make us no better thought of, a little help	999
	will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he	999
	himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.	999
	999
Third Citizen	We have been called so of many; not that our heads	999
	are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,	999
	but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and	999
	truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of	999
	one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,	999
	and their consent of one direct way should be at	999
	once to all the points o' the compass.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would	999
	fly?	999
	999
Third Citizen	Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's	999
	will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but	999
	if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Why that way?	999
	999
Third Citizen	To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts	999
	melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return	999
	for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.	999
	999
Second Citizen	You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Are you all resolved to give your voices? But	999
	that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I	999
	say, if he would incline to the people, there was	999
	never a worthier man.	999
	999
	[Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility,	999
	with MENENIUS]	999
	999
	Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his	999
	behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to	999
	come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and	999
	by threes. He's to make his requests by	999
	particulars; wherein every one of us has a single	999
	honour, in giving him our own voices with our own	999
	tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how	999
	you shall go by him.	999
	999
All	Content, content.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Citizens]	999
	999
MENENIUS	O sir, you are not right: have you not known	999
	The worthiest men have done't?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	What must I say?	999
	'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring	999
	My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!	999
	I got them in my country's service, when	999
	Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran	999
	From the noise of our own drums.'	999
	999
MENENIUS	O me, the gods!	999
	You must not speak of that: you must desire them	999
	To think upon you.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	                  Think upon me! hang 'em!	999
	I would they would forget me, like the virtues	999
	Which our divines lose by 'em.	999
	999
MENENIUS	You'll mar all:	999
	I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,	999
	In wholesome manner.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Bid them wash their faces	999
	And keep their teeth clean.	999
	999
	[Re-enter two of the Citizens]	999
	999
		      So, here comes a brace.	999
	999
	[Re-enter a third Citizen]	999
	999
	You know the cause, air, of my standing here.	999
	999
Third Citizen	We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Mine own desert.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Your own desert!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Ay, but not mine own desire.	999
	999
Third Citizen	How not your own desire?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the	999
	poor with begging.	999
	999
Third Citizen	You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to	999
	gain by you.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?	999
	999
First Citizen	The price is to ask it kindly.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to	999
	show you, which shall be yours in private. Your	999
	good voice, sir; what say you?	999
	999
Second Citizen	You shall ha' it, worthy sir.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices	999
	begged. I have your alms: adieu.	999
	999
Third Citizen	But this is something odd.	999
	999
Second Citizen	An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.	999
	999
	[Exeunt the three Citizens]	999
	999
	[Re-enter two other Citizens]	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your	999
	voices that I may be consul, I have here the	999
	customary gown.	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	You have deserved nobly of your country, and you	999
	have not deserved nobly.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Your enigma?	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have	999
	been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved	999
	the common people.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	You should account me the more virtuous that I have	999
	not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my	999
	sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer	999
	estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account	999
	gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is	999
	rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise	999
	the insinuating nod and be off to them most	999
	counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the	999
	bewitchment of some popular man and give it	999
	bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,	999
	I may be consul.	999
	999
Fifth Citizen	We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give	999
	you our voices heartily.	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	You have received many wounds for your country.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I	999
	will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.	999
	999
Both Citizens	The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Most sweet voices!	999
	Better it is to die, better to starve,	999
	Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.	999
	Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,	999
	To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,	999
	Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:	999
	What custom wills, in all things should we do't,	999
	The dust on antique time would lie unswept,	999
	And mountainous error be too highly heapt	999
	For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,	999
	Let the high office and the honour go	999
	To one that would do thus. I am half through;	999
	The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.	999
	999
	[Re-enter three Citizens more]	999
	999
	Here come more voices.	999
	Your voices: for your voices I have fought;	999
	Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear	999
	Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six	999
	I have seen and heard of; for your voices have	999
	Done many things, some less, some more your voices:	999
	Indeed I would be consul.	999
	999
Sixth Citizen	He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest	999
	man's voice.	999
	999
Seventh Citizen	Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,	999
	and make him good friend to the people!	999
	999
All Citizens	Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Worthy voices!	999
	999
	[Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS]	999
	999
MENENIUS	You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes	999
	Endue you with the people's voice: remains	999
	That, in the official marks invested, you	999
	Anon do meet the senate.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Is this done?	999
	999
SICINIUS	The custom of request you have discharged:	999
	The people do admit you, and are summon'd	999
	To meet anon, upon your approbation.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Where? at the senate-house?	999
	999
SICINIUS	There, Coriolanus.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	May I change these garments?	999
	999
SICINIUS	You may, sir.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,	999
	Repair to the senate-house.	999
	999
MENENIUS	I'll keep you company. Will you along?	999
	999
BRUTUS	We stay here for the people.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Fare you well.	999
	999
	[Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS]	999
	999
	He has it now, and by his looks methink	999
	'Tis warm at 's heart.	999
	999
BRUTUS	With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.	999
	will you dismiss the people?	999
	999
	[Re-enter Citizens]	999
	999
SICINIUS	How now, my masters! have you chose this man?	999
	999
First Citizen	He has our voices, sir.	999
	999
BRUTUS	We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,	999
	He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Certainly	999
	He flouted us downright.	999
	999
First Citizen	No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says	999
	He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us	999
	His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Why, so he did, I am sure.	999
	999
Citizens	No, no; no man saw 'em.	999
	999
Third Citizen	He said he had wounds, which he could show	999
	in private;	999
	And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,	999
	'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,	999
	But by your voices, will not so permit me;	999
	Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,	999
	Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:	999
	Your most sweet voices: now you have left	999
	your voices,	999
	I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?	999
	999
SICINIUS	Why either were you ignorant to see't,	999
	Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness	999
	To yield your voices?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Could you not have told him	999
	As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,	999
	But was a petty servant to the state,	999
	He was your enemy, ever spake against	999
	Your liberties and the charters that you bear	999
	I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving	999
	A place of potency and sway o' the state,	999
	If he should still malignantly remain	999
	Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might	999
	Be curses to yourselves? You should have said	999
	That as his worthy deeds did claim no less	999
	Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature	999
	Would think upon you for your voices and	999
	Translate his malice towards you into love,	999
	Standing your friendly lord.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Thus to have said,	999
	As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit	999
	And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd	999
	Either his gracious promise, which you might,	999
	As cause had call'd you up, have held him to	999
	Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,	999
	Which easily endures not article	999
	Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,	999
	You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler	999
	And pass'd him unelected.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Did you perceive	999
	He did solicit you in free contempt	999
	When he did need your loves, and do you think	999
	That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,	999
	When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies	999
	No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry	999
	Against the rectorship of judgment?	999
	999
SICINIUS	Have you	999
	Ere now denied the asker? and now again	999
	Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow	999
	Your sued-for tongues?	999
	999
Third Citizen	He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.	999
	999
Second Citizen	And will deny him:	999
	I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.	999
	999
First Citizen	I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,	999
	They have chose a consul that will from them take	999
	Their liberties; make them of no more voice	999
	Than dogs that are as often beat for barking	999
	As therefore kept to do so.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Let them assemble,	999
	And on a safer judgment all revoke	999
	Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,	999
	And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not	999
	With what contempt he wore the humble weed,	999
	How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,	999
	Thinking upon his services, took from you	999
	The apprehension of his present portance,	999
	Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion	999
	After the inveterate hate he bears you.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Lay	999
	A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,	999
	No impediment between, but that you must	999
	Cast your election on him.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Say, you chose him	999
	More after our commandment than as guided	999
	By your own true affections, and that your minds,	999
	Preoccupied with what you rather must do	999
	Than what you should, made you against the grain	999
	To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.	999
	How youngly he began to serve his country,	999
	How long continued, and what stock he springs of,	999
	The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came	999
	That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,	999
	Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;	999
	Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,	999
	That our beat water brought by conduits hither;	999
	And  [Censorinus,]  nobly named so,	999
	Twice being  [by the people chosen]  censor,	999
	Was his great ancestor.	999
	999
SICINIUS	One thus descended,	999
	That hath beside well in his person wrought	999
	To be set high in place, we did commend	999
	To your remembrances: but you have found,	999
	Scaling his present bearing with his past,	999
	That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke	999
	Your sudden approbation.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Say, you ne'er had done't--	999
	Harp on that still--but by our putting on;	999
	And presently, when you have drawn your number,	999
	Repair to the Capitol.	999
	999
All	We will so: almost all	999
	Repent in their election.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Citizens]	999
	999
BRUTUS	Let them go on;	999
	This mutiny were better put in hazard,	999
	Than stay, past doubt, for greater:	999
	If, as his nature is, he fall in rage	999
	With their refusal, both observe and answer	999
	The vantage of his anger.	999
	999
SICINIUS	To the Capitol, come:	999
	We will be there before the stream o' the people;	999
	And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,	999
	Which we have goaded onward.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Rome. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the	999
	Gentry, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators]	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?	999
	999
LARTIUS	He had, my lord; and that it was which caused	999
	Our swifter composition.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	So then the Volsces stand but as at first,	999
	Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.	999
	Upon's again.	999
	999
COMINIUS	They are worn, lord consul, so,	999
	That we shall hardly in our ages see	999
	Their banners wave again.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Saw you Aufidius?	999
	999
LARTIUS	On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse	999
	Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely	999
	Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Spoke he of me?	999
	999
LARTIUS	                  He did, my lord.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	How? what?	999
	999
LARTIUS	How often he had met you, sword to sword;	999
	That of all things upon the earth he hated	999
	Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes	999
	To hopeless restitution, so he might	999
	Be call'd your vanquisher.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	At Antium lives he?	999
	999
LARTIUS	At Antium.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I wish I had a cause to seek him there,	999
	To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.	999
	999
	[Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS]	999
	999
	Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,	999
	The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;	999
	For they do prank them in authority,	999
	Against all noble sufferance.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Pass no further.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Ha! what is that?	999
	999
BRUTUS	It will be dangerous to go on: no further.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	What makes this change?	999
	999
MENENIUS	The matter?	999
	999
COMINIUS	Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Cominius, no.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	                  Have I had children's voices?	999
	999
First Senator	Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.	999
	999
BRUTUS	The people are incensed against him.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Stop,	999
	Or all will fall in broil.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Are these your herd?	999
	Must these have voices, that can yield them now	999
	And straight disclaim their tongues? What are	999
	your offices?	999
	You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?	999
	Have you not set them on?	999
	999
MENENIUS	Be calm, be calm.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,	999
	To curb the will of the nobility:	999
	Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule	999
	Nor ever will be ruled.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Call't not a plot:	999
	The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,	999
	When corn was given them gratis, you repined;	999
	Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them	999
	Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Why, this was known before.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Not to them all.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Have you inform'd them sithence?	999
	999
BRUTUS	How! I inform them!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	You are like to do such business.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Not unlike,	999
	Each way, to better yours.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,	999
	Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me	999
	Your fellow tribune.	999
	999
SICINIUS	You show too much of that	999
	For which the people stir: if you will pass	999
	To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,	999
	Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,	999
	Or never be so noble as a consul,	999
	Nor yoke with him for tribune.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Let's be calm.	999
	999
COMINIUS	The people are abused; set on. This paltering	999
	Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus	999
	Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely	999
	I' the plain way of his merit.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Tell me of corn!	999
	This was my speech, and I will speak't again--	999
	999
MENENIUS	Not now, not now.	999
	999
First Senator	                  Not in this heat, sir, now.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,	999
	I crave their pardons:	999
	For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them	999
	Regard me as I do not flatter, and	999
	Therein behold themselves: I say again,	999
	In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate	999
	The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,	999
	Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,	999
	and scatter'd,	999
	By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,	999
	Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that	999
	Which they have given to beggars.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Well, no more.	999
	999
First Senator	No more words, we beseech you.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	How! no more!	999
	As for my country I have shed my blood,	999
	Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs	999
	Coin words till their decay against those measles,	999
	Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought	999
	The very way to catch them.	999
	999
BRUTUS	You speak o' the people,	999
	As if you were a god to punish, not	999
	A man of their infirmity.	999
	999
SICINIUS	'Twere well	999
	We let the people know't.	999
	999
MENENIUS	What, what? his choler?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Choler!	999
	Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,	999
	By Jove, 'twould be my mind!	999
	999
SICINIUS	It is a mind	999
	That shall remain a poison where it is,	999
	Not poison any further.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Shall remain!	999
	Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you	999
	His absolute 'shall'?	999
	999
COMINIUS	'Twas from the canon.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	'Shall'!	999
	O good but most unwise patricians! why,	999
	You grave but reckless senators, have you thus	999
	Given Hydra here to choose an officer,	999
	That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but	999
	The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit	999
	To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,	999
	And make your channel his? If he have power	999
	Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake	999
	Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,	999
	Be not as common fools; if you are not,	999
	Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,	999
	If they be senators: and they are no less,	999
	When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste	999
	Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,	999
	And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'	999
	His popular 'shall' against a graver bench	999
	Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!	999
	It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches	999
	To know, when two authorities are up,	999
	Neither supreme, how soon confusion	999
	May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take	999
	The one by the other.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Well, on to the market-place.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth	999
	The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used	999
	Sometime in Greece,--	999
	999
MENENIUS	Well, well, no more of that.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Though there the people had more absolute power,	999
	I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed	999
	The ruin of the state.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Why, shall the people give	999
	One that speaks thus their voice?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I'll give my reasons,	999
	More worthier than their voices. They know the corn	999
	Was not our recompense, resting well assured	999
	That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,	999
	Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,	999
	They would not thread the gates. This kind of service	999
	Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war	999
	Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd	999
	Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation	999
	Which they have often made against the senate,	999
	All cause unborn, could never be the motive	999
	Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?	999
	How shall this bisson multitude digest	999
	The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express	999
	What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;	999
	We are the greater poll, and in true fear	999
	They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase	999
	The nature of our seats and make the rabble	999
	Call our cares fears; which will in time	999
	Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in	999
	The crows to peck the eagles.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Come, enough.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Enough, with over-measure.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	No, take more:	999
	What may be sworn by, both divine and human,	999
	Seal what I end withal! This double worship,	999
	Where one part does disdain with cause, the other	999
	Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,	999
	Cannot conclude but by the yea and no	999
	Of general ignorance,--it must omit	999
	Real necessities, and give way the while	999
	To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,	999
	it follows,	999
	Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--	999
	You that will be less fearful than discreet,	999
	That love the fundamental part of state	999
	More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer	999
	A noble life before a long, and wish	999
	To jump a body with a dangerous physic	999
	That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out	999
	The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick	999
	The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour	999
	Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state	999
	Of that integrity which should become't,	999
	Not having the power to do the good it would,	999
	For the in which doth control't.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Has said enough.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer	999
	As traitors do.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	                  Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!	999
	What should the people do with these bald tribunes?	999
	On whom depending, their obedience fails	999
	To the greater bench: in a rebellion,	999
	When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,	999
	Then were they chosen: in a better hour,	999
	Let what is meet be said it must be meet,	999
	And throw their power i' the dust.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Manifest treason!	999
	999
SICINIUS	                  This a consul? no.	999
	999
BRUTUS	The aediles, ho!	999
	999
	[Enter an AEdile]	999
	999
	Let him be apprehended.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Go, call the people:	999
	999
	[Exit AEdile]	999
	999
		in whose name myself	999
	Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,	999
	A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,	999
	And follow to thine answer.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Hence, old goat!	999
	999
Senators, &C	We'll surety him.	999
	999
COMINIUS	                  Aged sir, hands off.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones	999
	Out of thy garments.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Help, ye citizens!	999
	999
	[Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with	999
	the AEdiles]	999
	999
MENENIUS	On both sides more respect.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Here's he that would take from you all your power.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Seize him, AEdiles!	999
	999
Citizens	Down with him! down with him!	999
	999
Senators, &C	Weapons, weapons, weapons!	999
	999
	[They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying]	999
	999
	'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'	999
	'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'	999
	'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'	999
	999
MENENIUS	What is about to be? I am out of breath;	999
	Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes	999
	To the people! Coriolanus, patience!	999
	Speak, good Sicinius.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Hear me, people; peace!	999
	999
Citizens	Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.	999
	999
SICINIUS	You are at point to lose your liberties:	999
	Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,	999
	Whom late you have named for consul.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Fie, fie, fie!	999
	This is the way to kindle, not to quench.	999
	999
First Senator	To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.	999
	999
SICINIUS	What is the city but the people?	999
	999
Citizens	True,	999
	The people are the city.	999
	999
BRUTUS	By the consent of all, we were establish'd	999
	The people's magistrates.	999
	999
Citizens	You so remain.	999
	999
MENENIUS	And so are like to do.	999
	999
COMINIUS	That is the way to lay the city flat;	999
	To bring the roof to the foundation,	999
	And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,	999
	In heaps and piles of ruin.	999
	999
SICINIUS	This deserves death.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Or let us stand to our authority,	999
	Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,	999
	Upon the part o' the people, in whose power	999
	We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy	999
	Of present death.	999
	999
SICINIUS	                  Therefore lay hold of him;	999
	Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence	999
	Into destruction cast him.	999
	999
BRUTUS	AEdiles, seize him!	999
	999
Citizens	Yield, Marcius, yield!	999
	999
MENENIUS	Hear me one word;	999
	Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.	999
	999
AEdile	Peace, peace!	999
	999
MENENIUS	[To BRUTUS]  Be that you seem, truly your	999
	country's friend,	999
	And temperately proceed to what you would	999
	Thus violently redress.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Sir, those cold ways,	999
	That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous	999
	Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,	999
	And bear him to the rock.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	No, I'll die here.	999
	999
	[Drawing his sword]	999
	999
	There's some among you have beheld me fighting:	999
	Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Lay hands upon him.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Help Marcius, help,	999
	You that be noble; help him, young and old!	999
	999
Citizens	Down with him, down with him!	999
	999
	[In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the AEdiles, and the	999
	People, are beat in]	999
	999
MENENIUS	Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!	999
	All will be naught else.	999
	999
Second Senator	Get you gone.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Stand fast;	999
	We have as many friends as enemies.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Sham it be put to that?	999
	999
First Senator	The gods forbid!	999
	I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;	999
	Leave us to cure this cause.	999
	999
MENENIUS	For 'tis a sore upon us,	999
	You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Come, sir, along with us.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I would they were barbarians--as they are,	999
	Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,	999
	Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--	999
	999
MENENIUS	Be gone;	999
	Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;	999
	One time will owe another.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	On fair ground	999
	I could beat forty of them.	999
	999
COMINIUS	I could myself	999
	Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the	999
	two tribunes:	999
	But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;	999
	And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands	999
	Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,	999
	Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend	999
	Like interrupted waters and o'erbear	999
	What they are used to bear.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Pray you, be gone:	999
	I'll try whether my old wit be in request	999
	With those that have but little: this must be patch'd	999
	With cloth of any colour.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Nay, come away.	999
	999
	[Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, and others]	999
	999
A Patrician	This man has marr'd his fortune.	999
	999
MENENIUS	His nature is too noble for the world:	999
	He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,	999
	Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:	999
	What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;	999
	And, being angry, does forget that ever	999
	He heard the name of death.	999
	999
	[A noise within]	999
	999
		      Here's goodly work!	999
	999
Second Patrician	I would they were abed!	999
	999
MENENIUS	I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!	999
	Could he not speak 'em fair?	999
	999
	[Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, with the rabble]	999
	999
SICINIUS	Where is this viper	999
	That would depopulate the city and	999
	Be every man himself?	999
	999
MENENIUS	You worthy tribunes,--	999
	999
SICINIUS	He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock	999
	With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,	999
	And therefore law shall scorn him further trial	999
	Than the severity of the public power	999
	Which he so sets at nought.	999
	999
First Citizen	He shall well know	999
	The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,	999
	And we their hands.	999
	999
Citizens	He shall, sure on't.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Sir, sir,--	999
	999
SICINIUS	Peace!	999
	999
MENENIUS	Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt	999
	With modest warrant.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Sir, how comes't that you	999
	Have holp to make this rescue?	999
	999
MENENIUS	Hear me speak:	999
	As I do know the consul's worthiness,	999
	So can I name his faults,--	999
	999
SICINIUS	Consul! what consul?	999
	999
MENENIUS	The consul Coriolanus.	999
	999
BRUTUS	He consul!	999
	999
Citizens	No, no, no, no, no.	999
	999
MENENIUS	If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,	999
	I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;	999
	The which shall turn you to no further harm	999
	Than so much loss of time.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Speak briefly then;	999
	For we are peremptory to dispatch	999
	This viperous traitor: to eject him hence	999
	Were but one danger, and to keep him here	999
	Our certain death: therefore it is decreed	999
	He dies to-night.	999
	999
MENENIUS	                  Now the good gods forbid	999
	That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude	999
	Towards her deserved children is enroll'd	999
	In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam	999
	Should now eat up her own!	999
	999
SICINIUS	He's a disease that must be cut away.	999
	999
MENENIUS	O, he's a limb that has but a disease;	999
	Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.	999
	What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?	999
	Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--	999
	Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,	999
	By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;	999
	And what is left, to lose it by his country,	999
	Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,	999
	A brand to the end o' the world.	999
	999
SICINIUS	This is clean kam.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Merely awry: when he did love his country,	999
	It honour'd him.	999
	999
MENENIUS	                  The service of the foot	999
	Being once gangrened, is not then respected	999
	For what before it was.	999
	999
BRUTUS	We'll hear no more.	999
	Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:	999
	Lest his infection, being of catching nature,	999
	Spread further.	999
	999
MENENIUS	                  One word more, one word.	999
	This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find	999
	The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late	999
	Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;	999
	Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,	999
	And sack great Rome with Romans.	999
	999
BRUTUS	If it were so,--	999
	999
SICINIUS	What do ye talk?	999
	Have we not had a taste of his obedience?	999
	Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars	999
	Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd	999
	In bolted language; meal and bran together	999
	He throws without distinction. Give me leave,	999
	I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him	999
	Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,	999
	In peace, to his utmost peril.	999
	999
First Senator	Noble tribunes,	999
	It is the humane way: the other course	999
	Will prove too bloody, and the end of it	999
	Unknown to the beginning.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Noble Menenius,	999
	Be you then as the people's officer.	999
	Masters, lay down your weapons.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Go not home.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:	999
	Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed	999
	In our first way.	999
	999
MENENIUS	                  I'll bring him to you.	999
	999
	[To the Senators]	999
	999
	Let me desire your company: he must come,	999
	Or what is worst will follow.	999
	999
First Senator	Pray you, let's to him.	999
	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	A room in CORIOLANUS'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians]	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Let them puff all about mine ears, present me	999
	Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,	999
	Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,	999
	That the precipitation might down stretch	999
	Below the beam of sight, yet will I still	999
	Be thus to them.	999
	999
A Patrician	You do the nobler.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I muse my mother	999
	Does not approve me further, who was wont	999
	To call them woollen vassals, things created	999
	To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads	999
	In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,	999
	When one but of my ordinance stood up	999
	To speak of peace or war.	999
	999
	[Enter VOLUMNIA]	999
	999
		    I talk of you:	999
	Why did you wish me milder? would you have me	999
	False to my nature? Rather say I play	999
	The man I am.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	                  O, sir, sir, sir,	999
	I would have had you put your power well on,	999
	Before you had worn it out.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Let go.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	You might have been enough the man you are,	999
	With striving less to be so; lesser had been	999
	The thwartings of your dispositions, if	999
	You had not show'd them how ye were disposed	999
	Ere they lack'd power to cross you.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Let them hang.	999
	999
A Patrician	Ay, and burn too.	999
	999
	[Enter MENENIUS and Senators]	999
	999
MENENIUS	Come, come, you have been too rough, something	999
	too rough;	999
	You must return and mend it.	999
	999
First Senator	There's no remedy;	999
	Unless, by not so doing, our good city	999
	Cleave in the midst, and perish.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Pray, be counsell'd:	999
	I have a heart as little apt as yours,	999
	But yet a brain that leads my use of anger	999
	To better vantage.	999
	999
MENENIUS	                  Well said, noble woman?	999
	Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that	999
	The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic	999
	For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,	999
	Which I can scarcely bear.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	What must I do?	999
	999
MENENIUS	Return to the tribunes.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Well, what then? what then?	999
	999
MENENIUS	Repent what you have spoke.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	For them! I cannot do it to the gods;	999
	Must I then do't to them?	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	You are too absolute;	999
	Though therein you can never be too noble,	999
	But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,	999
	Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,	999
	I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,	999
	In peace what each of them by the other lose,	999
	That they combine not there.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Tush, tush!	999
	999
MENENIUS	A good demand.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	If it be honour in your wars to seem	999
	The same you are not, which, for your best ends,	999
	You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,	999
	That it shall hold companionship in peace	999
	With honour, as in war, since that to both	999
	It stands in like request?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Why force you this?	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Because that now it lies you on to speak	999
	To the people; not by your own instruction,	999
	Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,	999
	But with such words that are but rooted in	999
	Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables	999
	Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.	999
	Now, this no more dishonours you at all	999
	Than to take in a town with gentle words,	999
	Which else would put you to your fortune and	999
	The hazard of much blood.	999
	I would dissemble with my nature where	999
	My fortunes and my friends at stake required	999
	I should do so in honour: I am in this,	999
	Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;	999
	And you will rather show our general louts	999
	How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,	999
	For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard	999
	Of what that want might ruin.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Noble lady!	999
	Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,	999
	Not what is dangerous present, but the loss	999
	Of what is past.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	                  I prithee now, my son,	999
	Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;	999
	And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--	999
	Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business	999
	Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant	999
	More learned than the ears--waving thy head,	999
	Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,	999
	Now humble as the ripest mulberry	999
	That will not hold the handling: or say to them,	999
	Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils	999
	Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,	999
	Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,	999
	In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame	999
	Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far	999
	As thou hast power and person.	999
	999
MENENIUS	This but done,	999
	Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;	999
	For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free	999
	As words to little purpose.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Prithee now,	999
	Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather	999
	Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf	999
	Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.	999
	999
	[Enter COMINIUS]	999
	999
COMINIUS	I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit	999
	You make strong party, or defend yourself	999
	By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Only fair speech.	999
	999
COMINIUS	                  I think 'twill serve, if he	999
	Can thereto frame his spirit.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	He must, and will	999
	Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?	999
	Must I with base tongue give my noble heart	999
	A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:	999
	Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,	999
	This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it	999
	And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!	999
	You have put me now to such a part which never	999
	I shall discharge to the life.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Come, come, we'll prompt you.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said	999
	My praises made thee first a soldier, so,	999
	To have my praise for this, perform a part	999
	Thou hast not done before.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Well, I must do't:	999
	Away, my disposition, and possess me	999
	Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,	999
	Which quired with my drum, into a pipe	999
	Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice	999
	That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves	999
	Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up	999
	The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue	999
	Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,	999
	Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his	999
	That hath received an alms! I will not do't,	999
	Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth	999
	And by my body's action teach my mind	999
	A most inherent baseness.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	At thy choice, then:	999
	To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour	999
	Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let	999
	Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear	999
	Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death	999
	With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list	999
	Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,	999
	But owe thy pride thyself.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Pray, be content:	999
	Mother, I am going to the market-place;	999
	Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,	999
	Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved	999
	Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:	999
	Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;	999
	Or never trust to what my tongue can do	999
	I' the way of flattery further.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Do your will.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
COMINIUS	Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself	999
	To answer mildly; for they are prepared	999
	With accusations, as I hear, more strong	999
	Than are upon you yet.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:	999
	Let them accuse me by invention, I	999
	Will answer in mine honour.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Ay, but mildly.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!	999
	999

ACT III	999

	999
	999
SCENE III	The same. The Forum.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS]	999
	999
BRUTUS	In this point charge him home, that he affects	999
	Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,	999
	Enforce him with his envy to the people,	999
	And that the spoil got on the Antiates	999
	Was ne'er distributed.	999
	999
	[Enter an AEdile]	999
	999
	What, will he come?	999
	999
AEdile	He's coming.	999
	999
BRUTUS	How accompanied?	999
	999
AEdile	With old Menenius, and those senators	999
	That always favour'd him.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Have you a catalogue	999
	Of all the voices that we have procured	999
	Set down by the poll?	999
	999
AEdile	I have; 'tis ready.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Have you collected them by tribes?	999
	999
AEdile	I have.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Assemble presently the people hither;	999
	And when they bear me say 'It shall be so	999
	I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either	999
	For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them	999
	If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'	999
	Insisting on the old prerogative	999
	And power i' the truth o' the cause.	999
	999
AEdile	I shall inform them.	999
	999
BRUTUS	And when such time they have begun to cry,	999
	Let them not cease, but with a din confused	999
	Enforce the present execution	999
	Of what we chance to sentence.	999
	999
AEdile	Very well.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Make them be strong and ready for this hint,	999
	When we shall hap to give 't them.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Go about it.	999
	999
	[Exit AEdile]	999
	999
	Put him to choler straight: he hath been used	999
	Ever to conquer, and to have his worth	999
	Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot	999
	Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks	999
	What's in his heart; and that is there which looks	999
	With us to break his neck.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Well, here he comes.	999
	999
	[Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, and COMINIUS,	999
	with Senators and Patricians]	999
	999
MENENIUS	Calmly, I do beseech you.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece	999
	Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods	999
	Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice	999
	Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!	999
	Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,	999
	And not our streets with war!	999
	999
First Senator	Amen, amen.	999
	999
MENENIUS	A noble wish.	999
	999
	[Re-enter AEdile, with Citizens]	999
	999
SICINIUS	Draw near, ye people.	999
	999
AEdile	List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	First, hear me speak.	999
	999
Both Tribunes	Well, say. Peace, ho!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Shall I be charged no further than this present?	999
	Must all determine here?	999
	999
SICINIUS	I do demand,	999
	If you submit you to the people's voices,	999
	Allow their officers and are content	999
	To suffer lawful censure for such faults	999
	As shall be proved upon you?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I am content.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Lo, citizens, he says he is content:	999
	The warlike service he has done, consider; think	999
	Upon the wounds his body bears, which show	999
	Like graves i' the holy churchyard.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Scratches with briers,	999
	Scars to move laughter only.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Consider further,	999
	That when he speaks not like a citizen,	999
	You find him like a soldier: do not take	999
	His rougher accents for malicious sounds,	999
	But, as I say, such as become a soldier,	999
	Rather than envy you.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Well, well, no more.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	What is the matter	999
	That being pass'd for consul with full voice,	999
	I am so dishonour'd that the very hour	999
	You take it off again?	999
	999
SICINIUS	Answer to us.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.	999
	999
SICINIUS	We charge you, that you have contrived to take	999
	From Rome all season'd office and to wind	999
	Yourself into a power tyrannical;	999
	For which you are a traitor to the people.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	How! traitor!	999
	999
MENENIUS	                  Nay, temperately; your promise.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!	999
	Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!	999
	Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,	999
	In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in	999
	Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say	999
	'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free	999
	As I do pray the gods.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Mark you this, people?	999
	999
Citizens	To the rock, to the rock with him!	999
	999
SICINIUS	Peace!	999
	We need not put new matter to his charge:	999
	What you have seen him do and heard him speak,	999
	Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,	999
	Opposing laws with strokes and here defying	999
	Those whose great power must try him; even this,	999
	So criminal and in such capital kind,	999
	Deserves the extremest death.	999
	999
BRUTUS	But since he hath	999
	Served well for Rome,--	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	What do you prate of service?	999
	999
BRUTUS	I talk of that, that know it.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	You?	999
	999
MENENIUS	Is this the promise that you made your mother?	999
	999
COMINIUS	Know, I pray you,--	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I know no further:	999
	Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,	999
	Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger	999
	But with a grain a day, I would not buy	999
	Their mercy at the price of one fair word;	999
	Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,	999
	To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'	999
	999
SICINIUS	For that he has,	999
	As much as in him lies, from time to time	999
	Envied against the people, seeking means	999
	To pluck away their power, as now at last	999
	Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence	999
	Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers	999
	That do distribute it; in the name o' the people	999
	And in the power of us the tribunes, we,	999
	Even from this instant, banish him our city,	999
	In peril of precipitation	999
	From off the rock Tarpeian never more	999
	To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,	999
	I say it shall be so.	999
	999
Citizens	It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:	999
	He's banish'd, and it shall be so.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--	999
	999
SICINIUS	He's sentenced; no more hearing.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Let me speak:	999
	I have been consul, and can show for Rome	999
	Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love	999
	My country's good with a respect more tender,	999
	More holy and profound, than mine own life,	999
	My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,	999
	And treasure of my loins; then if I would	999
	Speak that,--	999
	999
SICINIUS	                  We know your drift: speak what?	999
	999
BRUTUS	There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,	999
	As enemy to the people and his country:	999
	It shall be so.	999
	999
Citizens	It shall be so, it shall be so.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate	999
	As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize	999
	As the dead carcasses of unburied men	999
	That do corrupt my air, I banish you;	999
	And here remain with your uncertainty!	999
	Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!	999
	Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,	999
	Fan you into despair! Have the power still	999
	To banish your defenders; till at length	999
	Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,	999
	Making not reservation of yourselves,	999
	Still your own foes, deliver you as most	999
	Abated captives to some nation	999
	That won you without blows! Despising,	999
	For you, the city, thus I turn my back:	999
	There is a world elsewhere.	999

Citizens	Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!	999
	999
	[Shouting, and throwing up their caps]	999
	999
SICINIUS	Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,	999
	As he hath followed you, with all despite;	999
	Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard	999
	Attend us through the city.	999
	999

	[Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS,	999
	COMINIUS, with the young Nobility of Rome]	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast	999
	With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,	999
	Where is your ancient courage? you were used	999
	To say extremity was the trier of spirits;	999
	That common chances common men could bear;	999
	That when the sea was calm all boats alike	999
	Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,	999
	When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves	999
	A noble cunning: you were used to load me	999
	With precepts that would make invincible	999
	The heart that conn'd them.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	O heavens! O heavens!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Nay! prithee, woman,--	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,	999
	And occupations perish!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	What, what, what!	999
	I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.	999
	Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,	999
	If you had been the wife of Hercules,	999
	Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved	999
	Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,	999
	Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:	999
	I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,	999
	Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,	999
	And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,	999
	I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld	999
	Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women	999
	'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,	999
	As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well	999
	My hazards still have been your solace: and	999
	Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,	999
	Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen	999
	Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son	999
	Will or exceed the common or be caught	999
	With cautelous baits and practise.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	My first son.	999
	Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius	999
	With thee awhile: determine on some course,	999
	More than a wild exposture to each chance	999
	That starts i' the way before thee.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	O the gods!	999
	999
COMINIUS	I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee	999
	Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us	999
	And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth	999
	A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send	999
	O'er the vast world to seek a single man,	999
	And lose advantage, which doth ever cool	999
	I' the absence of the needer.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Fare ye well:	999
	Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full	999
	Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one	999
	That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.	999
	Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and	999
	My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,	999
	Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.	999
	While I remain above the ground, you shall	999
	Hear from me still, and never of me aught	999
	But what is like me formerly.	999
	999
MENENIUS	That's worthily	999
	As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.	999
	If I could shake off but one seven years	999
	From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,	999
	I'ld with thee every foot.	999

	[Enter SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and an AEdile]	999
	999
SICINIUS	Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.	999
	The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided	999
	In his behalf.	999
	999
BRUTUS	                  Now we have shown our power,	999
	Let us seem humbler after it is done	999
	Than when it was a-doing.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Bid them home:	999
	Say their great enemy is gone, and they	999

	999
BRUTUS	Dismiss them home.	999
	999

BRUTUS	Why?	999

SICINIUS	They say she's mad.	999

BRUTUS	They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.	999

	[Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS]	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods	999
	Requite your love!	999
	999
MENENIUS	                  Peace, peace; be not so loud.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--	999
	Nay, and you shall hear some.	999
	999
	[To BRUTUS]	999
	999
		        Will you be gone?	999
	999
VIRGILIA	[To SICINIUS]  You shall stay too: I would I had the power	999
	To say so to my husband.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Are you mankind?	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.	999
	Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship	999
	To banish him that struck more blows for Rome	999
	Than thou hast spoken words?	999
	999
SICINIUS	O blessed heavens!	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	More noble blows than ever thou wise words;	999
	And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:	999
	Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son	999
	Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,	999
	His good sword in his hand.	999
	999
SICINIUS	What then?	999
	999
VIRGILIA	What then!	999
	He'ld make an end of thy posterity.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Bastards and all.	999
	Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!	999
	999
MENENIUS	Come, come, peace.	999
	999
SICINIUS	I would he had continued to his country	999
	As he began, and not unknit himself	999
	The noble knot he made.	999
	999
BRUTUS	I would he had.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:	999
	Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth	999
	As I can of those mysteries which heaven	999
	Will not have earth to know.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Pray, let us go.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Now, pray, sir, get you gone:	999
	You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--	999
	As far as doth the Capitol exceed	999
	The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--	999
	This lady's husband here, this, do you see--	999
	Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Well, well, we'll leave you.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Why stay we to be baited	999
	With one that wants her wits?	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Take my prayers with you.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Tribunes]	999
	999
	I would the gods had nothing else to do	999
	But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em	999
	But once a-day, it would unclog my heart	999
	Of what lies heavy to't.	999
	999
MENENIUS	You have told them home;	999
	And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,	999
	And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:	999
	Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,	999
	In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.	999

	999
	[Enter a Roman and a Volsce, meeting]	999
	999
Roman	I know you well, sir, and you know	999
	me: your name, I think, is Adrian.	999
	999
Volsce	It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.	999
	999
Roman	I am a Roman; and my services are,	999
	as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?	999
	999
Volsce	Nicanor? no.	999
	999
Roman	The same, sir.	999
	999
Volsce	You had more beard when I last saw you; but your	999
	favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the	999
	news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,	999
	to find you out there: you have well saved me a	999
	day's journey.	999
	999
Roman	There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the	999
	people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.	999
	999
Volsce	Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not	999
	so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and	999
	hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.	999
	999
Roman	The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing	999
	would make it flame again: for the nobles receive	999
	so to heart the banishment of that worthy	999
	Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take	999
	all power from the people and to pluck from them	999
	their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can	999
	tell you, and is almost mature for the violent	999
	breaking out.	999
	999
Volsce	Coriolanus banished!	999
	999
Roman	Banished, sir.	999
	999
Volsce	You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.	999
	999
Roman	The day serves well for them now. I have heard it	999
	said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is	999
	when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble	999
	Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his	999
	great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request	999
	of his country.	999
	999
Volsce	He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus	999
	accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my	999
	business, and I will merrily accompany you home.	999
	999
Roman	I shall, between this and supper, tell you most	999
	strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of	999
	their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?	999
	999
Volsce	A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,	999
	distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,	999
	and to be on foot at an hour's warning.	999
	999
Roman	I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the	999
	man, I think, that shall set them in present action.	999
	So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.	999
	999
Volsce	You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause	999
	to be glad of yours.	999
	999
Roman	Well, let us go together.	999

CORIOLANUS	A goodly city is this Antium. City,	999
	'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir	999
	Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars	999
	Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,	999
	Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones	999
	In puny battle slay me.	999
	999
	[Enter a Citizen]	999
	999
		  Save you, sir.	999
	999
Citizen	And you.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	       Direct me, if it be your will,	999
	Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?	999
	999
Citizen	He is, and feasts the nobles of the state	999
	At his house this night.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Which is his house, beseech you?	999
	999
Citizen	This, here before you.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Thank you, sir: farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit Citizen]	999
	999
	O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,	999
	Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,	999
	Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,	999
	Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love	999
	Unseparable, shall within this hour,	999
	On a dissension of a doit, break out	999
	To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,	999
	Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,	999
	To take the one the other, by some chance,	999
	Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends	999
	And interjoin their issues. So with me:	999
	My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon	999
	This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,	999
	He does fair justice; if he give me way,	999

Second Servingman	Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his	999
	head; that he gives entrance to such companions?	999
	Pray, get you out.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Away!	999
	999
Second Servingman	Away! get you away.	999

First Servingman	A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him	999
	out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.	999
	999
	[Retires]	999
	999
Third Servingman	What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid	999
	the house.	999

CORIOLANUS	Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.	999
	999
Third Servingman	What are you?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	A gentleman.	999
	999
Third Servingman	A marvellous poor one.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	True, so I am.	999
	999
Third Servingman	Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other	999
	station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.	999
	999
	[Pushes him away]	999
	999
Third Servingman	What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a	999
	strange guest he has here.	999
	999
Second Servingman	And I shall.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999

	999
CORIOLANUS	Ay.	999
	999
Third Servingman	Where's that?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I' the city of kites and crows.	999
	999
Third Servingman	I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!	999
	Then thou dwellest with daws too?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	No, I serve not thy master.	999
	999
Third Servingman	How, sir! do you meddle with my master?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy	999
	mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy	999
	trencher, hence!	999

	[Retires]	999

AUFIDIUS	Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?	999

CORIOLANUS	If, Tullus,	999
	999
	[Unmuffling]	999
	999
	Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not	999

CORIOLANUS	A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,	999
	And harsh in sound to thine.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Say, what's thy name?	999
	Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face	999
	Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.	999
	Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st	999
	thou me yet?	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	I know thee not: thy name?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done	999
	To thee particularly and to all the Volsces	999
	Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may	999
	My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,	999
	The extreme dangers and the drops of blood	999
	Shed for my thankless country are requited	999
	But with that surname; a good memory,	999
	And witness of the malice and displeasure	999
	Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;	999
	The cruelty and envy of the people,	999
	Permitted by our dastard nobles, who	999
	Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;	999
	And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be	999
	Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity	999
	Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--	999
	Mistake me not--to save my life, for if	999
	I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world	999
	I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,	999
	To be full quit of those my banishers,	999
	Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast	999
	A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge	999
	Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims	999
	Of shame seen through thy country, speed	999
	thee straight,	999
	And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it	999
	That my revengeful services may prove	999
	As benefits to thee, for I will fight	999
	Against my canker'd country with the spleen	999
	Of all the under fiends. But if so be	999
	Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes	999
	Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am	999
	Longer to live most weary, and present	999
	My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;	999
	Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,	999
	Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,	999
	Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,	999
	And cannot live but to thy shame, unless	999
	It be to do thee service.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	O Marcius, Marcius!	999
	Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart	999
	A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter	999
	Should from yond cloud speak divine things,	999
	And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more	999
	Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine	999
	Mine arms about that body, where against	999
	My grained ash an hundred times hath broke	999
	And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip	999
	The anvil of my sword, and do contest	999
	As hotly and as nobly with thy love	999
	As ever in ambitious strength I did	999
	Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,	999
	I loved the maid I married; never man	999
	Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,	999
	Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart	999
	Than when I first my wedded mistress saw	999
	Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,	999
	We have a power on foot; and I had purpose	999
	Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,	999
	Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out	999
	Twelve several times, and I have nightly since	999
	Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;	999
	We have been down together in my sleep,	999
	Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,	999
	And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,	999
	Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that	999
	Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all	999
	From twelve to seventy, and pouring war	999
	Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,	999
	Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,	999
	And take our friendly senators by the hands;	999
	Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,	999
	Who am prepared against your territories,	999
	Though not for Rome itself.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	You bless me, gods!	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have	999
	The leading of thine own revenges, take	999
	The one half of my commission; and set down--	999
	As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st	999
	Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;	999
	Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,	999
	Or rudely visit them in parts remote,	999
	To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:	999
	Let me commend thee first to those that shall	999
	Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!	999
	And more a friend than e'er an enemy;	999
	Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!	999
	999
	[Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two	999
	Servingmen come forward]	999
	999
First Servingman	Here's a strange alteration!	999
	999
Second Servingman	By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with	999
	a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a	999
	false report of him.	999
	999
First Servingman	What an arm he has! he turned me about with his	999
	finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.	999
	999
Second Servingman	Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in	999
	him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I	999
	cannot tell how to term it.	999
	999
First Servingman	He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,	999
	but I thought there was more in him than I could think.	999
	999
Second Servingman	So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest	999
	man i' the world.	999
	999
First Servingman	I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.	999
	999
Second Servingman	Who, my master?	999
	999
First Servingman	Nay, it's no matter for that.	999
	999
Second Servingman	Worth six on him.	999
	999
First Servingman	Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the	999
	greater soldier.	999
	999
Second Servingman	Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:	999
	for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.	999
	999
First Servingman	Ay, and for an assault too.	999
	999
	[Re-enter third Servingman]	999
	999
Third Servingman	O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!	999
	999
	999
First Servingman	|	999
	|  What, what, what? let's partake.	999
Second Servingman	|	999
	999
	999
Third Servingman	I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as	999
	lieve be a condemned man.	999
	999
	999
First Servingman	|	999
	|  Wherefore? wherefore?	999
Second Servingman	|	999
	999
	999
Third Servingman	Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,	999
	Caius Marcius.	999
	999
First Servingman	Why do you say 'thwack our general '?	999
	999
Third Servingman	I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always	999
	good enough for him.	999
	999
Second Servingman	Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too	999
	hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.	999
	999
First Servingman	He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth	999
	on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched	999
	him like a carbon ado.	999
	999
Second Servingman	An he had been cannibally given, he might have	999
	broiled and eaten him too.	999
	999
First Servingman	But, more of thy news?	999
	999
Third Servingman	Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son	999
	and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no	999
	question asked him by any of the senators, but they	999
	stand bald before him: our general himself makes a	999
	mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and	999
	turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But	999
	the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'	999
	the middle and but one half of what he was	999
	yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty	999
	and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,	999
	and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he	999
	will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.	999
	999
Second Servingman	And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.	999
	999
Third Servingman	Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as	999
	many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it	999
	were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as	999
	we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.	999
	999
First Servingman	Directitude! what's that?	999
	999
Third Servingman	But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,	999
	and the man in blood, they will out of their	999
	burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with	999
	him.	999
	999
First Servingman	But when goes this forward?	999
	999
Third Servingman	To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the	999
	drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a	999
	parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they	999
	wipe their lips.	999
	999
Second Servingman	Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.	999
	This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase	999
	tailors, and breed ballad-makers.	999
	999
First Servingman	Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as	999
	day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and	999
	full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;	999
	mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more	999
	bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.	999
	999
Second Servingman	'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to	999
	be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a	999
	great maker of cuckolds.	999
	999
First Servingman	Ay, and it makes men hate one another.	999
	999
Third Servingman	Reason; because they then less need one another.	999
	The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap	999
	as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.	999
	999
All	In, in, in, in!	999
	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE VI	Rome. A public place.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS]	999
	999
SICINIUS	We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;	999
	His remedies are tame i' the present peace	999
	And quietness of the people, which before	999
	Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends	999
	Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,	999
	Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold	999
	Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see	999
	Our tradesmen with in their shops and going	999
	About their functions friendly.	999
	999
BRUTUS	We stood to't in good time.	999
	999
	[Enter MENENIUS]	999
	999
		      Is this Menenius?	999
	999
SICINIUS	'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.	999
	999
Both Tribunes	Hail sir!	999
	999
MENENIUS	        Hail to you both!	999
	999
SICINIUS	Your Coriolanus	999
	Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:	999
	The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,	999
	Were he more angry at it.	999
	999
MENENIUS	All's well; and might have been much better, if	999
	He could have temporized.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Where is he, hear you?	999
	999
MENENIUS	Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife	999
	Hear nothing from him.	999
	999
	[Enter three or four Citizens]	999
	999
Citizens	The gods preserve you both!	999
	999
SICINIUS	God-den, our neighbours.	999
	999
BRUTUS	God-den to you all, god-den to you all.	999
	999
First Citizen	Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,	999
	Are bound to pray for you both.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Live, and thrive!	999
	999
BRUTUS	Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus	999
	Had loved you as we did.	999
	999
Citizens	Now the gods keep you!	999
	999
Both Tribunes	Farewell, farewell.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Citizens]	999
	999
SICINIUS	This is a happier and more comely time	999
	Than when these fellows ran about the streets,	999
	Crying confusion.	999
	999
BRUTUS	                  Caius Marcius was	999
	A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,	999
	O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,	999
	Self-loving,--	999
	999
SICINIUS	                  And affecting one sole throne,	999
	Without assistance.	999
	999
MENENIUS	I think not so.	999
	999
SICINIUS	We should by this, to all our lamentation,	999
	If he had gone forth consul, found it so.	999
	999
BRUTUS	The gods have well prevented it, and Rome	999
	Sits safe and still without him.	999
	999
	[Enter an AEdile]	999
	999
AEdile	Worthy tribunes,	999
	There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,	999
	Reports, the Volsces with two several powers	999
	Are enter'd in the Roman territories,	999
	And with the deepest malice of the war	999
	Destroy what lies before 'em.	999
	999
MENENIUS	'Tis Aufidius,	999
	Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,	999
	Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;	999
	Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,	999
	And durst not once peep out.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Come, what talk you	999
	Of Marcius?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be	999
	The Volsces dare break with us.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Cannot be!	999
	We have record that very well it can,	999
	And three examples of the like have been	999
	Within my age. But reason with the fellow,	999
	Before you punish him, where he heard this,	999
	Lest you shall chance to whip your information	999
	And beat the messenger who bids beware	999
	Of what is to be dreaded.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Tell not me:	999
	I know this cannot be.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Not possible.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	The nobles in great earnestness are going	999
	All to the senate-house: some news is come	999
	That turns their countenances.	999
	999
SICINIUS	'Tis this slave;--	999
	Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;	999
	Nothing but his report.	999
	999
Messenger	Yes, worthy sir,	999
	The slave's report is seconded; and more,	999
	More fearful, is deliver'd.	999
	999
SICINIUS	What more fearful?	999
	999
Messenger	It is spoke freely out of many mouths--	999
	How probable I do not know--that Marcius,	999
	Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,	999
	And vows revenge as spacious as between	999
	The young'st and oldest thing.	999
	999
SICINIUS	This is most likely!	999
	999
BRUTUS	Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish	999
	Good Marcius home again.	999
	999
SICINIUS	The very trick on't.	999
	999
MENENIUS	This is unlikely:	999
	He and Aufidius can no more atone	999
	Than violentest contrariety.	999
	999
	[Enter a second Messenger]	999
	999
Second Messenger	You are sent for to the senate:	999
	A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius	999
	Associated with Aufidius, rages	999
	Upon our territories; and have already	999
	O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took	999
	What lay before them.	999
	999
	[Enter COMINIUS]	999
	999
COMINIUS	O, you have made good work!	999
	999
MENENIUS	What news? what news?	999
	999
COMINIUS	You have holp to ravish your own daughters and	999
	To melt the city leads upon your pates,	999
	To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--	999
	999
MENENIUS	What's the news? what's the news?	999
	999
COMINIUS	Your temples burned in their cement, and	999
	Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined	999
	Into an auger's bore.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Pray now, your news?	999
	You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--	999
	If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--	999
	999
COMINIUS	If!	999
	He is their god: he leads them like a thing	999
	Made by some other deity than nature,	999
	That shapes man better; and they follow him,	999
	Against us brats, with no less confidence	999
	Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,	999
	Or butchers killing flies.	999
	999
MENENIUS	You have made good work,	999
	You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much	999
	on the voice of occupation and	999
	The breath of garlic-eaters!	999
	999
COMINIUS	He will shake	999
	Your Rome about your ears.	999
	999
MENENIUS	As Hercules	999
	Did shake down mellow fruit.	999
	You have made fair work!	999
	999
BRUTUS	But is this true, sir?	999
	999
COMINIUS	Ay; and you'll look pale	999
	Before you find it other. All the regions	999
	Do smilingly revolt; and who resist	999
	Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,	999
	And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?	999
	Your enemies and his find something in him.	999
	999
MENENIUS	We are all undone, unless	999
	The noble man have mercy.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Who shall ask it?	999
	The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people	999
	Deserve such pity of him as the wolf	999
	Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they	999
	Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even	999
	As those should do that had deserved his hate,	999
	And therein show'd like enemies.	999
	999
MENENIUS	'Tis true:	999
	If he were putting to my house the brand	999
	That should consume it, I have not the face	999
	To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,	999
	You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!	999
	999
COMINIUS	You have brought	999
	A trembling upon Rome, such as was never	999
	So incapable of help.	999
	999
Both Tribunes	Say not we brought it.	999
	999
MENENIUS	How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts	999
	And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,	999
	Who did hoot him out o' the city.	999
	999
COMINIUS	But I fear	999
	They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,	999
	The second name of men, obeys his points	999
	As if he were his officer: desperation	999
	Is all the policy, strength and defence,	999
	That Rome can make against them.	999
	999
	[Enter a troop of Citizens]	999
	999
MENENIUS	Here come the clusters.	999
	And is Aufidius with him? You are they	999
	That made the air unwholesome, when you cast	999
	Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at	999
	Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;	999
	And not a hair upon a soldier's head	999
	Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs	999
	As you threw caps up will he tumble down,	999
	And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;	999
	if he could burn us all into one coal,	999
	We have deserved it.	999
	999
Citizens	Faith, we hear fearful news.	999
	999
First Citizen	For mine own part,	999
	When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.	999
	999
Second Citizen	And so did I.	999
	999
Third Citizen	And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very	999
	many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and	999
	though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet	999
	it was against our will.	999
	999
COMINIUS	Ye re goodly things, you voices!	999
	999
MENENIUS	You have made	999
	Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?	999
	999
COMINIUS	O, ay, what else?	999
	999
	[Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS]	999
	999
SICINIUS	Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:	999
	These are a side that would be glad to have	999
	This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,	999
	And show no sign of fear.	999
	999
First Citizen	The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.	999
	I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished	999
	him.	999
	999
Second Citizen	So did we all. But, come, let's home.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Citizens]	999
	999
BRUTUS	I do not like this news.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Nor I.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth	999

SCENE VII	A camp, at a small distance from Rome.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant]	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Do they still fly to the Roman?	999
	999
Lieutenant	I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but	999
	Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,	999
	Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;	999
	And you are darken'd in this action, sir,	999
	Even by your own.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	                  I cannot help it now,	999
	Unless, by using means, I lame the foot	999
	Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,	999
	Even to my person, than I thought he would	999
	When first I did embrace him: yet his nature	999
	In that's no changeling; and I must excuse	999
	What cannot be amended.	999
	999
Lieutenant	Yet I wish, sir,--	999
	I mean for your particular,--you had not	999
	Join'd in commission with him; but either	999
	Had borne the action of yourself, or else	999
	To him had left it solely.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	I understand thee well; and be thou sure,	999
	when he shall come to his account, he knows not	999
	What I can urge against him. Although it seems,	999
	And so he thinks, and is no less apparent	999
	To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.	999
	And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,	999
	Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon	999
	As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone	999
	That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,	999
	Whene'er we come to our account.	999
	999
Lieutenant	Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	All places yield to him ere he sits down;	999
	And the nobility of Rome are his:	999
	The senators and patricians love him too:	999
	The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people	999
	Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty	999
	To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome	999
	As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it	999
	By sovereignty of nature. First he was	999
	A noble servant to them; but he could not	999
	Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,	999
	Which out of daily fortune ever taints	999
	The happy man; whether defect of judgment,	999
	To fail in the disposing of those chances	999
	Which he was lord of; or whether nature,	999
	Not to be other than one thing, not moving	999
	From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace	999
	Even with the same austerity and garb	999
	As he controll'd the war; but one of these--	999
	As he hath spices of them all, not all,	999
	For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,	999
	So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,	999
	To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues	999
	Lie in the interpretation of the time:	999
	And power, unto itself most commendable,	999
	Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair	999
	To extol what it hath done.	999
	One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;	999
	Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.	999
	Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,	999
	Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS, BRUTUS,	999
	and others]	999
	999
MENENIUS	No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said	999
	Which was sometime his general; who loved him	999
	In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:	999
	But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;	999
	A mile before his tent fall down, and knee	999
	The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd	999
	To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.	999
	999
COMINIUS	He would not seem to know me.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Do you hear?	999
	999
COMINIUS	Yet one time he did call me by my name:	999
	I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops	999
	That we have bled together. Coriolanus	999
	He would not answer to: forbad all names;	999
	He was a kind of nothing, titleless,	999
	Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire	999
	Of burning Rome.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Why, so: you have made good work!	999
	A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,	999
	To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!	999
	999
COMINIUS	I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon	999
	When it was less expected: he replied,	999
	It was a bare petition of a state	999
	To one whom they had punish'd.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Very well:	999
	Could he say less?	999
	999
COMINIUS	I offer'd to awaken his regard	999
	For's private friends: his answer to me was,	999
	He could not stay to pick them in a pile	999
	Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,	999
	For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,	999
	And still to nose the offence.	999
	999
MENENIUS	For one poor grain or two!	999
	I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,	999
	And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:	999
	You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt	999
	Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid	999
	In this so never-needed help, yet do not	999
	Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you	999
	Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,	999
	More than the instant army we can make,	999
	Might stop our countryman.	999
	999
MENENIUS	No, I'll not meddle.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Pray you, go to him.	999
	999
MENENIUS	What should I do?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Only make trial what your love can do	999
	For Rome, towards Marcius.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Well, and say that Marcius	999
	Return me, as Cominius is return'd,	999
	Unheard; what then?	999
	But as a discontented friend, grief-shot	999
	With his unkindness? say't be so?	999
	999
SICINIUS	Yet your good will	999
	must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure	999
	As you intended well.	999
	999
MENENIUS	I'll undertake 't:	999
	I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip	999
	And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.	999
	He was not taken well; he had not dined:	999
	The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then	999
	We pout upon the morning, are unapt	999
	To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd	999
	These and these conveyances of our blood	999
	With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls	999
	Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him	999
	Till he be dieted to my request,	999
	And then I'll set upon him.	999
	999
BRUTUS	You know the very road into his kindness,	999
	And cannot lose your way.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Good faith, I'll prove him,	999
	Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge	999
	Of my success.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999

COMINIUS	                  He'll never hear him.	999

SICINIUS	Not?	999
	999
COMINIUS	I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye	999
	Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury	999
	The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;	999
	'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me	999
	Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,	999
	He sent in writing after me; what he would not,	999
	Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:	999
	So that all hope is vain.	999
	Unless his noble mother, and his wife;	999
	Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him	999
	For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,	999
	And with our fair entreaties haste them on.	999

	999
First Senator	Stay: whence are you?	999
	999
Second Senator	Stand, and go back.	999
	999
MENENIUS	You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,	999
	I am an officer of state, and come	999
	To speak with Coriolanus.	999
	999
First Senator	From whence?	999
	999
MENENIUS	From Rome.	999
	999
First Senator	You may not pass, you must return: our general	999
	Will no more hear from thence.	999
	999
Second Senator	You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before	999
	You'll speak with Coriolanus.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Good my friends,	999
	If you have heard your general talk of Rome,	999
	And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,	999
	My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.	999
	999
First Senator	Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name	999
	Is not here passable.	999
	999
MENENIUS	I tell thee, fellow,	999
	The general is my lover: I have been	999
	The book of his good acts, whence men have read	999
	His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;	999
	For I have ever verified my friends,	999
	Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity	999
	Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,	999
	Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,	999
	I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise	999
	Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,	999
	I must have leave to pass.	999
	999
First Senator	Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his	999
	behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you	999
	should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous	999
	to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,	999
	always factionary on the party of your general.	999
	999
Second Senator	Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you	999
	have, I am one that, telling true under him, must	999
	say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not	999
	speak with him till after dinner.	999
	999
First Senator	You are a Roman, are you?	999
	999
MENENIUS	I am, as thy general is.	999
	999
First Senator	Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,	999
	when you have pushed out your gates the very	999
	defender of them, and, in a violent popular	999
	ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to	999
	front his revenges with the easy groans of old	999
	women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with	999
	the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as	999
	you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the	999
	intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with	999
	such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;	999
	therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your	999
	execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn	999
	you out of reprieve and pardon.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would	999
	use me with estimation.	999
	999
Second Senator	Come, my captain knows you not.	999
	999
MENENIUS	I mean, thy general.	999
	999
First Senator	My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest	999
	I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's	999
	the utmost of your having: back.	999
	999
MENENIUS	Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--	999
	999
	[Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS]	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	What's the matter?	999
	999
MENENIUS	Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:	999
	You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall	999
	perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from	999
	my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment	999
	with him, if thou standest not i' the state of	999
	hanging, or of some death more long in	999
	spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now	999
	presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.	999
	999
	[To CORIOLANUS]	999
	999
	The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy	999
	particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than	999
	thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!	999
	thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's	999
	water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to	999
	thee; but being assured none but myself could move	999
	thee, I have been blown out of your gates with	999
	sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy	999
	petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy	999
	wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet	999
	here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my	999
	access to thee.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Away!	999
	999
MENENIUS	How! away!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs	999
	Are servanted to others: though I owe	999
	My revenge properly, my remission lies	999
	In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,	999
	Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather	999
	Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.	999
	Mine ears against your suits are stronger than	999
	Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,	999
	Take this along; I writ it for thy sake	999
	999
	[Gives a letter]	999
	999
	And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,	999
	I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,	999
	Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	You keep a constant temper.	999
	999
	[Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS]	999
	999
First Senator	Now, sir, is your name Menenius?	999
	999
Second Senator	'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the	999
	way home again.	999
	999
First Senator	Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your	999
	greatness back?	999
	999
Second Senator	What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?	999
	999
MENENIUS	I neither care for the world nor your general: for	999
	such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,	999
	ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by	999
	himself fears it not from another: let your general	999
	do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and	999
	your misery increase with your age! I say to you,	999
	as I was said to, Away!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999

	999
	[Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and others]	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow	999
	Set down our host. My partner in this action,	999
	You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly	999
	I have borne this business.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Only their ends	999
	You have respected; stopp'd your ears against	999
	The general suit of Rome; never admitted	999
	A private whisper, no, not with such friends	999
	That thought them sure of you.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	This last old man,	999
	Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,	999
	Loved me above the measure of a father;	999
	Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge	999
	Was to send him; for whose old love I have,	999
	Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd	999
	The first conditions, which they did refuse	999
	And cannot now accept; to grace him only	999
	That thought he could do more, a very little	999
	I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,	999
	Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter	999
	Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?	999
	999
	[Shout within]	999
	999
	Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow	999
	In the same time 'tis made? I will not.	999
	999
	[Enter in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA,	999
	leading young MARCIUS, VALERIA, and Attendants]	999
	999
	My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould	999
	Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand	999
	The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!	999
	All bond and privilege of nature, break!	999
	Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.	999
	What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,	999
	Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not	999
	Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;	999
	As if Olympus to a molehill should	999
	In supplication nod: and my young boy	999
	Hath an aspect of intercession, which	999
	Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces	999
	Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never	999
	Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,	999
	As if a man were author of himself	999
	And knew no other kin.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	My lord and husband!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	The sorrow that delivers us thus changed	999
	Makes you think so.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Like a dull actor now,	999
	I have forgot my part, and I am out,	999
	Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,	999
	Forgive my tyranny; but do not say	999
	For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss	999
	Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!	999
	Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss	999
	I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip	999
	Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,	999
	And the most noble mother of the world	999
	Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;	999
	999
	[Kneels]	999
	999
	Of thy deep duty more impression show	999
	Than that of common sons.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	O, stand up blest!	999
	Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,	999
	I kneel before thee; and unproperly	999
	Show duty, as mistaken all this while	999
	Between the child and parent.	999
	999
	[Kneels]	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	What is this?	999

	Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;	999
	Murdering impossibility, to make	999
	What cannot be, slight work.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Thou art my warrior;	999
	I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	The noble sister of Publicola,	999
	The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle	999
	That's curdied by the frost from purest snow	999
	And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	This is a poor epitome of yours,	999
	Which by the interpretation of full time	999
	May show like all yourself.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	The god of soldiers,	999
	With the consent of supreme Jove, inform	999
	Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove	999
	To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars	999
	Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,	999
	And saving those that eye thee!	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Your knee, sirrah.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	That's my brave boy!	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,	999
	Are suitors to you.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I beseech you, peace:	999
	Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:	999
	The thing I have forsworn to grant may never	999
	Be held by you denials. Do not bid me	999
	Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate	999
	Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not	999
	Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not	999
	To ally my rages and revenges with	999
	Your colder reasons.	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	O, no more, no more!	999
	You have said you will not grant us any thing;	999
	For we have nothing else to ask, but that	999
	Which you deny already: yet we will ask;	999
	That, if you fail in our request, the blame	999
	May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll	999
	Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment	999
	And state of bodies would bewray what life	999
	We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself	999
	How more unfortunate than all living women	999
	Are we come hither: since that thy sight,	999
	which should	999
	Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance	999
	with comforts,	999
	Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;	999
	Making the mother, wife and child to see	999
	The son, the husband and the father tearing	999
	His country's bowels out. And to poor we	999
	Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us	999
	Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort	999
	That all but we enjoy; for how can we,	999
	Alas, how can we for our country pray.	999
	Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,	999
	Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose	999
	The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,	999
	Our comfort in the country. We must find	999
	An evident calamity, though we had	999
	Our wish, which side should win: for either thou	999
	Must, as a foreign recreant, be led	999
	With manacles thorough our streets, or else	999
	triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,	999
	And bear the palm for having bravely shed	999
	Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,	999
	I purpose not to wait on fortune till	999
	These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee	999
	Rather to show a noble grace to both parts	999
	Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner	999
	March to assault thy country than to tread--	999
	Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,	999
	That brought thee to this world.	999
	999
VIRGILIA	Ay, and mine,	999
	That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name	999
	Living to time.	999
	999
Young MARCIUS	A' shall not tread on me;	999
	I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Not of a woman's tenderness to be,	999
	Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.	999
	I have sat too long.	999
	999
	[Rising]	999
	999
VOLUMNIA	Nay, go not from us thus.	999
	If it were so that our request did tend	999
	To save the Romans, thereby to destroy	999
	The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,	999
	As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit	999
	Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces	999
	May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,	999
	'This we received;' and each in either side	999
	Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest	999
	For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,	999
	The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,	999
	That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit	999
	Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,	999
	Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;	999
	Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,	999
	But with his last attempt he wiped it out;	999
	Destroy'd his country, and his name remains	999
	To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:	999
	Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,	999
	To imitate the graces of the gods;	999
	To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,	999
	And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt	999
	That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?	999
	Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man	999
	Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:	999
	He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:	999
	Perhaps thy childishness will move him more	999
	Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world	999
	More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate	999
	Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life	999
	Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,	999
	When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,	999
	Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,	999
	Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,	999
	And spurn me back: but if it be not so,	999
	Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,	999
	That thou restrain'st from me the duty which	999
	To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:	999
	Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.	999
	To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride	999
	Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;	999
	This is the last: so we will home to Rome,	999
	And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:	999
	This boy, that cannot tell what he would have	999
	But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,	999
	Does reason our petition with more strength	999
	Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:	999
	This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;	999
	His wife is in Corioli and his child	999
	Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:	999
	I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,	999
	And then I'll speak a little.	999
	999
	[He holds her by the hand, silent]	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	O mother, mother!	999
	What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,	999
	The gods look down, and this unnatural scene	999
	They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!	999
	You have won a happy victory to Rome;	999
	But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,	999
	Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,	999
	If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.	999
	Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,	999
	I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,	999
	Were you in my stead, would you have heard	999
	A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	I was moved withal.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	I dare be sworn you were:	999
	And, sir, it is no little thing to make	999
	Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,	999
	What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,	999
	I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,	999
	Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	[Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and	999
	thy honour	999
	At difference in thee: out of that I'll work	999
	Myself a former fortune.	999
	999
	[The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS]	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Ay, by and by;	999
	999
	[To VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, &c]	999
	999
	But we will drink together; and you shall bear	999
	A better witness back than words, which we,	999
	On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.	999
	Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve	999
	To have a temple built you: all the swords	999
	In Italy, and her confederate arms,	999
	Could not have made this peace.	999

SCENE IV	Rome. A public place.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS]	999
	999
MENENIUS	See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond	999
	corner-stone?	999
	999
SICINIUS	Why, what of that?	999
	999
MENENIUS	If it be possible for you to displace it with your	999
	little finger, there is some hope the ladies of	999
	Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.	999
	But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are	999
	sentenced and stay upon execution.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Is't possible that so short a time can alter the	999
	condition of a man!	999
	999
MENENIUS	There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;	999
	yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown	999
	from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a	999
	creeping thing.	999
	999
SICINIUS	He loved his mother dearly.	999
	999
MENENIUS	So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother	999
	now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness	999
	of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he	999
	moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before	999
	his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with	999
	his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a	999
	battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for	999
	Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with	999
	his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity	999
	and a heaven to throne in.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.	999
	999
MENENIUS	I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his	999
	mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy	999
	in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that	999
	shall our poor city find: and all this is long of	999
	you.	999
	999
SICINIUS	The gods be good unto us!	999
	999
MENENIUS	No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto	999
	us. When we banished him, we respected not them;	999
	and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:	999
	The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune	999
	And hale him up and down, all swearing, if	999
	The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,	999
	They'll give him death by inches.	999
	999
	[Enter a second Messenger]	999
	999
SICINIUS	What's the news?	999
	999
Second Messenger	Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,	999
	The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:	999
	A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,	999
	No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.	999
	999
SICINIUS	Friend,	999
	Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?	999
	999
Second Messenger	As certain as I know the sun is fire:	999
	Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?	999
	Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,	999
	As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!	999
	999
	[Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together]	999
	999
	The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,	999
	Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,	999
	Make the sun dance. Hark you!	999
	999
	[A shout within]	999
	999
MENENIUS	This is good news:	999
	I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia	999
	Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,	999
	A city full; of tribunes, such as you,	999
	A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:	999
	This morning for ten thousand of your throats	999
	I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!	999
	999
	[Music still, with shouts]	999
	999
SICINIUS	First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,	999
	Accept my thankfulness.	999
	999
Second Messenger	Sir, we have all	999
	Great cause to give great thanks.	999
	999
SICINIUS	They are near the city?	999
	999
Second Messenger	Almost at point to enter.	999
	999
SICINIUS	We will meet them,	999
	And help the joy.	999

	999
First Senator	Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!	999
	Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,	999
	And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:	999
	Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,	999
	Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;	999

	999
	[Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with Attendants]	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:	999
	Deliver them this paper: having read it,	999
	Bid them repair to the market place; where I,	999
	Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,	999
	Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse	999
	The city ports by this hath enter'd and	999
	Intends to appear before the people, hoping	999
	To purge herself with words: dispatch.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Attendants]	999
	999
	[Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction]	999
	999
	Most welcome!	999
	999
First Conspirator	How is it with our general?	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Even so	999
	As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,	999
	And with his charity slain.	999
	999
Second Conspirator	Most noble sir,	999
	If you do hold the same intent wherein	999
	You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you	999
	Of your great danger.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Sir, I cannot tell:	999
	We must proceed as we do find the people.	999
	999
Third Conspirator	The people will remain uncertain whilst	999
	'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either	999
	Makes the survivor heir of all.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	I know it;	999
	And my pretext to strike at him admits	999
	A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd	999
	Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,	999
	He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,	999
	Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,	999
	He bow'd his nature, never known before	999
	But to be rough, unswayable and free.	999
	999
Third Conspirator	Sir, his stoutness	999
	When he did stand for consul, which he lost	999
	By lack of stooping,--	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	That I would have spoke of:	999
	Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;	999
	Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;	999
	Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way	999
	In all his own desires; nay, let him choose	999
	Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,	999
	My best and freshest men; served his designments	999
	In mine own person; holp to reap the fame	999
	Which he did end all his; and took some pride	999
	To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,	999
	I seem'd his follower, not partner, and	999
	He waged me with his countenance, as if	999
	I had been mercenary.	999
	999
First Conspirator	So he did, my lord:	999
	The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,	999
	When he had carried Rome and that we look'd	999
	For no less spoil than glory,--	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	There was it:	999
	For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.	999
	At a few drops of women's rheum, which are	999
	As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour	999
	Of our great action: therefore shall he die,	999
	And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!	999
	999
	[Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of	999
	the People]	999
	999
First Conspirator	Your native town you enter'd like a post,	999
	And had no welcomes home: but he returns,	999
	Splitting the air with noise.	999
	999
Second Conspirator	And patient fools,	999
	Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear	999
	With giving him glory.	999
	999
Third Conspirator	Therefore, at your vantage,	999
	Ere he express himself, or move the people	999
	With what he would say, let him feel your sword,	999
	Which we will second. When he lies along,	999
	After your way his tale pronounced shall bury	999
	His reasons with his body.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Say no more:	999
	Here come the lords.	999
	999
	[Enter the Lords of the city]	999
	999
All The Lords	You are most welcome home.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	I have not deserved it.	999
	But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused	999
	What I have written to you?	999
	999
Lords	We have.	999
	999
First Lord	And grieve to hear't.	999
	What faults he made before the last, I think	999
	Might have found easy fines: but there to end	999
	Where he was to begin and give away	999
	The benefit of our levies, answering us	999
	With our own charge, making a treaty where	999
	There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	He approaches: you shall hear him.	999
	999
	[Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and	999
	colours; commoners being with him]	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,	999
	No more infected with my country's love	999
	Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting	999
	Under your great command. You are to know	999
	That prosperously I have attempted and	999
	With bloody passage led your wars even to	999
	The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home	999
	Do more than counterpoise a full third part	999
	The charges of the action. We have made peace	999
	With no less honour to the Antiates	999
	Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,	999
	Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,	999
	Together with the seal o' the senate, what	999
	We have compounded on.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Read it not, noble lords;	999
	But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree	999
	He hath abused your powers.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Traitor! how now!	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	                  Ay, traitor, Marcius!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Marcius!	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think	999
	I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name	999
	Coriolanus in Corioli?	999
	You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously	999
	He has betray'd your business, and given up,	999
	For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,	999
	I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;	999
	Breaking his oath and resolution like	999
	A twist of rotten silk, never admitting	999
	Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears	999
	He whined and roar'd away your victory,	999
	That pages blush'd at him and men of heart	999
	Look'd wondering each at other.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Hear'st thou, Mars?	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Name not the god, thou boy of tears!	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Ha!	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	No more.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart	999
	Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!	999
	Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever	999
	I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,	999
	Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--	999
	Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that	999
	Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join	999
	To thrust the lie unto him.	999
	999
First Lord	Peace, both, and hear me speak.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,	999
	Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!	999
	If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,	999
	That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I	999
	Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:	999
	Alone I did it. Boy!	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Why, noble lords,	999
	Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,	999
	Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,	999
	'Fore your own eyes and ears?	999
	999
All Conspirators	Let him die for't.	999
	999
All The People	'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd	999
	my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin	999
	Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'	999
	999
Second Lord	Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!	999
	The man is noble and his fame folds-in	999
	This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us	999
	Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,	999
	And trouble not the peace.	999
	999
CORIOLANUS	O that I had him,	999
	With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,	999
	To use my lawful sword!	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	Insolent villain!	999
	999
All Conspirators	Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!	999
	999
	[The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS:	999
	AUFIDIUS stands on his body]	999
	999
Lords	Hold, hold, hold, hold!	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	My noble masters, hear me speak.	999
	999
First Lord	O Tullus,--	999
	999
Second Lord	Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.	999
	999
Third Lord	Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;	999
	Put up your swords.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,	999
	Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger	999
	Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice	999
	That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours	999
	To call me to your senate, I'll deliver	999
	Myself your loyal servant, or endure	999
	Your heaviest censure.	999
	999
First Lord	Bear from hence his body;	999
	And mourn you for him: let him be regarded	999
	As the most noble corse that ever herald	999
	Did follow to his urn.	999
	999
Second Lord	His own impatience	999
	Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.	999
	Let's make the best of it.	999
	999
AUFIDIUS	My rage is gone;	999
	And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.	999
	Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.	999
	Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:	999
	Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he	999
	Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,	999
	Which to this hour bewail the injury,	999
	Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.	999

	CYMBELINE	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter two Gentlemen]	999
	999
First Gentleman	You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods	999
	No more obey the heavens than our courtiers	999
	Still seem as does the king.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	But what's the matter?	999
	999
First Gentleman	His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom	999
	He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow	999
	That late he married--hath referr'd herself	999
	Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;	999
	Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all	999
	Is outward sorrow; though I think the king	999
	Be touch'd at very heart.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	None but the king?	999
	999
First Gentleman	He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,	999
	That most desired the match; but not a courtier,	999
	Although they wear their faces to the bent	999
	Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not	999
	Glad at the thing they scowl at.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	And why so?	999
	999
First Gentleman	He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing	999
	Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--	999
	I mean, that married her, alack, good man!	999
	And therefore banish'd--is a creature such	999
	As, to seek through the regions of the earth	999
	For one his like, there would be something failing	999
	In him that should compare. I do not think	999
	So fair an outward and such stuff within	999
	Endows a man but he.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	You speak him far.	999
	999
First Gentleman	I do extend him, sir, within himself,	999
	Crush him together rather than unfold	999
	His measure duly.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	                  What's his name and birth?	999
	999
First Gentleman	I cannot delve him to the root: his father	999
	Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour	999
	Against the Romans with Cassibelan,	999
	But had his titles by Tenantius whom	999
	He served with glory and admired success,	999
	So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;	999
	And had, besides this gentleman in question,	999
	Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time	999
	Died with their swords in hand; for which	999
	their father,	999
	Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow	999
	That he quit being, and his gentle lady,	999
	Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased	999
	As he was born. The king he takes the babe	999
	To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,	999
	Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,	999
	Puts to him all the learnings that his time	999
	Could make him the receiver of; which he took,	999
	As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,	999
	And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--	999
	Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,	999
	A sample to the youngest, to the more mature	999
	A glass that feated them, and to the graver	999
	A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,	999
	For whom he now is banish'd, her own price	999
	Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;	999
	By her election may be truly read	999
	What kind of man he is.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	I honour him	999
	Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,	999
	Is she sole child to the king?	999
	999
First Gentleman	His only child.	999
	He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,	999
	Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,	999
	I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery	999
	Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge	999
	Which way they went.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	How long is this ago?	999
	999
First Gentleman	Some twenty years.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	That a king's children should be so convey'd,	999
	So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,	999
	That could not trace them!	999
	999
First Gentleman	Howsoe'er 'tis strange,	999
	Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,	999
	Yet is it true, sir.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	I do well believe you.	999
	999
First Gentleman	We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,	999
	The queen, and princess.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN]	999
	999
QUEEN	No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,	999
	After the slander of most stepmothers,	999
	Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but	999
	Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys	999
	That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,	999
	So soon as I can win the offended king,	999
	I will be known your advocate: marry, yet	999
	The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good	999
	You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience	999
	Your wisdom may inform you.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Please your highness,	999
	I will from hence to-day.	999
	999
QUEEN	You know the peril.	999
	I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying	999
	The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king	999
	Hath charged you should not speak together.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
IMOGEN	O	999
	Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant	999
	Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,	999
	I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--	999
	Always reserved my holy duty--what	999
	His rage can do on me: you must be gone;	999
	And I shall here abide the hourly shot	999
	Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,	999
	But that there is this jewel in the world	999
	That I may see again.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	My queen! my mistress!	999
	O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause	999
	To be suspected of more tenderness	999
	Than doth become a man. I will remain	999
	The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:	999
	My residence in Rome at one Philario's,	999
	Who to my father was a friend, to me	999
	Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,	999
	And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,	999
	Though ink be made of gall.	999
	999
	[Re-enter QUEEN]	999
	999
QUEEN	Be brief, I pray you:	999
	If the king come, I shall incur I know not	999
	How much of his displeasure.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
		        Yet I'll move him	999
	To walk this way: I never do him wrong,	999
	But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;	999
	Pays dear for my offences.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Should we be taking leave	999
	As long a term as yet we have to live,	999
	The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!	999
	999
IMOGEN	Nay, stay a little:	999
	Were you but riding forth to air yourself,	999
	Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;	999
	This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;	999
	But keep it till you woo another wife,	999
	When Imogen is dead.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	How, how! another?	999
	You gentle gods, give me but this I have,	999
	And sear up my embracements from a next	999
	With bonds of death!	999
	999
	[Putting on the ring]	999
	999
		Remain, remain thou here	999
	While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,	999
	As I my poor self did exchange for you,	999
	To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles	999
	I still win of you: for my sake wear this;	999
	It is a manacle of love; I'll place it	999
	Upon this fairest prisoner.	999
	999
	[Putting a bracelet upon her arm]	999
	999
IMOGEN	O the gods!	999
	When shall we see again?	999
	999
	[Enter CYMBELINE and Lords]	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Alack, the king!	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!	999
	If after this command thou fraught the court	999
	With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!	999
	Thou'rt poison to my blood.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	The gods protect you!	999
	And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
IMOGEN	                  There cannot be a pinch in death	999
	More sharp than this is.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	O disloyal thing,	999
	That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st	999
	A year's age on me.	999
	999
IMOGEN	I beseech you, sir,	999
	Harm not yourself with your vexation	999
	I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare	999
	Subdues all pangs, all fears.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Past grace? obedience?	999
	999
IMOGEN	Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!	999
	999
IMOGEN	O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,	999
	And did avoid a puttock.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne	999
	A seat for baseness.	999
	999
IMOGEN	No; I rather added	999
	A lustre to it.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	                  O thou vile one!	999
	999
IMOGEN	Sir,	999
	It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:	999
	You bred him as my playfellow, and he is	999
	A man worth any woman, overbuys me	999
	Almost the sum he pays.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	What, art thou mad?	999
	999
IMOGEN	Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were	999
	A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus	999
	Our neighbour shepherd's son!	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Thou foolish thing!	999
	999
	[Re-enter QUEEN]	999
	999
	They were again together: you have done	999
	Not after our command. Away with her,	999
	And pen her up.	999
	999
QUEEN	                  Beseech your patience. Peace,	999
	Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,	999
	Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort	999
	Out of your best advice.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Nay, let her languish	999
	A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,	999
	Die of this folly!	999
	999
	[Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords]	999
	999
QUEEN	                  Fie! you must give way.	999
	999
	[Enter PISANIO]	999
	999
	Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?	999
	999
PISANIO	My lord your son drew on my master.	999
	999
QUEEN	Ha!	999
	No harm, I trust, is done?	999
	999
PISANIO	There might have been,	999
	But that my master rather play'd than fought	999
	And had no help of anger: they were parted	999
	By gentlemen at hand.	999
	999
QUEEN	I am very glad on't.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.	999
	To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!	999
	I would they were in Afric both together;	999
	Myself by with a needle, that I might prick	999
	The goer-back. Why came you from your master?	999
	999
PISANIO	On his command: he would not suffer me	999
	To bring him to the haven; left these notes	999
	Of what commands I should be subject to,	999
	When 't pleased you to employ me.	999
	999
QUEEN	This hath been	999
	Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour	999
	He will remain so.	999
	999
PISANIO	                  I humbly thank your highness.	999
	999
QUEEN	Pray, walk awhile.	999
	999
IMOGEN	                  About some half-hour hence,	999
	I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least	999
	Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.	999

	999
	[Enter CLOTEN and two Lords]	999
	999
First Lord	Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the	999
	violence of action hath made you reek as a	999
	sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:	999
	there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.	999
	999
CLOTEN	If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside]  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.	999
	999
First Lord	Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be	999
	not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside]  His steel was in debt; it went o' the	999
	backside the town.	999
	999
CLOTEN	The villain would not stand me.	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside]  No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.	999
	999
First Lord	Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but	999
	he added to your having; gave you some ground.	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!	999
	999
CLOTEN	I would they had not come between us.	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside]  So would I, till you had measured how long	999
	a fool you were upon the ground.	999
	999
CLOTEN	And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election, she	999
	is damned.	999
	999
First Lord	Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain	999
	go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen	999
	small reflection of her wit.	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside]  She shines not upon fools, lest the	999
	reflection should hurt her.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some	999
	hurt done!	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside]  I wish not so; unless it had been the fall	999
	of an ass, which is no great hurt.	999
	999
CLOTEN	You'll go with us?	999
	999
First Lord	I'll attend your lordship.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Nay, come, let's go together.	999

SCENE III	A room in Cymbeline's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO]	999
	999
IMOGEN	I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,	999
	And question'dst every sail: if he should write	999
	And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,	999
	As offer'd mercy is. What was the last	999
	That he spake to thee?	999
	999
PISANIO	It was his queen, his queen!	999
	999
IMOGEN	Then waved his handkerchief?	999
	999
PISANIO	And kiss'd it, madam.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!	999
	And that was all?	999
	999
PISANIO	                  No, madam; for so long	999
	As he could make me with this eye or ear	999
	Distinguish him from others, he did keep	999
	The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,	999
	Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind	999
	Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,	999
	How swift his ship.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Thou shouldst have made him	999
	As little as a crow, or less, ere left	999
	To after-eye him.	999
	999
PISANIO	                  Madam, so I did.	999
	999
IMOGEN	I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but	999
	To look upon him, till the diminution	999
	Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,	999
	Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from	999
	The smallness of a gnat to air, and then	999
	Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,	999
	When shall we hear from him?	999
	999
PISANIO	Be assured, madam,	999
	With his next vantage.	999
	999
IMOGEN	I did not take my leave of him, but had	999
	Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him	999
	How I would think on him at certain hours	999
	Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear	999
	The shes of Italy should not betray	999
	Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,	999
	At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,	999
	To encounter me with orisons, for then	999
	I am in heaven for him; or ere I could	999
	Give him that parting kiss which I had set	999
	Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father	999
	And like the tyrannous breathing of the north	999
	Shakes all our buds from growing.	999
	999
	[Enter a Lady]	999
	999
Lady	The queen, madam,	999

ACT I	999

	999
	999
SCENE IV	Rome. Philario's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a	999
	Dutchman, and a Spaniard]	999
	999
IACHIMO	Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was	999
	then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy	999
	as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I	999
	could then have looked on him without the help of	999
	admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments	999
	had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.	999
	999
PHILARIO	You speak of him when he was less furnished than now	999
	he is with that which makes him both without and within.	999
	999
Frenchman	I have seen him in France: we had very many there	999
	could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.	999
	999
IACHIMO	This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein	999
	he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,	999
	words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.	999
	999
Frenchman	And then his banishment.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this	999
	lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully	999
	to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,	999
	which else an easy battery might lay flat, for	999
	taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes	999
	it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps	999
	acquaintance?	999
	999
PHILARIO	His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I	999
	have been often bound for no less than my life.	999
	Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained	999
	amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your	999
	knowing, to a stranger of his quality.	999
	999
	[Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS]	999
	999
	I beseech you all, be better known to this	999
	gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend	999
	of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear	999
	hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.	999
	999
Frenchman	Sir, we have known together in Orleans.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,	999
	which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.	999
	999
Frenchman	Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I	999
	did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity	999
	you should have been put together with so mortal a	999
	purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so	999
	slight and trivial a nature.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;	999
	rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in	999
	my every action to be guided by others' experiences:	999
	but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say	999
	it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.	999
	999
Frenchman	'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,	999
	and by such two that would by all likelihood have	999
	confounded one the other, or have fallen both.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?	999
	999
Frenchman	Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,	999
	which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.	999
	It was much like an argument that fell out last	999
	night, where each of us fell in praise of our	999
	country mistresses; this gentleman at that time	999
	vouching--and upon warrant of bloody	999
	affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,	999
	chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable	999
	than any the rarest of our ladies in France.	999
	999
IACHIMO	That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's	999
	opinion by this worn out.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	She holds her virtue still and I my mind.	999
	999
IACHIMO	You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would	999
	abate her nothing, though I profess myself her	999
	adorer, not her friend.	999
	999
IACHIMO	As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand	999
	comparison--had been something too fair and too good	999
	for any lady in Britain. If she went before others	999
	I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres	999
	many I have beheld. I could not but believe she	999
	excelled many: but I have not seen the most	999
	precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.	999
	999
IACHIMO	What do you esteem it at?	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	More than the world enjoys.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's	999
	outprized by a trifle.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if	999
	there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit	999
	for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,	999
	and only the gift of the gods.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Which the gods have given you?	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Which, by their graces, I will keep.	999
	999
IACHIMO	You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,	999
	strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your	999
	ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable	999
	estimations; the one is but frail and the other	999
	casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished	999
	courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier	999
	to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the	999
	holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do	999
	nothing doubt you have store of thieves;	999
	notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.	999
	999
PHILARIO	Let us leave here, gentlemen.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I	999
	thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.	999
	999
IACHIMO	With five times so much conversation, I should get	999
	ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even	999
	to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	No, no.	999
	999
IACHIMO	I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to	999
	your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it	999
	something: but I make my wager rather against your	999
	confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your	999
	offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any	999
	lady in the world.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	You are a great deal abused in too bold a	999
	persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're	999
	worthy of by your attempt.	999
	999
IACHIMO	What's that?	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,	999
	deserve more; a punishment too.	999
	999
PHILARIO	Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;	999
	let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be	999
	better acquainted.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the	999
	approbation of what I have spoke!	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	What lady would you choose to assail?	999
	999
IACHIMO	Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.	999
	I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,	999
	that, commend me to the court where your lady is,	999
	with no more advantage than the opportunity of a	999
	second conference, and I will bring from thence	999
	that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring	999
	I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.	999
	999
IACHIMO	You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy	999
	ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot	999
	preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some	999
	religion in you, that you fear.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a	999
	graver purpose, I hope.	999
	999
IACHIMO	I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo	999
	what's spoken, I swear.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your	999
	return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my	999
	mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your	999
	unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.	999
	999
PHILARIO	I will have it no lay.	999
	999
IACHIMO	By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no	999
	sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest	999
	bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats	999
	are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,	999
	and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,	999
	she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are	999
	yours: provided I have your commendation for my more	999
	free entertainment.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I embrace these conditions; let us have articles	999
	betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if	999
	you make your voyage upon her and give me directly	999
	to understand you have prevailed, I am no further	999
	your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she	999
	remain unseduced, you not making it appear	999
	otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you	999
	have made to her chastity you shall answer me with	999
	your sword.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set	999
	down by lawful counsel, and straight away for	999
	Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and	999
	starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two	999
	wagers recorded.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Agreed.	999
	999
	[Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMO]	999
	999
Frenchman	Will this hold, think you?	999
	999
PHILARIO	Signior Iachimo will not from it.	999
	Pray, let us follow 'em.	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE V	Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter QUEEN, Ladies, and CORNELIUS]	999
	999
QUEEN	Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;	999
	Make haste: who has the note of them?	999
	999
First Lady	I, madam.	999
	999
QUEEN	Dispatch.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Ladies]	999
	999
	Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?	999
	999
CORNELIUS	Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:	999
	999
	[Presenting a small box]	999
	999
	But I beseech your grace, without offence,--	999
	My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have	999
	Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,	999
	Which are the movers of a languishing death;	999
	But though slow, deadly?	999
	999
QUEEN	I wonder, doctor,	999
	Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been	999
	Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how	999
	To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so	999
	That our great king himself doth woo me oft	999
	For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--	999
	Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet	999
	That I did amplify my judgment in	999
	Other conclusions? I will try the forces	999
	Of these thy compounds on such creatures as	999
	We count not worth the hanging, but none human,	999
	To try the vigour of them and apply	999
	Allayments to their act, and by them gather	999
	Their several virtues and effects.	999
	999
CORNELIUS	Your highness	999
	Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:	999
	Besides, the seeing these effects will be	999
	Both noisome and infectious.	999
	999
QUEEN	O, content thee.	999
	999
	[Enter PISANIO]	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him	999
	Will I first work: he's for his master,	999
	An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!	999
	Doctor, your service for this time is ended;	999
	Take your own way.	999
	999
CORNELIUS	[Aside]          I do suspect you, madam;	999
	But you shall do no harm.	999
	999
QUEEN	[To PISANIO]            Hark thee, a word.	999
	999
CORNELIUS	[Aside]  I do not like her. She doth think she has	999
	Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,	999
	And will not trust one of her malice with	999
	A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has	999
	Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;	999
	Which first, perchance, she'll prove on	999
	cats and dogs,	999
	Then afterward up higher: but there is	999
	No danger in what show of death it makes,	999
	More than the locking-up the spirits a time,	999
	To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd	999
	With a most false effect; and I the truer,	999
	So to be false with her.	999
	999
QUEEN	No further service, doctor,	999
	Until I send for thee.	999
	999
CORNELIUS	I humbly take my leave.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
QUEEN	Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time	999
	She will not quench and let instructions enter	999
	Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:	999
	When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,	999
	I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then	999
	As great as is thy master, greater, for	999
	His fortunes all lie speechless and his name	999
	Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor	999
	Continue where he is: to shift his being	999
	Is to exchange one misery with another,	999
	And every day that comes comes to decay	999
	A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,	999
	To be depender on a thing that leans,	999
	Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,	999
	So much as but to prop him?	999
	999
	[The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up]	999
	999
		      Thou takest up	999
	Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:	999
	It is a thing I made, which hath the king	999
	Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know	999
	What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;	999
	It is an earnest of a further good	999
	That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how	999
	The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.	999
	Think what a chance thou changest on, but think	999
	Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,	999
	Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king	999
	To any shape of thy preferment such	999
	As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,	999
	That set thee on to this desert, am bound	999
	To load thy merit richly. Call my women:	999
	Think on my words.	999
	999
	[Exit PISANIO]	999
	999
		A sly and constant knave,	999
	Not to be shaked; the agent for his master	999
	And the remembrancer of her to hold	999
	The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that	999
	Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her	999
	Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,	999
	Except she bend her humour, shall be assured	999
	To taste of too.	999
	999
	[Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies]	999
	999
	So, so: well done, well done:	999
	The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,	999
	Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;	999
	Think on my words.	999
	999
	[Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies]	999
	999
PISANIO	And shall do:	999
	But when to my good lord I prove untrue,	999
	I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.	999

	999
SCENE VI	The same. Another room in the palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter IMOGEN]	999
	999
IMOGEN	A father cruel, and a step-dame false;	999
	A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,	999
	That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!	999
	My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated	999
	Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,	999
	As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable	999
	Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,	999
	How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,	999
	Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!	999
	999
	[Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO]	999
	999
PISANIO	Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,	999
	Comes from my lord with letters.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Change you, madam?	999
	The worthy Leonatus is in safety	999
	And greets your highness dearly.	999
	999
	[Presents a letter]	999
	999
IMOGEN	Thanks, good sir:	999
	You're kindly welcome.	999
	999
IACHIMO	[Aside]  All of her that is out of door most rich!	999
	If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,	999
	She is alone the Arabian bird, and I	999
	Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!	999
	Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!	999
	Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;	999
	Rather directly fly.	999
	999
IMOGEN	[Reads]  'He is one of the noblest note, to whose	999
	kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon	999
	him accordingly, as you value your trust--	999
			 LEONATUS.'	999
	So far I read aloud:	999
	But even the very middle of my heart	999
	Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.	999
	You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I	999
	Have words to bid you, and shall find it so	999
	In all that I can do.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Thanks, fairest lady.	999
	What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes	999
	To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop	999
	Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt	999
	The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones	999
	Upon the number'd beach? and can we not	999
	Partition make with spectacles so precious	999
	'Twixt fair and foul?	999
	999
IMOGEN	What makes your admiration?	999
	999
IACHIMO	It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys	999
	'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and	999
	Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,	999
	For idiots in this case of favour would	999
	Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;	999
	Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed	999
	Should make desire vomit emptiness,	999
	Not so allured to feed.	999
	999
IMOGEN	What is the matter, trow?	999
	999
IACHIMO	The cloyed will,	999
	That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub	999
	Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb	999
	Longs after for the garbage.	999
	999
IMOGEN	What, dear sir,	999
	Thus raps you? Are you well?	999
	999
IACHIMO	Thanks, madam; well.	999
	999
	[To PISANIO]	999
	999
		 Beseech you, sir, desire	999
	My man's abode where I did leave him: he	999
	Is strange and peevish.	999
	999
PISANIO	I was going, sir,	999
	To give him welcome.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
IMOGEN	Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?	999
	999
IACHIMO	Well, madam.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there	999
	So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd	999
	The Briton reveller.	999
	999
IMOGEN	When he was here,	999
	He did incline to sadness, and oft-times	999
	Not knowing why.	999
	999
IACHIMO	                  I never saw him sad.	999
	There is a Frenchman his companion, one	999
	An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves	999
	A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces	999
	The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--	999
	Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,	999
	Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows	999
	By history, report, or his own proof,	999
	What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose	999
	But must be, will his free hours languish for	999
	Assured bondage?'	999
	999
IMOGEN	                  Will my lord say so?	999
	999
IACHIMO	Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:	999
	It is a recreation to be by	999
	And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,	999
	Some men are much to blame.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Not he, I hope.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might	999
	Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;	999
	In you, which I account his beyond all talents,	999
	Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound	999
	To pity too.	999
	999
IMOGEN	                  What do you pity, sir?	999
	999
IACHIMO	Two creatures heartily.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Am I one, sir?	999
	You look on me: what wreck discern you in me	999
	Deserves your pity?	999
	999
IACHIMO	Lamentable! What,	999
	To hide me from the radiant sun and solace	999
	I' the dungeon by a snuff?	999
	999
IMOGEN	I pray you, sir,	999
	Deliver with more openness your answers	999
	To my demands. Why do you pity me?	999
	999
IACHIMO	That others do--	999
	I was about to say--enjoy your--But	999
	It is an office of the gods to venge it,	999
	Not mine to speak on 't.	999
	999
IMOGEN	You do seem to know	999
	Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--	999
	Since doubling things go ill often hurts more	999
	Than to be sure they do; for certainties	999
	Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,	999
	The remedy then born--discover to me	999
	What both you spur and stop.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Had I this cheek	999
	To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,	999
	Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul	999
	To the oath of loyalty; this object, which	999
	Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,	999
	Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,	999
	Slaver with lips as common as the stairs	999
	That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands	999
	Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as	999
	With labour; then by-peeping in an eye	999
	Base and unlustrous as the smoky light	999
	That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit	999
	That all the plagues of hell should at one time	999
	Encounter such revolt.	999
	999
IMOGEN	My lord, I fear,	999
	Has forgot Britain.	999
	999
IACHIMO	And himself. Not I,	999
	Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce	999
	The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces	999
	That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue	999
	Charms this report out.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Let me hear no more.	999
	999
IACHIMO	O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart	999
	With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady	999
	So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,	999
	Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd	999
	With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition	999
	Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures	999
	That play with all infirmities for gold	999
	Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff	999
	As well might poison poison! Be revenged;	999
	Or she that bore you was no queen, and you	999
	Recoil from your great stock.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Revenged!	999
	How should I be revenged? If this be true,--	999
	As I have such a heart that both mine ears	999
	Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,	999
	How should I be revenged?	999
	999
IACHIMO	Should he make me	999
	Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,	999
	Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,	999
	In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.	999
	I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,	999
	More noble than that runagate to your bed,	999
	And will continue fast to your affection,	999
	Still close as sure.	999
	999
IMOGEN	What, ho, Pisanio!	999
	999
IACHIMO	Let me my service tender on your lips.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Away! I do condemn mine ears that have	999
	So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,	999
	Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not	999
	For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.	999
	Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far	999
	From thy report as thou from honour, and	999
	Solicit'st here a lady that disdains	999
	Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!	999
	The king my father shall be made acquainted	999
	Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,	999
	A saucy stranger in his court to mart	999
	As in a Romish stew and to expound	999
	His beastly mind to us, he hath a court	999
	He little cares for and a daughter who	999
	He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!	999
	999
IACHIMO	O happy Leonatus! I may say	999
	The credit that thy lady hath of thee	999
	Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness	999
	Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!	999
	A lady to the worthiest sir that ever	999
	Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only	999
	For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.	999
	I have spoke this, to know if your affiance	999
	Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,	999
	That which he is, new o'er: and he is one	999
	The truest manner'd; such a holy witch	999
	That he enchants societies into him;	999
	Half all men's hearts are his.	999
	999
IMOGEN	You make amends.	999
	999
IACHIMO	He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:	999
	He hath a kind of honour sets him off,	999
	More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,	999
	Most mighty princess, that I have adventured	999
	To try your taking a false report; which hath	999
	Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment	999
	In the election of a sir so rare,	999
	Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him	999
	Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,	999
	Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.	999
	999
IMOGEN	All's well, sir: take my power i' the court	999
	for yours.	999
	999
IACHIMO	My humble thanks. I had almost forgot	999
	To entreat your grace but in a small request,	999
	And yet of moment to, for it concerns	999
	Your lord; myself and other noble friends,	999
	Are partners in the business.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Pray, what is't?	999
	999
IACHIMO	Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--	999
	The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums	999
	To buy a present for the emperor	999
	Which I, the factor for the rest, have done	999
	In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels	999
	Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;	999
	And I am something curious, being strange,	999
	To have them in safe stowage: may it please you	999
	To take them in protection?	999
	999
IMOGEN	Willingly;	999
	And pawn mine honour for their safety: since	999
	My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them	999
	In my bedchamber.	999
	999
IACHIMO	They are in a trunk,	999
	Attended by my men: I will make bold	999
	To send them to you, only for this night;	999
	I must aboard to-morrow.	999
	999
IMOGEN	O, no, no.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word	999
	By lengthening my return. From Gallia	999
	I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise	999
	To see your grace.	999
	999
IMOGEN	I thank you for your pains:	999
	But not away to-morrow!	999
	999
IACHIMO	O, I must, madam:	999
	Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please	999
	To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:	999
	I have outstood my time; which is material	999
	To the tender of our present.	999
	999
IMOGEN	I will write.	999
	Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,	999
	And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.	999

	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CLOTEN and two Lords]	999
	999
CLOTEN	Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the	999
	jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a	999
	hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes	999
	must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine	999
	oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.	999
	999
First Lord	What got he by that? You have broke his pate with	999
	your bowl.	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside]  If his wit had been like him that broke it,	999
	it would have run all out.	999
	999
CLOTEN	When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for	999
	any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?	999
	999
Second Lord	No my lord;	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	nor crop the ears of them.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?	999
	Would he had been one of my rank!	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside]  To have smelt like a fool.	999
	999
CLOTEN	I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a	999
	pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;	999
	they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my	999
	mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of	999
	fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that	999
	nobody can match.	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside]  You are cock and capon too; and you crow,	999
	cock, with your comb on.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Sayest thou?	999
	999
Second Lord	It is not fit your lordship should undertake every	999
	companion that you give offence to.	999
	999
CLOTEN	No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit	999
	offence to my inferiors.	999
	999
Second Lord	Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Why, so I say.	999
	999
First Lord	Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?	999
	999
CLOTEN	A stranger, and I not know on't!	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside]  He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it	999
	not.	999
	999
First Lord	There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of	999
	Leonatus' friends.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,	999
	whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?	999
	999
First Lord	One of your lordship's pages.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no	999
	derogation in't?	999
	999
Second Lord	You cannot derogate, my lord.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Not easily, I think.	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside]  You are a fool granted; therefore your	999
	issues, being foolish, do not derogate.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost	999
	to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.	999
	999
Second Lord	I'll attend your lordship.	999
	999
	[Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord]	999
	999
	That such a crafty devil as is his mother	999
	Should yield the world this ass! a woman that	999
	Bears all down with her brain; and this her son	999
	Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,	999
	And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,	999
	Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,	999
	Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,	999
	A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer	999
	More hateful than the foul expulsion is	999
	Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act	999
	Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm	999
	The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked	999
	That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,	999
	To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!	999

ACT II	999

	999
SCENE II	Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace:	999
	a trunk in one corner of it.	999
	999
	999
	[IMOGEN in bed, reading; a Lady attending]	999
	999
IMOGEN	Who's there? my woman Helen?	999
	999
Lady	Please you, madam	999
	999
IMOGEN	What hour is it?	999
	999
Lady	                  Almost midnight, madam.	999
	999
IMOGEN	I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:	999
	Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:	999
	Take not away the taper, leave it burning;	999
	And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,	999
	I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly	999
	999
	[Exit Lady]	999
	999
	To your protection I commend me, gods.	999
	From fairies and the tempters of the night	999
	Guard me, beseech ye.	999
	999
	[Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk]	999
	999
IACHIMO	The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense	999
	Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus	999
	Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd	999
	The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,	999
	How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,	999
	And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!	999
	But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,	999
	How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that	999
	Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper	999
	Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,	999
	To see the enclosed lights, now canopied	999
	Under these windows, white and azure laced	999
	With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,	999
	To note the chamber: I will write all down:	999
	Such and such pictures; there the window; such	999
	The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,	999
	Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.	999
	Ah, but some natural notes about her body,	999
	Above ten thousand meaner moveables	999
	Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.	999
	O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!	999
	And be her sense but as a monument,	999
	Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:	999
	999
	[Taking off her bracelet]	999
	999
	As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!	999
	'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,	999
	As strongly as the conscience does within,	999
	To the madding of her lord. On her left breast	999
	A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops	999
	I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,	999
	Stronger than ever law could make: this secret	999
	Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en	999
	The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?	999
	Why should I write this down, that's riveted,	999
	Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late	999
	The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down	999
	Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:	999
	To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.	999
	Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning	999
	May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;	999
	Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.	999
	999
	[Clock strikes]	999
	999
	One, two, three: time, time!	999

	999
	999
	[Enter CLOTEN and Lords]	999
	999
First Lord	Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the	999
	most coldest that ever turned up ace.	999
	999
CLOTEN	It would make any man cold to lose.	999
	999
First Lord	But not every man patient after the noble temper of	999
	your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Winning will put any man into courage. If I could	999
	get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough.	999
	It's almost morning, is't not?	999
	999
First Lord	Day, my lord.	999
	999
CLOTEN	I would this music would come: I am advised to give	999
	her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.	999
	999
	[Enter Musicians]	999
	999
	Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with your	999
	fingering, so; we'll try with tongue too: if none	999
	will do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er.	999
	First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;	999
	after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich	999
	words to it: and then let her consider.	999
	[SONG]	999
	999
	Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,	999
	And Phoebus 'gins arise,	999
	His steeds to water at those springs	999
	On chaliced flowers that lies;	999
	And winking Mary-buds begin	999
	To ope their golden eyes:	999
	With every thing that pretty is,	999
	My lady sweet, arise:	999
	Arise, arise.	999
	999
CLOTEN	So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will	999
	consider your music the better: if it do not, it is	999
	a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and	999
	calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to	999
	boot, can never amend.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Musicians]	999
	999
Second Lord	Here comes the king.	999
	999
CLOTEN	I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason I	999
	was up so early: he cannot choose but take this	999
	service I have done fatherly.	999
	999
	[Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN]	999
	999
	Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?	999
	Will she not forth?	999
	999
CLOTEN	I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	The exile of her minion is too new;	999
	She hath not yet forgot him: some more time	999
	Must wear the print of his remembrance out,	999
	And then she's yours.	999
	999
QUEEN	You are most bound to the king,	999
	Who lets go by no vantages that may	999
	Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself	999
	To orderly soliciting, and be friended	999
	With aptness of the season; make denials	999
	Increase your services; so seem as if	999
	You were inspired to do those duties which	999
	You tender to her; that you in all obey her,	999
	Save when command to your dismission tends,	999
	And therein you are senseless.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Senseless! not so.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;	999
	The one is Caius Lucius.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	A worthy fellow,	999
	Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;	999
	But that's no fault of his: we must receive him	999
	According to the honour of his sender;	999
	And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,	999
	We must extend our notice. Our dear son,	999
	When you have given good morning to your mistress,	999
	Attend the queen and us; we shall have need	999
	To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but CLOTEN]	999
	999
CLOTEN	If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,	999
	Let her lie still and dream.	999
	999
	[Knocks]	999
	999
		       By your leave, ho!	999
	I Know her women are about her: what	999
	If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold	999
	Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makes	999
	Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up	999
	Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold	999
	Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;	999
	Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what	999
	Can it not do and undo? I will make	999
	One of her women lawyer to me, for	999
	I yet not understand the case myself.	999
	999
	[Knocks]	999
	999
	By your leave.	999
	999
	[Enter a Lady]	999
	999
Lady	Who's there that knocks?	999
	999
CLOTEN	A gentleman.	999
	999
Lady	No more?	999
	999
CLOTEN	Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.	999
	999
Lady	That's more	999
	Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,	999
	Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?	999
	999
CLOTEN	Your lady's person: is she ready?	999
	999
Lady	Ay,	999
	To keep her chamber.	999
	999
CLOTEN	There is gold for you;	999
	Sell me your good report.	999
	999
Lady	How! my good name? or to report of you	999
	What I shall think is good?--The princess!	999
	999
	[Enter IMOGEN]	999
	999
CLOTEN	Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.	999
	999
	[Exit Lady]	999
	999
IMOGEN	Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains	999
	For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give	999
	Is telling you that I am poor of thanks	999
	And scarce can spare them.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Still, I swear I love you.	999
	999
IMOGEN	If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:	999
	If you swear still, your recompense is still	999
	That I regard it not.	999
	999
CLOTEN	This is no answer.	999
	999
IMOGEN	But that you shall not say I yield being silent,	999
	I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,	999
	I shall unfold equal discourtesy	999
	To your best kindness: one of your great knowing	999
	Should learn, being taught, forbearance.	999
	999
CLOTEN	To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:	999
	I will not.	999
	999
IMOGEN	          Fools are not mad folks.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Do you call me fool?	999
	999
IMOGEN	As I am mad, I do:	999
	If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;	999
	That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,	999
	You put me to forget a lady's manners,	999
	By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,	999
	That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,	999
	By the very truth of it, I care not for you,	999
	And am so near the lack of charity--	999
	To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather	999
	You felt than make't my boast.	999
	999
CLOTEN	You sin against	999
	Obedience, which you owe your father. For	999
	The contract you pretend with that base wretch,	999
	One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,	999
	With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:	999
	And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--	999
	Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,	999
	On whom there is no more dependency	999
	But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;	999
	Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by	999
	The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil	999
	The precious note of it with a base slave.	999
	A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,	999
	A pantler, not so eminent.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Profane fellow	999
	Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more	999
	But what thou art besides, thou wert too base	999
	To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,	999
	Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made	999
	Comparative for your virtues, to be styled	999
	The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated	999
	For being preferred so well.	999
	999
CLOTEN	The south-fog rot him!	999
	999
IMOGEN	He never can meet more mischance than come	999
	To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,	999
	That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer	999
	In my respect than all the hairs above thee,	999
	Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!	999
	999
	[Enter PISANIO]	999
	999
CLOTEN	'His garment!' Now the devil--	999
	999
IMOGEN	To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--	999
	999
CLOTEN	'His garment!'	999
	999
IMOGEN	                  I am sprited with a fool.	999
	Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman	999
	Search for a jewel that too casually	999
	Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,	999
	If I would lose it for a revenue	999
	Of any king's in Europe. I do think	999
	I saw't this morning: confident I am	999
	Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:	999
	I hope it be not gone to tell my lord	999
	That I kiss aught but he.	999
	999
PISANIO	'Twill not be lost.	999
	999
IMOGEN	I hope so: go and search.	999
	999
	[Exit PISANIO]	999
	999
CLOTEN	You have abused me:	999
	'His meanest garment!'	999
	999
IMOGEN	Ay, I said so, sir:	999
	If you will make't an action, call witness to't.	999
	999
CLOTEN	I will inform your father.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Your mother too:	999
	She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,	999
	But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,	999
	To the worst of discontent.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CLOTEN	I'll be revenged:	999
	'His meanest garment!' Well.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE IV	Rome. Philario's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO]	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure	999
	To win the king as I am bold her honour	999
	Will remain hers.	999
	999
PHILARIO	                  What means do you make to him?	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Not any, but abide the change of time,	999
	Quake in the present winter's state and wish	999
	That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,	999
	I barely gratify your love; they failing,	999
	I must die much your debtor.	999
	999
PHILARIO	Your very goodness and your company	999
	O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king	999
	Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius	999
	Will do's commission throughly: and I think	999
	He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,	999
	Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance	999
	Is yet fresh in their grief.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I do believe,	999
	Statist though I am none, nor like to be,	999
	That this will prove a war; and you shall hear	999
	The legions now in Gallia sooner landed	999
	In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings	999
	Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen	999
	Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar	999
	Smiled at their lack of skill, but found	999
	their courage	999
	Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,	999
	Now mingled with their courages, will make known	999
	To their approvers they are people such	999
	That mend upon the world.	999
	999
	[Enter IACHIMO]	999
	999
PHILARIO	See! Iachimo!	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	The swiftest harts have posted you by land;	999
	And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,	999
	To make your vessel nimble.	999
	999
PHILARIO	Welcome, sir.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I hope the briefness of your answer made	999
	The speediness of your return.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Your lady	999
	Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	And therewithal the best; or let her beauty	999
	Look through a casement to allure false hearts	999
	And be false with them.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Here are letters for you.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Their tenor good, I trust.	999
	999
IACHIMO	'Tis very like.	999
	999
PHILARIO	Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court	999
	When you were there?	999
	999
IACHIMO	He was expected then,	999
	But not approach'd.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	All is well yet.	999
	Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not	999
	Too dull for your good wearing?	999
	999
IACHIMO	If I had lost it,	999
	I should have lost the worth of it in gold.	999
	I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy	999
	A second night of such sweet shortness which	999
	Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	The stone's too hard to come by.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Not a whit,	999
	Your lady being so easy.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Make not, sir,	999
	Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we	999
	Must not continue friends.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Good sir, we must,	999
	If you keep covenant. Had I not brought	999
	The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant	999
	We were to question further: but I now	999
	Profess myself the winner of her honour,	999
	Together with your ring; and not the wronger	999
	Of her or you, having proceeded but	999
	By both your wills.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	If you can make't apparent	999
	That you have tasted her in bed, my hand	999
	And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion	999
	You had of her pure honour gains or loses	999
	Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both	999
	To who shall find them.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Sir, my circumstances,	999
	Being so near the truth as I will make them,	999
	Must first induce you to believe: whose strength	999
	I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,	999
	You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find	999
	You need it not.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	                  Proceed.	999
	999
IACHIMO	First, her bedchamber,--	999
	Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess	999
	Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd	999
	With tapesty of silk and silver; the story	999
	Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,	999
	And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for	999
	The press of boats or pride: a piece of work	999
	So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive	999
	In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd	999
	Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,	999
	Since the true life on't was--	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	This is true;	999
	And this you might have heard of here, by me,	999
	Or by some other.	999
	999
IACHIMO	More particulars	999
	Must justify my knowledge.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	So they must,	999
	Or do your honour injury.	999
	999
IACHIMO	The chimney	999
	Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece	999
	Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures	999
	So likely to report themselves: the cutter	999
	Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,	999
	Motion and breath left out.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	This is a thing	999
	Which you might from relation likewise reap,	999
	Being, as it is, much spoke of.	999
	999
IACHIMO	The roof o' the chamber	999
	With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--	999
	I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids	999
	Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely	999
	Depending on their brands.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	This is her honour!	999
	Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise	999
	Be given to your remembrance--the description	999
	Of what is in her chamber nothing saves	999
	The wager you have laid.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Then, if you can,	999
	999
	[Showing the bracelet]	999
	999
	Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!	999
	And now 'tis up again: it must be married	999
	To that your diamond; I'll keep them.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Jove!	999
	Once more let me behold it: is it that	999
	Which I left with her?	999
	999
IACHIMO	Sir--I thank her--that:	999
	She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;	999
	Her pretty action did outsell her gift,	999
	And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said	999
	She prized it once.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	May be she pluck'd it off	999
	To send it me.	999
	999
IACHIMO	She writes so to you, doth she?	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;	999
	999
	[Gives the ring]	999
	999
	It is a basilisk unto mine eye,	999
	Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour	999
	Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,	999
	Where there's another man: the vows of women	999
	Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,	999
	Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.	999
	O, above measure false!	999
	999
PHILARIO	Have patience, sir,	999
	And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:	999
	It may be probable she lost it; or	999
	Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,	999
	Hath stol'n it from her?	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Very true;	999
	And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:	999
	Render to me some corporal sign about her,	999
	More evident than this; for this was stolen.	999
	999
IACHIMO	By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.	999
	'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure	999
	She would not lose it: her attendants are	999
	All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!	999
	And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:	999
	The cognizance of her incontinency	999
	Is this: she hath bought the name of whore	999
	thus dearly.	999
	There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell	999
	Divide themselves between you!	999
	999
PHILARIO	Sir, be patient:	999
	This is not strong enough to be believed	999
	Of one persuaded well of--	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Never talk on't;	999
	She hath been colted by him.	999
	999
IACHIMO	If you seek	999
	For further satisfying, under her breast--	999
	Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud	999
	Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,	999
	I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger	999
	To feed again, though full. You do remember	999
	This stain upon her?	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Ay, and it doth confirm	999
	Another stain, as big as hell can hold,	999
	Were there no more but it.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Will you hear more?	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;	999
	Once, and a million!	999
	999
IACHIMO	I'll be sworn--	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	No swearing.	999
	If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;	999
	And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny	999
	Thou'st made me cuckold.	999
	999
IACHIMO	I'll deny nothing.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!	999
	I will go there and do't, i' the court, before	999
	Her father. I'll do something--	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PHILARIO	Quite besides	999
	The government of patience! You have won:	999
	Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath	999
	He hath against himself.	999
	999
IACHIMO	With an my heart.	999

SCENE V	Another room in Philario's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS]	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Is there no way for men to be but women	999
	Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;	999
	And that most venerable man which I	999
	Did call my father, was I know not where	999
	When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools	999
	Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd	999
	The Dian of that time so doth my wife	999
	The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!	999
	Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd	999
	And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with	999
	A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't	999
	Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her	999
	As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!	999
	This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--wast not?--	999
	Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,	999
	Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,	999
	Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition	999
	But what he look'd for should oppose and she	999
	Should from encounter guard. Could I find out	999
	The woman's part in me! For there's no motion	999
	That tends to vice in man, but I affirm	999
	It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,	999
	The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;	999
	Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;	999
	Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,	999
	Nice longing, slanders, mutability,	999
	All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,	999
	Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;	999
	For even to vice	999
	They are not constant but are changing still	999
	One vice, but of a minute old, for one	999
	Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,	999
	Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill	999
	In a true hate, to pray they have their will:	999
	The very devils cannot plague them better.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN,	999
	and Lords at one door, and at another,	999
	CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants]	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet	999
	Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues	999
	Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain	999
	And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--	999
	Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less	999
	Than in his feats deserving it--for him	999
	And his succession granted Rome a tribute,	999
	Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately	999
	Is left untender'd.	999
	999
QUEEN	And, to kill the marvel,	999
	Shall be so ever.	999
	999
CLOTEN	There be many Caesars,	999
	Ere such another Julius. Britain is	999
	A world by itself; and we will nothing pay	999
	For wearing our own noses.	999
	999
QUEEN	That opportunity	999
	Which then they had to take from 's, to resume	999
	We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,	999
	The kings your ancestors, together with	999
	The natural bravery of your isle, which stands	999
	As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in	999
	With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,	999
	With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,	999
	But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest	999
	Caesar made here; but made not here his brag	999
	Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--	999
	That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried	999
	From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--	999
	Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,	999
	Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd	999
	As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof	999
	The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--	999
	O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,	999
	Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright	999
	And Britons strut with courage.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our	999
	kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,	999
	as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of	999
	them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such	999
	straight arms, none.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Son, let your mother end.	999
	999
CLOTEN	We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as	999
	Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a	999
	hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If	999
	Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or	999
	put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute	999
	for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	You must know,	999
	Till the injurious Romans did extort	999
	This tribute from us, we were free:	999
	Caesar's ambition,	999
	Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch	999
	The sides o' the world, against all colour here	999
	Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off	999
	Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon	999
	Ourselves to be.	999
	999
CLOTEN	|	999
	|                We do.	999
Lords	|	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Say, then, to Caesar,	999
	Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which	999
	Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar	999
	Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise	999
	Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,	999
	Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,	999
	Who was the first of Britain which did put	999
	His brows within a golden crown and call'd	999
	Himself a king.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	                  I am sorry, Cymbeline,	999
	That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--	999
	Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than	999
	Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:	999
	Receive it from me, then: war and confusion	999
	In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look	999
	For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,	999
	I thank thee for myself.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Thou art welcome, Caius.	999
	Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent	999
	Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;	999
	Which he to seek of me again, perforce,	999
	Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect	999
	That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for	999
	Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent	999
	Which not to read would show the Britons cold:	999

CAIUS LUCIUS	Let proof speak.	999
	999
CLOTEN	His majesty bids you welcome. Make	999
	pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if	999
	you seek us afterwards in other terms, you	999
	shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you	999
	beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in	999
	the adventure, our crows shall fare the better	999
	for you; and there's an end.	999

	999
	[Enter PISANIO, with a letter]	999
	999
PISANIO	How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not	999
	What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,	999
	O master! what a strange infection	999
	Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,	999
	As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd	999
	On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:	999
	She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,	999
	More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults	999
	As would take in some virtue. O my master!	999
	Thy mind to her is now as low as were	999
	Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?	999
	Upon the love and truth and vows which I	999
	Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?	999
	If it be so to do good service, never	999
	Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,	999
	That I should seem to lack humanity	999
	so much as this fact comes to?	999
	999
	[Reading]	999
	999
		'Do't: the letter	999
	that I have sent her, by her own command	999
	Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!	999
	Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,	999
	Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st	999
	So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.	999
	I am ignorant in what I am commanded.	999
	999
	[Enter IMOGEN]	999
	999
IMOGEN	How now, Pisanio!	999
	999
PISANIO	Madam, here is a letter from my lord.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!	999
	O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer	999
	That knew the stars as I his characters;	999
	He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,	999
	Let what is here contain'd relish of love,	999
	Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not	999
	That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:	999
	Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,	999
	For it doth physic love: of his content,	999
	All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be	999
	You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers	999
	And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:	999
	Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet	999
	You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me	999
	in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as	999
	you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me	999
	with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,	999
	at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out of	999
	this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all	999
	happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your,	999
	increasing in love,	999
		        LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'	999
	O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?	999
	He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me	999
	How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs	999
	May plod it in a week, why may not I	999
	Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--	999
	Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,--	999
	let me bate,-but not like me--yet long'st,	999
	But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;	999
	For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;	999
	Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,	999
	To the smothering of the sense--how far it is	999
	To this same blessed Milford: and by the way	999
	Tell me how Wales was made so happy as	999
	To inherit such a haven: but first of all,	999
	How we may steal from hence, and for the gap	999
	That we shall make in time, from our hence-going	999
	And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:	999
	Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?	999
	We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,	999
	How many score of miles may we well ride	999
	'Twixt hour and hour?	999
	999
PISANIO	One score 'twixt sun and sun,	999
	Madam, 's enough for you:	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
		     and too much too.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Why, one that rode to's execution, man,	999
	Could never go so slow: I have heard of	999
	riding wagers,	999
	Where horses have been nimbler than the sands	999
	That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:	999
	Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say	999
	She'll home to her father: and provide me presently	999
	A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit	999
	A franklin's housewife.	999
	999
PISANIO	Madam, you're best consider.	999
	999
IMOGEN	I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,	999
	Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,	999
	That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;	999
	Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,	999
	Accessible is none but Milford way.	999

	999
SCENE III	Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS; GUIDERIUS,	999
	and ARVIRAGUS following]	999
	999
BELARIUS	A goodly day not to keep house, with such	999
	Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate	999
	Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you	999
	To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs	999
	Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through	999
	And keep their impious turbans on, without	999
	Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!	999
	We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly	999
	As prouder livers do.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Hail, heaven!	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Hail, heaven!	999
	999
BELARIUS	Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;	999
	Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,	999
	When you above perceive me like a crow,	999
	That it is place which lessens and sets off;	999
	And you may then revolve what tales I have told you	999
	Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:	999
	This service is not service, so being done,	999
	But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,	999
	Draws us a profit from all things we see;	999
	And often, to our comfort, shall we find	999
	The sharded beetle in a safer hold	999
	Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life	999
	Is nobler than attending for a cheque,	999
	Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,	999
	Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:	999
	Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,	999
	Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,	999
	Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not	999
	What air's from home. Haply this life is best,	999
	If quiet life be best; sweeter to you	999
	That have a sharper known; well corresponding	999
	With your stiff age: but unto us it is	999
	A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;	999
	A prison for a debtor, that not dares	999
	To stride a limit.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	                  What should we speak of	999
	When we are old as you? when we shall hear	999
	The rain and wind beat dark December, how,	999
	In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse	999
	The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;	999
	We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,	999
	Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;	999
	Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage	999
	We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,	999
	And sing our bondage freely.	999
	999
BELARIUS	How you speak!	999
	Did you but know the city's usuries	999
	And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court	999
	As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb	999
	Is certain falling, or so slippery that	999
	The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,	999
	A pain that only seems to seek out danger	999
	I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'	999
	the search,	999
	And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph	999
	As record of fair act; nay, many times,	999
	Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,	999
	Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story	999
	The world may read in me: my body's mark'd	999
	With Roman swords, and my report was once	999
	First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,	999
	And when a soldier was the theme, my name	999
	Was not far off: then was I as a tree	999
	Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,	999
	A storm or robbery, call it what you will,	999
	Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,	999
	And left me bare to weather.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Uncertain favour!	999
	999
BELARIUS	My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--	999
	But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd	999
	Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline	999
	I was confederate with the Romans: so	999
	Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years	999
	This rock and these demesnes have been my world;	999
	Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid	999
	More pious debts to heaven than in all	999
	The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!	999
	This is not hunters' language: he that strikes	999
	The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;	999
	To him the other two shall minister;	999
	And we will fear no poison, which attends	999
	In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.	999
	999
	[Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]	999
	999
	How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!	999
	These boys know little they are sons to the king;	999
	Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.	999
	They think they are mine; and though train'd	999
	up thus meanly	999
	I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit	999
	The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them	999
	In simple and low things to prince it much	999
	Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,	999
	The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who	999
	The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!	999
	When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell	999
	The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out	999
	Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,	999
	And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then	999
	The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,	999
	Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture	999
	That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,	999
	Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,	999
	Strikes life into my speech and shows much more	999
	His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!	999
	O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows	999
	Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,	999
	At three and two years old, I stole these babes;	999
	Thinking to bar thee of succession, as	999
	Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,	999
	Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for	999
	their mother,	999
	And every day do honour to her grave:	999
	Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,	999
	They take for natural father. The game is up.	999

SCENE IV	Country near Milford-Haven.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN]	999
	999
IMOGEN	Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place	999
	Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so	999
	To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!	999
	Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,	999
	That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh	999
	From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,	999
	Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd	999
	Beyond self-explication: put thyself	999
	Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness	999
	Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?	999
	Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with	999
	A look untender? If't be summer news,	999
	Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st	999
	But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!	999
	That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,	999
	And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue	999
	May take off some extremity, which to read	999
	Would be even mortal to me.	999
	999
PISANIO	Please you, read;	999
	And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing	999
	The most disdain'd of fortune.	999
	999
IMOGEN	[Reads]  'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the	999
	strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie	999
	bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,	999
	but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain	999
	as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,	999
	must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with	999
	the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away	999
	her life: I shall give thee opportunity at	999
	Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose	999
	where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain	999
	it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and	999
	equally to me disloyal.'	999
	999
PISANIO	What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper	999
	Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,	999
	Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue	999
	Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath	999
	Rides on the posting winds and doth belie	999
	All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,	999
	Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave	999
	This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?	999
	999
IMOGEN	False to his bed! What is it to be false?	999
	To lie in watch there and to think on him?	999
	To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep	999
	charge nature,	999
	To break it with a fearful dream of him	999
	And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?	999
	999
PISANIO	Alas, good lady!	999
	999
IMOGEN	I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,	999
	Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;	999
	Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks	999
	Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy	999
	Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:	999
	Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;	999
	And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,	999
	I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,	999
	Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,	999
	By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought	999
	Put on for villany; not born where't grows,	999
	But worn a bait for ladies.	999
	999
PISANIO	Good madam, hear me.	999
	999
IMOGEN	True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,	999
	Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping	999
	Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity	999
	From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,	999
	Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;	999
	Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured	999
	From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:	999
	Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,	999
	A little witness my obedience: look!	999
	I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit	999
	The innocent mansion of my love, my heart;	999
	Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;	999
	Thy master is not there, who was indeed	999
	The riches of it: do his bidding; strike	999
	Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;	999
	But now thou seem'st a coward.	999
	999
PISANIO	Hence, vile instrument!	999
	Thou shalt not damn my hand.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Why, I must die;	999
	And if I do not by thy hand, thou art	999
	No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter	999
	There is a prohibition so divine	999
	That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.	999
	Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;	999
	Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?	999
	The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,	999
	All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,	999
	Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more	999
	Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools	999
	Believe false teachers: though those that	999
	are betray'd	999
	Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor	999
	Stands in worse case of woe.	999
	And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up	999
	My disobedience 'gainst the king my father	999
	And make me put into contempt the suits	999
	Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find	999
	It is no act of common passage, but	999
	A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself	999
	To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her	999
	That now thou tirest on, how thy memory	999
	Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:	999
	The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?	999
	Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,	999
	When I desire it too.	999
	999
PISANIO	O gracious lady,	999
	Since I received command to do this business	999
	I have not slept one wink.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Do't, and to bed then.	999
	999
PISANIO	I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Wherefore then	999
	Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused	999
	So many miles with a pretence? this place?	999
	Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?	999
	The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,	999
	For my being absent? whereunto I never	999
	Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,	999
	To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,	999
	The elected deer before thee?	999
	999
PISANIO	But to win time	999
	To lose so bad employment; in the which	999
	I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,	999
	Hear me with patience.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Talk thy tongue weary; speak	999
	I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear	999
	Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,	999
	Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.	999
	999
PISANIO	Then, madam,	999
	I thought you would not back again.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Most like;	999
	Bringing me here to kill me.	999
	999
PISANIO	Not so, neither:	999
	But if I were as wise as honest, then	999
	My purpose would prove well. It cannot be	999
	But that my master is abused:	999
	Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.	999
	Hath done you both this cursed injury.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Some Roman courtezan.	999
	999
PISANIO	No, on my life.	999
	I'll give but notice you are dead and send him	999
	Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded	999
	I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,	999
	And that will well confirm it.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Why good fellow,	999
	What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?	999
	Or in my life what comfort, when I am	999
	Dead to my husband?	999
	999
PISANIO	If you'll back to the court--	999
	999
IMOGEN	No court, no father; nor no more ado	999
	With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,	999
	That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me	999
	As fearful as a siege.	999
	999
PISANIO	If not at court,	999
	Then not in Britain must you bide.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Where then	999
	Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,	999
	Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume	999
	Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;	999
	In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think	999
	There's livers out of Britain.	999
	999
PISANIO	I am most glad	999
	You think of other place. The ambassador,	999
	Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven	999
	To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind	999
	Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise	999
	That which, to appear itself, must not yet be	999
	But by self-danger, you should tread a course	999
	Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near	999
	The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least	999
	That though his actions were not visible, yet	999
	Report should render him hourly to your ear	999
	As truly as he moves.	999
	999
IMOGEN	O, for such means!	999
	Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,	999
	I would adventure.	999
	999
PISANIO	Well, then, here's the point:	999
	You must forget to be a woman; change	999
	Command into obedience: fear and niceness--	999
	The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,	999
	Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:	999
	Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and	999
	As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must	999
	Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,	999
	Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!	999
	Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch	999
	Of common-kissing Titan, and forget	999
	Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein	999
	You made great Juno angry.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Nay, be brief	999
	I see into thy end, and am almost	999
	A man already.	999
	999
PISANIO	First, make yourself but like one.	999
	Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--	999
	'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all	999
	That answer to them: would you in their serving,	999
	And with what imitation you can borrow	999
	From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius	999
	Present yourself, desire his service, tell him	999
	wherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,	999
	If that his head have ear in music,--doubtless	999
	With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable	999
	And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,	999
	You have me, rich; and I will never fail	999
	Beginning nor supplyment.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Thou art all the comfort	999
	The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:	999
	There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even	999
	All that good time will give us: this attempt	999
	I am soldier to, and will abide it with	999
	A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.	999
	999
PISANIO	Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,	999
	Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of	999
	Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,	999
	Here is a box; I had it from the queen:	999
	What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,	999
	Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this	999
	Will drive away distemper. To some shade,	999
	And fit you to your manhood. May the gods	999
	Direct you to the best!	999
	999
IMOGEN	Amen: I thank thee.	999

ACT III	999

	999
	999
SCENE V	A room in Cymbeline's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS,	999
	Lords, and Attendants]	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Thus far; and so farewell.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	Thanks, royal sir.	999
	My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;	999
	And am right sorry that I must report ye	999
	My master's enemy.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	                  Our subjects, sir,	999
	Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself	999
	To show less sovereignty than they, must needs	999
	Appear unkinglike.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	                  So, sir: I desire of you	999
	A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.	999
	Madam, all joy befal your grace!	999
	999
QUEEN	And you!	999
	999
CYMBELINE	My lords, you are appointed for that office;	999
	The due of honour in no point omit.	999
	So farewell, noble Lucius.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	Your hand, my lord.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Receive it friendly; but from this time forth	999
	I wear it as your enemy.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	Sir, the event	999
	Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,	999
	Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!	999
	999
	[Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords]	999
	999
QUEEN	He goes hence frowning: but it honours us	999
	That we have given him cause.	999
	999
CLOTEN	'Tis all the better;	999
	Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor	999
	How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely	999
	Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:	999
	The powers that he already hath in Gallia	999
	Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves	999
	His war for Britain.	999
	999
QUEEN	'Tis not sleepy business;	999
	But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Our expectation that it would be thus	999
	Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,	999
	Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd	999
	Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd	999
	The duty of the day: she looks us like	999
	A thing more made of malice than of duty:	999
	We have noted it. Call her before us; for	999
	We have been too slight in sufferance.	999
	999
	[Exit an Attendant]	999
	999
QUEEN	Royal sir,	999
	Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired	999
	Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,	999
	'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,	999
	Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady	999
	So tender of rebukes that words are strokes	999
	And strokes death to her.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Attendant]	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Where is she, sir? How	999
	Can her contempt be answer'd?	999
	999
Attendant	Please you, sir,	999
	Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer	999
	That will be given to the loudest noise we make.	999
	999
QUEEN	My lord, when last I went to visit her,	999
	She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,	999
	Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,	999
	She should that duty leave unpaid to you,	999
	Which daily she was bound to proffer: this	999
	She wish'd me to make known; but our great court	999
	Made me to blame in memory.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Her doors lock'd?	999
	Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear	999
	Prove false!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
QUEEN	Son, I say, follow the king.	999
	999
CLOTEN	That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,	999
	have not seen these two days.	999
	999
QUEEN	Go, look after.	999
	999
	[Exit CLOTEN]	999
	999
	Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!	999
	He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence	999
	Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes	999
	It is a thing most precious. But for her,	999
	Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,	999
	Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown	999
	To her desired Posthumus: gone she is	999
	To death or to dishonour; and my end	999
	Can make good use of either: she being down,	999
	I have the placing of the British crown.	999
	999
	[Re-enter CLOTEN]	999
	999
	How now, my son!	999
	999
CLOTEN	'Tis certain she is fled.	999
	Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none	999
	Dare come about him.	999
	999
QUEEN	[Aside]            All the better: may	999
	This night forestall him of the coming day!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CLOTEN	I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,	999
	And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite	999
	Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one	999
	The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,	999
	Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but	999
	Disdaining me and throwing favours on	999
	The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment	999
	That what's else rare is choked; and in that point	999
	I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,	999
	To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--	999
	999
	[Enter PISANIO]	999
	999
	Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?	999
	Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,	999
	Where is thy lady? In a word; or else	999
	Thou art straightway with the fiends.	999
	999
PISANIO	O, good my lord!	999
	999
CLOTEN	Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,--	999
	I will not ask again. Close villain,	999
	I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip	999
	Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?	999
	From whose so many weights of baseness cannot	999
	A dram of worth be drawn.	999
	999
PISANIO	Alas, my lord,	999
	How can she be with him? When was she missed?	999
	He is in Rome.	999
	999
CLOTEN	                  Where is she, sir? Come nearer;	999
	No further halting: satisfy me home	999
	What is become of her.	999
	999
PISANIO	O, my all-worthy lord!	999
	999
CLOTEN	All-worthy villain!	999
	Discover where thy mistress is at once,	999
	At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'	999
	Speak, or thy silence on the instant is	999
	Thy condemnation and thy death.	999
	999
PISANIO	Then, sir,	999
	This paper is the history of my knowledge	999
	Touching her flight.	999
	999
	[Presenting a letter]	999
	999
CLOTEN	Let's see't. I will pursue her	999
	Even to Augustus' throne.	999
	999
PISANIO	[Aside]                 Or this, or perish.	999
	She's far enough; and what he learns by this	999
	May prove his travel, not her danger.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Hum!	999
	999
PISANIO	[Aside]  I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,	999
	Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!	999
	999
CLOTEN	Sirrah, is this letter true?	999
	999
PISANIO	Sir, as I think.	999
	999
CLOTEN	It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou	999
	wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,	999
	undergo those employments wherein I should have	999
	cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,	999
	what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it	999
	directly and truly, I would think thee an honest	999
	man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy	999
	relief nor my voice for thy preferment.	999
	999
PISANIO	Well, my good lord.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and	999
	constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of	999
	that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the	999
	course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of	999
	mine: wilt thou serve me?	999
	999
PISANIO	Sir, I will.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy	999
	late master's garments in thy possession?	999
	999
PISANIO	I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he	999
	wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.	999
	999
CLOTEN	The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit	999
	hither: let it be thy lint service; go.	999
	999
PISANIO	I shall, my lord.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CLOTEN	Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one	999
	thing; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thou	999
	villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these	999
	garments were come. She said upon a time--the	999
	bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she	999
	held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect	999
	than my noble and natural person together with the	999
	adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my	999
	back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her	999
	eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then	999
	be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my	999
	speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and	999
	when my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vex	999
	her I will execute in the clothes that she so	999
	praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot	999
	her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,	999
	and I'll be merry in my revenge.	999
	999
	[Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes]	999
	999
	Be those the garments?	999
	999
PISANIO	Ay, my noble lord.	999
	999
CLOTEN	How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?	999
	999
PISANIO	She can scarce be there yet.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second	999
	thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,	999
	that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be	999
	but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself	999
	to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had	999
	wings to follow it! Come, and be true.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PISANIO	Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee	999
	Were to prove false, which I will never be,	999
	To him that is most true. To Milford go,	999
	And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,	999
	You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed	999
	Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!	999

SCENE VI	Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter IMOGEN, in boy's clothes]	999
	999
IMOGEN	I see a man's life is a tedious one:	999
	I have tired myself, and for two nights together	999
	Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,	999
	But that my resolution helps me. Milford,	999
	When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,	999
	Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think	999
	Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,	999
	Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me	999
	I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,	999
	That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis	999
	A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,	999
	When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness	999
	Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood	999
	Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!	999
	Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,	999
	My hunger's gone; but even before, I was	999
	At point to sink for food. But what is this?	999
	Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:	999
	I were best not to call; I dare not call:	999
	yet famine,	999
	Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,	999
	Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever	999
	Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?	999
	If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,	999
	Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.	999
	Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy	999
	But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.	999
	Such a foe, good heavens!	999
	999
	[Exit, to the cave]	999
	999
	[Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS]	999
	999
BELARIUS	You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and	999
	Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I	999
	Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:	999
	The sweat of industry would dry and die,	999
	But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs	999
	Will make what's homely savoury: weariness	999
	Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth	999
	Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,	999
	Poor house, that keep'st thyself!	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	I am thoroughly weary.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that,	999
	Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.	999
	999
BELARIUS	[Looking into the cave]	999
	999
	Stay; come not in.	999
	But that it eats our victuals, I should think	999
	Here were a fairy.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	What's the matter, sir?	999
	999
BELARIUS	By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,	999
	An earthly paragon! Behold divineness	999
	No elder than a boy!	999
	999
	[Re-enter IMOGEN]	999
	999
IMOGEN	Good masters, harm me not:	999
	Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought	999
	To have begg'd or bought what I have took:	999
	good troth,	999
	I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found	999
	Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:	999
	I would have left it on the board so soon	999
	As I had made my meal, and parted	999
	With prayers for the provider.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Money, youth?	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!	999
	As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those	999
	Who worship dirty gods.	999
	999
IMOGEN	I see you're angry:	999
	Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should	999
	Have died had I not made it.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Whither bound?	999
	999
IMOGEN	To Milford-Haven.	999
	999
BELARIUS	What's your name?	999
	999
IMOGEN	Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who	999
	Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;	999
	To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,	999
	I am fall'n in this offence.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Prithee, fair youth,	999
	Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds	999
	By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!	999
	'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer	999
	Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.	999
	Boys, bid him welcome.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Were you a woman, youth,	999
	I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,	999
	I bid for you as I'd buy.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	I'll make't my comfort	999
	He is a man; I'll love him as my brother:	999
	And such a welcome as I'd give to him	999
	After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!	999
	Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.	999
	999
IMOGEN	'Mongst friends,	999
	If brothers.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	Would it had been so, that they	999
	Had been my father's sons! then had my prize	999
	Been less, and so more equal ballasting	999
	To thee, Posthumus.	999
	999
BELARIUS	He wrings at some distress.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Would I could free't!	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Or I, whate'er it be,	999
	What pain it cost, what danger. God's!	999
	999
BELARIUS	Hark, boys.	999
	999
	[Whispering]	999
	999
IMOGEN	Great men,	999
	That had a court no bigger than this cave,	999
	That did attend themselves and had the virtue	999
	Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by	999
	That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--	999
	Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!	999
	I'd change my sex to be companion with them,	999
	Since Leonatus's false.	999
	999
BELARIUS	It shall be so.	999
	Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:	999
	Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,	999
	We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,	999
	So far as thou wilt speak it.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Pray, draw near.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	The night to the owl and morn to the lark	999
	less welcome.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter two Senators and Tribunes]	999
	999
First Senator	This is the tenor of the emperor's writ:	999
	That since the common men are now in action	999
	'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,	999
	And that the legions now in Gallia are	999
	Full weak to undertake our wars against	999
	The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite	999
	The gentry to this business. He creates	999
	Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,	999
	For this immediate levy, he commends	999
	His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!	999
	999
First Tribune	Is Lucius general of the forces?	999
	999
Second Senator	Ay.	999
	999
First Tribune	Remaining now in Gallia?	999
	999
First Senator	With those legions	999
	Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy	999

SCENE I	Wales: near the cave of Belarius.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CLOTEN]	999
	999
CLOTEN	I am near to the place where they should meet, if	999
	Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments	999
	serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by	999
	him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the	999
	rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said	999
	a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must	999
	play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it	999
	is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer	999
	in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are	999
	as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,	999
	not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the	999
	advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike	999
	conversant in general services, and more remarkable	999
	in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant	999
	thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!	999
	Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy	999
	shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy	999
	mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before	999
	thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her	999
	father; who may haply be a little angry for my so	999
	rough usage; but my mother, having power of his	999
	testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My	999
	horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore	999
	purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is	999
	the very description of their meeting-place; and	999
	the fellow dares not deceive me.	999

SCENE II	Before the cave of Belarius.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS,	999
	ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN]	999
	999
BELARIUS	[To IMOGEN]  You are not well: remain here in the cave;	999
	We'll come to you after hunting.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	[To IMOGEN]	Brother, stay here	999
	Are we not brothers?	999
	999
IMOGEN	So man and man should be;	999
	But clay and clay differs in dignity,	999
	Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.	999
	999
IMOGEN	So sick I am not, yet I am not well;	999
	But not so citizen a wanton as	999
	To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;	999
	Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom	999
	Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me	999
	Cannot amend me; society is no comfort	999
	To one not sociable: I am not very sick,	999
	Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:	999
	I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,	999
	Stealing so poorly.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	I love thee; I have spoke it	999
	How much the quantity, the weight as much,	999
	As I do love my father.	999
	999
BELARIUS	What! how! how!	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	If it be sin to say so, I yoke me	999
	In my good brother's fault: I know not why	999
	I love this youth; and I have heard you say,	999
	Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,	999
	And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say	999
	'My father, not this youth.'	999
	999
BELARIUS	[Aside]	O noble strain!	999
	O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!	999
	Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:	999
	Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.	999
	I'm not their father; yet who this should be,	999
	Doth miracle itself, loved before me.	999
	'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Brother, farewell.	999
	999
IMOGEN	I wish ye sport.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	                  You health. So please you, sir.	999
	999
IMOGEN	[Aside]  These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies	999
	I have heard!	999
	Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:	999
	Experience, O, thou disprovest report!	999
	The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish	999
	Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.	999
	I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,	999
	I'll now taste of thy drug.	999
	999
	[Swallows some]	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	I could not stir him:	999
	He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;	999
	Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafter	999
	I might know more.	999
	999
BELARIUS	To the field, to the field!	999
	We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	We'll not be long away.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Pray, be not sick,	999
	For you must be our housewife.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Well or ill,	999
	I am bound to you.	999
	999
BELARIUS	And shalt be ever.	999
	999
	[Exit IMOGEN, to the cave]	999
	999
	This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath had	999
	Good ancestors.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	                  How angel-like he sings!	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	But his neat cookery! he cut our roots	999
	In characters,	999
	And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick	999
	And he her dieter.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Nobly he yokes	999
	A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh	999
	Was that it was, for not being such a smile;	999
	The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly	999
	From so divine a temple, to commix	999
	With winds that sailors rail at.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	I do note	999
	That grief and patience, rooted in him both,	999
	Mingle their spurs together.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Grow, patience!	999
	And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine	999
	His perishing root with the increasing vine!	999
	999
BELARIUS	It is great morning. Come, away!--	999
	Who's there?	999
	999
	[Enter CLOTEN]	999
	999
CLOTEN	I cannot find those runagates; that villain	999
	Hath mock'd me. I am faint.	999
	999
BELARIUS	'Those runagates!'	999
	Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis	999
	Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.	999
	I saw him not these many years, and yet	999
	I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	He is but one: you and my brother search	999
	What companies are near: pray you, away;	999
	Let me alone with him.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS]	999
	999
CLOTEN	                  Soft! What are you	999
	That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?	999
	I have heard of such. What slave art thou?	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	A thing	999
	More slavish did I ne'er than answering	999
	A slave without a knock.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Thou art a robber,	999
	A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I	999
	An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?	999
	Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not	999
	My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,	999
	Why I should yield to thee?	999
	999
CLOTEN	Thou villain base,	999
	Know'st me not by my clothes?	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	No, nor thy tailor, rascal,	999
	Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,	999
	Which, as it seems, make thee.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Thou precious varlet,	999
	My tailor made them not.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Hence, then, and thank	999
	The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;	999
	I am loath to beat thee.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Thou injurious thief,	999
	Hear but my name, and tremble.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	What's thy name?	999
	999
CLOTEN	Cloten, thou villain.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,	999
	I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or	999
	Adder, Spider,	999
	'Twould move me sooner.	999
	999
CLOTEN	To thy further fear,	999
	Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know	999
	I am son to the queen.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	I am sorry for 't; not seeming	999
	So worthy as thy birth.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Art not afeard?	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:	999
	At fools I laugh, not fear them.	999
	999
CLOTEN	Die the death:	999
	When I have slain thee with my proper hand,	999
	I'll follow those that even now fled hence,	999
	And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:	999
	Yield, rustic mountaineer.	999
	999
	[Exeunt, fighting]	999
	999
	[Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS]	999
	999
BELARIUS	No companies abroad?	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.	999
	999
BELARIUS	I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,	999
	But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour	999
	Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,	999
	And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute	999
	'Twas very Cloten.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	                  In this place we left them:	999
	I wish my brother make good time with him,	999
	You say he is so fell.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Being scarce made up,	999
	I mean, to man, he had not apprehension	999
	Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgment	999
	Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.	999
	999
	[Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head]	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;	999
	There was no money in't: not Hercules	999
	Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:	999
	Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne	999
	My head as I do his.	999
	999
BELARIUS	What hast thou done?	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,	999
	Son to the queen, after his own report;	999
	Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore	999
	With his own single hand he'ld take us in	999
	Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,	999
	And set them on Lud's-town.	999
	999
BELARIUS	We are all undone.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,	999
	But that he swore to take, our lives? The law	999
	Protects not us: then why should we be tender	999
	To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,	999
	Play judge and executioner all himself,	999
	For we do fear the law? What company	999
	Discover you abroad?	999
	999
BELARIUS	No single soul	999
	Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason	999
	He must have some attendants. Though his humour	999
	Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that	999
	From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not	999
	Absolute madness could so far have raved	999
	To bring him here alone; although perhaps	999
	It may be heard at court that such as we	999
	Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time	999
	May make some stronger head; the which he hearing--	999
	As it is like him--might break out, and swear	999
	He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable	999
	To come alone, either he so undertaking,	999
	Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,	999
	If we do fear this body hath a tail	999
	More perilous than the head.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Let ordinance	999
	Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,	999
	My brother hath done well.	999
	999
BELARIUS	I had no mind	999
	To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness	999
	Did make my way long forth.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	With his own sword,	999
	Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en	999
	His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek	999
	Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,	999
	And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:	999
	That's all I reck.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BELARIUS	I fear 'twill be revenged:	999
	Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valour	999
	Becomes thee well enough.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Would I had done't	999
	So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,	999
	I love thee brotherly, but envy much	999
	Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,	999
	That possible strength might meet, would seek us through	999
	And put us to our answer.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Well, 'tis done:	999
	We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger	999
	Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;	999
	You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay	999
	Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him	999
	To dinner presently.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Poor sick Fidele!	999
	I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour	999
	I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,	999
	And praise myself for charity.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BELARIUS	O thou goddess,	999
	Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st	999
	In these two princely boys! They are as gentle	999
	As zephyrs blowing below the violet,	999
	Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,	999
	Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,	999
	That by the top doth take the mountain pine,	999
	And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder	999
	That an invisible instinct should frame them	999
	To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,	999
	Civility not seen from other, valour	999
	That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop	999
	As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange	999
	What Cloten's being here to us portends,	999
	Or what his death will bring us.	999
	999
	[Re-enter GUIDERIUS]	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Where's my brother?	999
	I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,	999
	In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage	999
	For his return.	999
	999
	[Solemn music]	999
	999
BELARIUS	                  My ingenious instrument!	999
	Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion	999
	Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Is he at home?	999
	999
BELARIUS	                  He went hence even now.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother	999
	it did not speak before. All solemn things	999
	Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?	999
	Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys	999
	Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.	999
	Is Cadwal mad?	999
	999
BELARIUS	                  Look, here he comes,	999
	And brings the dire occasion in his arms	999
	Of what we blame him for.	999
	999
	[Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead,	999
	bearing her in his arms]	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	The bird is dead	999
	That we have made so much on. I had rather	999
	Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,	999
	To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,	999
	Than have seen this.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	O sweetest, fairest lily!	999
	My brother wears thee not the one half so well	999
	As when thou grew'st thyself.	999
	999
BELARIUS	O melancholy!	999
	Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find	999
	The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare	999
	Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!	999
	Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,	999
	Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.	999
	How found you him?	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Stark, as you see:	999
	Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,	999
	Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his	999
	right cheek	999
	Reposing on a cushion.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Where?	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	O' the floor;	999
	His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put	999
	My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness	999
	Answer'd my steps too loud.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Why, he but sleeps:	999
	If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;	999
	With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,	999
	And worms will not come to thee.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	With fairest flowers	999
	Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,	999
	I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack	999
	The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor	999
	The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor	999
	The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,	999
	Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,	999
	With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming	999
	Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie	999
	Without a monument!--bring thee all this;	999
	Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,	999
	To winter-ground thy corse.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Prithee, have done;	999
	And do not play in wench-like words with that	999
	Which is so serious. Let us bury him,	999
	And not protract with admiration what	999
	Is now due debt. To the grave!	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Say, where shall's lay him?	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	By good Euriphile, our mother.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Be't so:	999
	And let us, Polydore, though now our voices	999
	Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,	999
	As once our mother; use like note and words,	999
	Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Cadwal,	999
	I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;	999
	For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse	999
	Than priests and fanes that lie.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	We'll speak it, then.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten	999
	Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;	999
	And though he came our enemy, remember	999
	He was paid for that: though mean and	999
	mighty, rotting	999
	Together, have one dust, yet reverence,	999
	That angel of the world, doth make distinction	999
	Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely	999
	And though you took his life, as being our foe,	999
	Yet bury him as a prince.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Pray You, fetch him hither.	999
	Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',	999
	When neither are alive.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	If you'll go fetch him,	999
	We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.	999
	999
	[Exit BELARIUS]	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;	999
	My father hath a reason for't.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	'Tis true.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Come on then, and remove him.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	So. Begin.	999
	[SONG]	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	     Fear no more the heat o' the sun,	999
	Nor the furious winter's rages;	999
	Thou thy worldly task hast done,	999
	Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:	999
	Golden lads and girls all must,	999
	As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	     Fear no more the frown o' the great;	999
	Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;	999
	Care no more to clothe and eat;	999
	To thee the reed is as the oak:	999
	The sceptre, learning, physic, must	999
	All follow this, and come to dust.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	     Fear no more the lightning flash,	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	        Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	     Fear not slander, censure rash;	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	        Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:	999
	999
	999

	999
GUIDERIUS	We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more:	999
	The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night	999
	Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.	999
	You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so	999
	These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.	999
	Come on, away: apart upon our knees.	999
	The ground that gave them first has them again:	999
	Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.	999

IMOGEN	[Awaking]  Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is	999
	the way?--	999
	I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither?	999
	'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--	999
	I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.	999
	But, soft! no bedfellow!--O gods and goddesses!	999
	999
	[Seeing the body of CLOTEN]	999
	999
	These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;	999
	This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;	999
	For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,	999
	And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;	999
	'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,	999
	Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes	999
	Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,	999
	I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be	999
	Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity	999
	As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!	999
	The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is	999
	Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt.	999
	A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!	999
	I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;	999
	His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;	999
	The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face	999
	Murder in heaven?--How!--'Tis gone. Pisanio,	999
	All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,	999
	And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,	999
	Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,	999
	Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read	999
	Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio	999
	Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--	999
	From this most bravest vessel of the world	999
	Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,	999
	Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!	999
	where's that?	999
	Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,	999
	And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?	999
	'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them	999
	Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!	999
	The drug he gave me, which he said was precious	999
	And cordial to me, have I not found it	999
	Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home:	999
	This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!	999
	Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,	999
	That we the horrider may seem to those	999
	Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!	999

Captain	To them the legions garrison'd in Gailia,	999
	After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending	999
	You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:	999
	They are in readiness.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	But what from Rome?	999
	999
Captain	The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners	999
	And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,	999
	That promise noble service: and they come	999
	Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,	999
	Syenna's brother.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	                  When expect you them?	999
	999
Captain	With the next benefit o' the wind.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	This forwardness	999
	Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers	999
	Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir,	999
	What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?	999
	999
Soothsayer	Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--	999
	I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:	999
	I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd	999
	From the spongy south to this part of the west,	999
	There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--	999
	Unless my sins abuse my divination--	999
	Success to the Roman host.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	Dream often so,	999
	And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here	999
	Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime	999
	It was a worthy building. How! a page!	999
	Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;	999
	For nature doth abhor to make his bed	999
	With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.	999
	Let's see the boy's face.	999
	999
Captain	He's alive, my lord.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,	999
	Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems	999
	They crave to be demanded. Who is this	999
	Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he	999
	That, otherwise than noble nature did,	999
	Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest	999
	In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?	999
	What art thou?	999
	999
IMOGEN	                  I am nothing: or if not,	999
	Nothing to be were better. This was my master,	999
	A very valiant Briton and a good,	999
	That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!	999
	There is no more such masters: I may wander	999
	From east to occident, cry out for service,	999
	Try many, all good, serve truly, never	999
	Find such another master.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	'Lack, good youth!	999
	Thou movest no less with thy complaining than	999
	Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Richard du Champ.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	If I do lie and do	999
	No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope	999
	They'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	Thy name?	999
	999
IMOGEN	Fidele, sir.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	Thou dost approve thyself the very same:	999
	Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.	999
	Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say	999
	Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,	999
	No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,	999
	Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner	999
	Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.	999
	999
IMOGEN	I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,	999
	I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep	999
	As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when	999
	With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,	999
	And on it said a century of prayers,	999
	Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;	999
	And leaving so his service, follow you,	999
	So please you entertain me.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	Ay, good youth!	999
	And rather father thee than master thee.	999
	My friends,	999
	The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us	999
	Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,	999
	And make him with our pikes and partisans	999
	A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd	999
	By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd	999
	As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes	999
	Some falls are means the happier to arise.	999

	999
CYMBELINE	Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.	999
	999
	[Exit an Attendant]	999
	999
	A fever with the absence of her son,	999
	A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,	999
	How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,	999
	The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen	999
	Upon a desperate bed, and in a time	999
	When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,	999
	So needful for this present: it strikes me, past	999
	The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,	999
	Who needs must know of her departure and	999
	Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee	999
	By a sharp torture.	999
	999
PISANIO	Sir, my life is yours;	999
	I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,	999
	I nothing know where she remains, why gone,	999
	Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,	999
	Hold me your loyal servant.	999
	999
First Lord	Good my liege,	999
	The day that she was missing he was here:	999
	I dare be bound he's true and shall perform	999
	All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,	999
	There wants no diligence in seeking him,	999
	And will, no doubt, be found.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	The time is troublesome.	999
	999
	[To PISANIO]	999

	We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy	999

	999
First Lord	                  So please your majesty,	999
	The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,	999
	Are landed on your coast, with a supply	999
	Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Now for the counsel of my son and queen!	999
	I am amazed with matter.	999
	999
First Lord	Good my liege,	999
	Your preparation can affront no less	999
	Than what you hear of: come more, for more	999
	you're ready:	999
	The want is but to put those powers in motion	999
	That long to move.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	                  I thank you. Let's withdraw;	999
	And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not	999
	What can from Italy annoy us; but	999
	We grieve at chances here. Away!	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but PISANIO]	999
	999
PISANIO	I heard no letter from my master since	999
	I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:	999
	Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise	999
	To yield me often tidings: neither know I	999
	What is betid to Cloten; but remain	999
	Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.	999
	Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.	999
	These present wars shall find I love my country,	999
	Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.	999
	All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:	999
	Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.	999

	999
GUIDERIUS	The noise is round about us.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Let us from it.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it	999
	From action and adventure?	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Nay, what hope	999
	Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans	999
	Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us	999
	For barbarous and unnatural revolts	999
	During their use, and slay us after.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Sons,	999
	We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.	999
	To the king's party there's no going: newness	999
	Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd	999
	Among the bands--may drive us to a render	999
	Where we have lived, and so extort from's that	999
	Which we have done, whose answer would be death	999
	Drawn on with torture.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	This is, sir, a doubt	999
	In such a time nothing becoming you,	999
	Nor satisfying us.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	                  It is not likely	999
	That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,	999
	Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes	999
	And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,	999
	That they will waste their time upon our note,	999
	To know from whence we are.	999
	999
BELARIUS	O, I am known	999
	Of many in the army: many years,	999
	Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him	999
	From my remembrance. And, besides, the king	999
	Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;	999
	Who find in my exile the want of breeding,	999
	The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless	999
	To have the courtesy your cradle promised,	999
	But to be still hot summer's tamings and	999
	The shrinking slaves of winter.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Than be so	999
	Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:	999
	I and my brother are not known; yourself	999
	So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,	999
	Cannot be question'd.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	By this sun that shines,	999
	I'll thither: what thing is it that I never	999
	Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,	999
	But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!	999
	Never bestrid a horse, save one that had	999
	A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel	999
	Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed	999
	To look upon the holy sun, to have	999
	The benefit of his blest beams, remaining	999
	So long a poor unknown.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	By heavens, I'll go:	999
	If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,	999
	I'll take the better care, but if you will not,	999
	The hazard therefore due fall on me by	999
	The hands of Romans!	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	So say I	amen.	999
	999
BELARIUS	No reason I, since of your lives you set	999
	So slight a valuation, should reserve	999
	My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!	999
	If in your country wars you chance to die,	999

POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd	999
	Thou shouldst be colour'd thus. You married ones,	999
	If each of you should take this course, how many	999
	Must murder wives much better than themselves	999
	For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!	999
	Every good servant does not all commands:	999
	No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you	999
	Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never	999
	Had lived to put on this: so had you saved	999
	The noble Imogen to repent, and struck	999
	Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,	999
	You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,	999
	To have them fall no more: you some permit	999
	To second ills with ills, each elder worse,	999
	And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.	999
	But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,	999
	And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither	999
	Among the Italian gentry, and to fight	999
	Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough	999
	That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!	999
	I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,	999
	Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me	999
	Of these Italian weeds and suit myself	999
	As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight	999
	Against the part I come with; so I'll die	999
	For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life	999
	Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,	999
	Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril	999
	Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know	999

	999
IACHIMO	The heaviness and guilt within my bosom	999
	Takes off my manhood: I have belied a lady,	999
	The princess of this country, and the air on't	999
	Revengingly enfeebles me; or could this carl,	999
	A very drudge of nature's, have subdued me	999
	In my profession? Knighthoods and honours, borne	999
	As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.	999

	999
Lord	I did.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,	999
	But that the heavens fought: the king himself	999
	Of his wings destitute, the army broken,	999
	And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying	999
	Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,	999
	Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work	999
	More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down	999
	Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling	999
	Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd	999
	With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living	999
	To die with lengthen'd shame.	999
	999
Lord	Where was this lane?	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;	999
	Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,	999
	An honest one, I warrant; who deserved	999
	So long a breeding as his white beard came to,	999
	In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,	999
	He, with two striplings-lads more like to run	999
	The country base than to commit such slaughter	999
	With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer	999
	Than those for preservation cased, or shame--	999
	Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,	999
	'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:	999
	To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;	999
	Or we are Romans and will give you that	999
	Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,	999
	But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'	999
	These three,	999
	Three thousand confident, in act as many--	999
	For three performers are the file when all	999
	The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'	999
	Accommodated by the place, more charming	999
	With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd	999
	A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,	999
	Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,	999
	turn'd coward	999
	But by example--O, a sin in war,	999
	Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look	999
	The way that they did, and to grin like lions	999
	Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began	999
	A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon	999
	A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly	999
	Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,	999
	The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,	999
	Like fragments in hard voyages, became	999
	The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open	999
	Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!	999
	Some slain before; some dying; some their friends	999
	O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,	999
	Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:	999
	Those that would die or ere resist are grown	999
	The mortal bugs o' the field.	999
	999
Lord	This was strange chance	999
	A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made	999
	Rather to wonder at the things you hear	999
	Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,	999
	And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:	999
	'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,	999
	Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'	999
	999
Lord	Nay, be not angry, sir.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	'Lack, to what end?	999
	Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;	999
	For if he'll do as he is made to do,	999
	I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.	999
	You have put me into rhyme.	999
	999
Lord	Farewell; you're angry.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Still going?	999
	999
	[Exit Lord]	999
	999
	This is a lord! O noble misery,	999
	To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!	999
	To-day how many would have given their honours	999
	To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,	999
	And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,	999
	Could not find death where I did hear him groan,	999
	Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,	999
	'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,	999
	Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we	999
	That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him	999
	For being now a favourer to the Briton,	999
	No more a Briton, I have resumed again	999
	The part I came in: fight I will no more,	999
	But yield me to the veriest hind that shall	999
	Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is	999
	Here made by the Roman; great the answer be	999
	Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;	999
	On either side I come to spend my breath;	999
	Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,	999
	But end it by some means for Imogen.	999
	999
	[Enter two British Captains and Soldiers]	999
	999
First Captain	Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.	999
	'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.	999
	999
Second Captain	There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,	999
	That gave the affront with them.	999
	999
First Captain	So 'tis reported:	999
	But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	A Roman,	999
	Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds	999
	Had answer'd him.	999
	999
Second Captain	                  Lay hands on him; a dog!	999
	A leg of Rome shall not return to tell	999
	What crows have peck'd them here. He brags	999
	his service	999
	As if he were of note: bring him to the king.	999
	999
	[Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS,	999
	PISANIO, Soldiers, Attendants, and Roman Captives.	999

	[Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and two Gaolers]	999
	999
First Gaoler	You shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you;	999
	So graze as you find pasture.	999
	999
Second Gaoler	Ay, or a stomach.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Gaolers]	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,	999
	think, to liberty: yet am I better	999
	Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather	999
	Groan so in perpetuity than be cured	999
	By the sure physician, death, who is the key	999
	To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd	999
	More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me	999
	The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,	999
	Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?	999
	So children temporal fathers do appease;	999
	Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?	999
	I cannot do it better than in gyves,	999
	Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,	999
	If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take	999
	No stricter render of me than my all.	999
	I know you are more clement than vile men,	999
	Who of their broken debtors take a third,	999
	A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again	999
	On their abatement: that's not my desire:	999
	For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though	999
	'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:	999
	'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;	999
	Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:	999
	You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,	999
	If you will take this audit, take this life,	999
	And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!	999
	I'll speak to thee in silence.	999
	999
	[Sleeps]	999
	999
	[Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition,	999
	SICILIUS LEONATUS, father to Posthumus Leonatus,	999
	an old man, attired like a warrior; leading in	999
	his hand an ancient matron, his wife, and mother	999
	to Posthumus Leonatus, with music before them:	999
	then, after other music, follow the two young	999
	Leonati, brothers to Posthumus Leonatus, with	999
	wounds as they died in the wars. They circle	999
	Posthumus Leonatus round, as he lies sleeping]	999
	999
Sicilius Leonatus	No more, thou thunder-master, show	999
	Thy spite on mortal flies:	999
	With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,	999
	That thy adulteries	999
	Rates and revenges.	999
	Hath my poor boy done aught but well,	999
	Whose face I never saw?	999
	I died whilst in the womb he stay'd	999
	Attending nature's law:	999
	Whose father then, as men report	999
	Thou orphans' father art,	999
	Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him	999
	From this earth-vexing smart.	999
	999
Mother	Lucina lent not me her aid,	999
	But took me in my throes;	999
	That from me was Posthumus ript,	999
	Came crying 'mongst his foes,	999
	A thing of pity!	999
	999
Sicilius Leonatus	Great nature, like his ancestry,	999
	Moulded the stuff so fair,	999
	That he deserved the praise o' the world,	999
	As great Sicilius' heir.	999
	999
First Brother	When once he was mature for man,	999
	In Britain where was he	999
	That could stand up his parallel;	999
	Or fruitful object be	999
	In eye of Imogen, that best	999
	Could deem his dignity?	999
	999
Mother	With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,	999
	To be exiled, and thrown	999
	From Leonati seat, and cast	999
	From her his dearest one,	999
	Sweet Imogen?	999
	999
Sicilius Leonatus	Why did you suffer Iachimo,	999
	Slight thing of Italy,	999
	To taint his nobler heart and brain	999
	With needless jealosy;	999
	And to become the geck and scorn	999
	O' th' other's villany?	999
	999
Second Brother	For this from stiller seats we came,	999
	Our parents and us twain,	999
	That striking in our country's cause	999
	Fell bravely and were slain,	999
	Our fealty and Tenantius' right	999
	With honour to maintain.	999
	999
First Brother	Like hardiment Posthumus hath	999
	To Cymbeline perform'd:	999
	Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,	999
	Why hast thou thus adjourn'd	999
	The graces for his merits due,	999
	Being all to dolours turn'd?	999
	999
Sicilius Leonatus	Thy crystal window ope; look out;	999
	No longer exercise	999
	Upon a valiant race thy harsh	999
	And potent injuries.	999
	999
Mother	Since, Jupiter, our son is good,	999
	Take off his miseries.	999
	999
Sicilius Leonatus	Peep through thy marble mansion; help;	999
	Or we poor ghosts will cry	999
	To the shining synod of the rest	999
	Against thy deity.	999
	999
	999
First Brother	|   Help, Jupiter; or we appeal,	999
	|   And from thy justice fly.	999
Second Brother	|	999
	999
	999
	[Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting	999
	upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The	999
	Apparitions fall on their knees]	999
	999
Jupiter	No more, you petty spirits of region low,	999
	Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts	999
	Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,	999
	Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?	999
	Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest	999
	Upon your never-withering banks of flowers:	999
	Be not with mortal accidents opprest;	999
	No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.	999
	Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,	999
	The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;	999
	Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:	999
	His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.	999
	Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in	999
	Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.	999
	He shall be lord of lady Imogen,	999
	And happier much by his affliction made.	999
	This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein	999
	Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine:	999
	and so, away: no further with your din	999
	Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.	999
	Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.	999
	999
	[Ascends]	999
	999
Sicilius Leonatus	He came in thunder; his celestial breath	999
	Was sulphurous to smell: the holy eagle	999
	Stoop'd as to foot us: his ascension is	999
	More sweet than our blest fields: his royal bird	999
	Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,	999
	As when his god is pleased.	999
	999
All	Thanks, Jupiter!	999
	999
Sicilius Leonatus	The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd	999
	His radiant root. Away! and, to be blest,	999
	Let us with care perform his great behest.	999
	999
	[The Apparitions vanish]	999
	999
Posthumus Leonatus	[Waking]  Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot	999
	A father to me; and thou hast created	999
	A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!	999
	Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:	999
	And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend	999
	On greatness' favour dream as I have done,	999
	Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:	999
	Many dream not to find, neither deserve,	999
	And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,	999
	That have this golden chance and know not why.	999
	What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!	999
	Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment	999
	Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects	999
	So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,	999
	As good as promise.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,	999
	without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of	999
	tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be	999
	lopped branches, which, being dead many years,	999
	shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock and	999
	freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,	999
	Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'	999
	'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen	999
	Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing;	999
	Or senseless speaking or a speaking such	999
	As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,	999
	The action of my life is like it, which	999
	I'll keep, if but for sympathy.	999
	999
	[Re-enter First Gaoler]	999
	999
First Gaoler	Come, sir, are you ready for death?	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.	999
	999
First Gaoler	Hanging is the word, sir: if	999
	you be ready for that, you are well cooked.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	So, if I prove a good repast to the	999
	spectators, the dish pays the shot.	999
	999
First Gaoler	A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,	999
	you shall be called to no more payments, fear no	999
	more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of	999
	parting, as the procuring of mirth: you come in	999
	flint for want of meat, depart reeling with too	999
	much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and	999
	sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain	999
	both empty; the brain the heavier for being too	999
	light, the purse too light, being drawn of	999
	heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be	999
	quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up	999
	thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and	999
	creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,	999
	the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book and	999
	counters; so the acquittance follows.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I am merrier to die than thou art to live.	999
	999
First Gaoler	Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the	999
	tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your	999
	sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he	999
	would change places with his officer; for, look you,	999
	sir, you know not which way you shall go.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Yes, indeed do I, fellow.	999
	999
First Gaoler	Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seen	999
	him so pictured: you must either be directed by	999
	some that take upon them to know, or do take upon	999
	yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or	999
	jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how	999
	you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll	999
	never return to tell one.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to	999
	direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and	999
	will not use them.	999
	999
First Gaoler	What an infinite mock is this, that a man should	999
	have the best use of eyes to see the way of	999
	blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999

Messenger	Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.	999
	999
First Gaoler	I'll be hang'd then.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.	999
	999
	[Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and Messenger]	999
	999
First Gaoler	Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young	999
	gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my	999
	conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,	999
	for all he be a Roman: and there be some of them	999
	too that die against their wills; so should I, if I	999
	were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one	999
	mind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers and	999
	gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but	999

	PISANIO, Lords, Officers, and Attendants]	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made	999
	Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart	999
	That the poor soldier that so richly fought,	999
	Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast	999
	Stepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:	999
	He shall be happy that can find him, if	999
	Our grace can make him so.	999
	999
BELARIUS	I never saw	999
	Such noble fury in so poor a thing;	999
	Such precious deeds in one that promises nought	999
	But beggary and poor looks.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	No tidings of him?	999
	999
PISANIO	He hath been search'd among the dead and living,	999
	But no trace of him.	999

	999
	[To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS]	999
	999
		    which I will add	999
	To you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,	999
	By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time	999
	To ask of whence you are. Report it.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Sir,	999
	In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:	999
	Further to boast were neither true nor modest,	999
	Unless I add, we are honest.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Bow your knees.	999

	With dignities becoming your estates.	999
	999
	[Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies]	999

	And not o' the court of Britain.	999
	999
CORNELIUS	Hail, great king!	999
	To sour your happiness, I must report	999
	The queen is dead.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Who worse than a physician	999
	Would this report become? But I consider,	999
	By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death	999
	Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?	999
	999
CORNELIUS	With horror, madly dying, like her life,	999
	Which, being cruel to the world, concluded	999
	Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd	999
	I will report, so please you: these her women	999
	Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks	999
	Were present when she finish'd.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Prithee, say.	999
	999
CORNELIUS	First, she confess'd she never loved you, only	999
	Affected greatness got by you, not you:	999
	Married your royalty, was wife to your place;	999
	Abhorr'd your person.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	She alone knew this;	999
	And, but she spoke it dying, I would not	999
	Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.	999
	999
CORNELIUS	Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love	999
	With such integrity, she did confess	999
	Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,	999
	But that her flight prevented it, she had	999
	Ta'en off by poison.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	O most delicate fiend!	999
	Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?	999
	999
CORNELIUS	More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had	999
	For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,	999
	Should by the minute feed on life and lingering	999
	By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,	999
	By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to	999
	O'ercome you with her show, and in time,	999
	When she had fitted you with her craft, to work	999
	Her son into the adoption of the crown:	999
	But, failing of her end by his strange absence,	999
	Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite	999
	Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented	999
	The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so	999
	Despairing died.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	                  Heard you all this, her women?	999
	999
First Lady	We did, so please your highness.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Mine eyes	999
	Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;	999
	Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,	999
	That thought her like her seeming; it had	999
	been vicious	999
	To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!	999
	That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,	999
	And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!	999
	999
	[Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other	999
	Roman Prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	999
	behind, and IMOGEN]	999
	999
	Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that	999
	The Britons have razed out, though with the loss	999
	Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit	999
	That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter	999
	Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:	999
	So think of your estate.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day	999
	Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,	999
	We should not, when the blood was cool,	999
	have threaten'd	999
	Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods	999
	Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives	999
	May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth	999
	A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:	999
	Augustus lives to think on't: and so much	999
	For my peculiar care. This one thing only	999
	I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,	999
	Let him be ransom'd: never master had	999
	A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,	999
	So tender over his occasions, true,	999
	So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join	999
	With my request, which I make bold your highness	999
	Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,	999
	Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,	999
	And spare no blood beside.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	I have surely seen him:	999
	His favour is familiar to me. Boy,	999
	Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,	999
	And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,	999
	To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:	999
	And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,	999
	Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;	999
	Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,	999
	The noblest ta'en.	999
	999
IMOGEN	                  I humbly thank your highness.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;	999
	And yet I know thou wilt.	999
	999
IMOGEN	No, no: alack,	999
	There's other work in hand: I see a thing	999
	Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,	999
	Must shuffle for itself.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	The boy disdains me,	999
	He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys	999
	That place them on the truth of girls and boys.	999
	Why stands he so perplex'd?	999
	999
CYMBELINE	What wouldst thou, boy?	999
	I love thee more and more: think more and more	999
	What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,	999
	Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?	999
	999
IMOGEN	He is a Roman; no more kin to me	999
	Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,	999
	Am something nearer.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Wherefore eyest him so?	999
	999
IMOGEN	I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please	999
	To give me hearing.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Ay, with all my heart,	999
	And lend my best attention. What's thy name?	999
	999
IMOGEN	Fidele, sir.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	                  Thou'rt my good youth, my page;	999
	I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.	999
	999
	[CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart]	999
	999
BELARIUS	Is not this boy revived from death?	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	One sand another	999
	Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad	999
	Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	The same dead thing alive.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Peace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;	999
	Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sure	999
	He would have spoke to us.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	But we saw him dead.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Be silent; let's see further.	999
	999
PISANIO	[Aside]	It is my mistress:	999
	Since she is living, let the time run on	999
	To good or bad.	999
	999
	[CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward]	999
	999
CYMBELINE	                  Come, stand thou by our side;	999
	Make thy demand aloud.	999
	999
	[To IACHIMO]	999
		  Sir, step you forth;	999
	Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;	999
	Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,	999
	Which is our honour, bitter torture shall	999
	Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.	999
	999
IMOGEN	My boon is, that this gentleman may render	999
	Of whom he had this ring.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	[Aside]                 What's that to him?	999
	999
CYMBELINE	That diamond upon your finger, say	999
	How came it yours?	999
	999
IACHIMO	Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that	999
	Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	How! me?	999
	999
IACHIMO	I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that	999
	Which torments me to conceal. By villany	999
	I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;	999
	Whom thou didst banish; and--which more may	999
	grieve thee,	999
	As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived	999
	'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?	999
	999
CYMBELINE	All that belongs to this.	999
	999
IACHIMO	That paragon, thy daughter,--	999
	For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits	999
	Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:	999
	I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will	999
	Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock	999
	That struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursed	999
	The mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, would	999
	Our viands had been poison'd, or at least	999
	Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--	999
	What should I say? he was too good to be	999
	Where ill men were; and was the best of all	999
	Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,	999
	Hearing us praise our loves of Italy	999
	For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast	999
	Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming	999
	The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.	999
	Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,	999
	A shop of all the qualities that man	999
	Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,	999
	Fairness which strikes the eye--	999
	999
CYMBELINE	I stand on fire:	999
	Come to the matter.	999
	999
IACHIMO	All too soon I shall,	999
	Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,	999
	Most like a noble lord in love and one	999
	That had a royal lover, took his hint;	999
	And, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein	999
	He was as calm as virtue--he began	999
	His mistress' picture; which by his tongue	999
	being made,	999
	And then a mind put in't, either our brags	999
	Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description	999
	Proved us unspeaking sots.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Nay, nay, to the purpose.	999
	999
IACHIMO	Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.	999
	He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,	999
	And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,	999
	Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him	999
	Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore	999
	Upon his honour'd finger, to attain	999
	In suit the place of's bed and win this ring	999
	By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,	999
	No lesser of her honour confident	999
	Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;	999
	And would so, had it been a carbuncle	999
	Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it	999
	Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain	999
	Post I in this design: well may you, sir,	999
	Remember me at court; where I was taught	999
	Of your chaste daughter the wide difference	999
	'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd	999
	Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain	999
	'Gan in your duller Britain operate	999
	Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:	999
	And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,	999
	That I return'd with simular proof enough	999
	To make the noble Leonatus mad,	999
	By wounding his belief in her renown	999
	With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes	999
	Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--	999
	O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks	999
	Of secret on her person, that he could not	999
	But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,	999
	I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--	999
	Methinks, I see him now--	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	[Advancing]             Ay, so thou dost,	999
	Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,	999
	Egregious murderer, thief, any thing	999
	That's due to all the villains past, in being,	999
	To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,	999
	Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out	999
	For torturers ingenious: it is I	999
	That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend	999
	By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,	999
	That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--	999
	That caused a lesser villain than myself,	999
	A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple	999
	Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.	999
	Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set	999
	The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain	999
	Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus; and	999
	Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!	999
	My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,	999
	Imogen, Imogen!	999
	999
IMOGEN	                  Peace, my lord; hear, hear--	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,	999
	There lie thy part.	999
	999
	[Striking her: she falls]	999
	999
PISANIO	O, gentlemen, help!	999
	Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!	999
	You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!	999
	Mine honour'd lady!	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Does the world go round?	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	How come these staggers on me?	999
	999
PISANIO	Wake, my mistress!	999
	999
CYMBELINE	If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me	999
	To death with mortal joy.	999
	999
PISANIO	How fares thy mistress?	999
	999
IMOGEN	O, get thee from my sight;	999
	Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!	999
	Breathe not where princes are.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	The tune of Imogen!	999
	999
PISANIO	Lady,	999
	The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if	999
	That box I gave you was not thought by me	999
	A precious thing: I had it from the queen.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	New matter still?	999
	999
IMOGEN	                  It poison'd me.	999
	999
CORNELIUS	O gods!	999
	I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.	999
	Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio	999
	Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection	999
	Which I gave him for cordial, she is served	999
	As I would serve a rat.'	999
	999
CYMBELINE	What's this, Comelius?	999
	999
CORNELIUS	The queen, sir, very oft importuned me	999
	To temper poisons for her, still pretending	999
	The satisfaction of her knowledge only	999
	In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,	999
	Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose	999
	Was of more danger, did compound for her	999
	A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease	999
	The present power of life, but in short time	999
	All offices of nature should again	999
	Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?	999
	999
IMOGEN	Most like I did, for I was dead.	999
	999
BELARIUS	My boys,	999
	There was our error.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	This is, sure, Fidele.	999
	999
IMOGEN	Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?	999
	Think that you are upon a rock; and now	999
	Throw me again.	999
	999
	[Embracing him]	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Hang there like a fruit, my soul,	999
	Till the tree die!	999
	999
CYMBELINE	                  How now, my flesh, my child!	999
	What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?	999
	Wilt thou not speak to me?	999
	999
IMOGEN	[Kneeling]               Your blessing, sir.	999
	999
BELARIUS	[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]  Though you did love	999
	this youth, I blame ye not:	999
	You had a motive for't.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	My tears that fall	999
	Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,	999
	Thy mother's dead.	999
	999
IMOGEN	I am sorry for't, my lord.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	O, she was nought; and long of her it was	999
	That we meet here so strangely: but her son	999
	Is gone, we know not how nor where.	999
	999
PISANIO	My lord,	999
	Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,	999
	Upon my lady's missing, came to me	999
	With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,	999
	If I discover'd not which way she was gone,	999
	It was my instant death. By accident,	999
	had a feigned letter of my master's	999
	Then in my pocket; which directed him	999
	To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;	999
	Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,	999
	Which he enforced from me, away he posts	999
	With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate	999
	My lady's honour: what became of him	999
	I further know not.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	Let me end the story:	999
	I slew him there.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Marry, the gods forfend!	999
	I would not thy good deeds should from my lips	999
	Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,	999
	Deny't again.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	                  I have spoke it, and I did it.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	He was a prince.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me	999
	Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me	999
	With language that would make me spurn the sea,	999
	If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;	999
	And am right glad he is not standing here	999
	To tell this tale of mine.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	I am sorry for thee:	999
	By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must	999
	Endure our law: thou'rt dead.	999
	999
IMOGEN	That headless man	999
	I thought had been my lord.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Bind the offender,	999
	And take him from our presence.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Stay, sir king:	999
	This man is better than the man he slew,	999
	As well descended as thyself; and hath	999
	More of thee merited than a band of Clotens	999
	Had ever scar for.	999
	999
	[To the Guard]	999
	999
	Let his arms alone;	999
	They were not born for bondage.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Why, old soldier,	999
	Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,	999
	By tasting of our wrath? How of descent	999
	As good as we?	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	                  In that he spake too far.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	And thou shalt die for't.	999
	999
BELARIUS	We will die all three:	999
	But I will prove that two on's are as good	999
	As I have given out him. My sons, I must,	999
	For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,	999
	Though, haply, well for you.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Your danger's ours.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	And our good his.	999
	999
BELARIUS	                  Have at it then, by leave.	999
	Thou hadst, great king, a subject who	999
	Was call'd Belarius.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	What of him? he is	999
	A banish'd traitor.	999
	999
BELARIUS	He it is that hath	999
	Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;	999
	I know not how a traitor.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Take him hence:	999
	The whole world shall not save him.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Not too hot:	999
	First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;	999
	And let it be confiscate all, so soon	999
	As I have received it.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Nursing of my sons!	999
	999
BELARIUS	I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:	999
	Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;	999
	Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,	999
	These two young gentlemen, that call me father	999
	And think they are my sons, are none of mine;	999
	They are the issue of your loins, my liege,	999
	And blood of your begetting.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	How! my issue!	999
	999
BELARIUS	So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,	999
	Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:	999
	Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment	999
	Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd	999
	Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--	999
	For such and so they are--these twenty years	999
	Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I	999
	Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as	999
	Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,	999
	Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children	999
	Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,	999
	Having received the punishment before,	999
	For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty	999
	Excited me to treason: their dear loss,	999
	The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped	999
	Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,	999
	Here are your sons again; and I must lose	999
	Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.	999
	The benediction of these covering heavens	999
	Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy	999
	To inlay heaven with stars.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Thou weep'st, and speak'st.	999
	The service that you three have done is more	999
	Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:	999
	If these be they, I know not how to wish	999
	A pair of worthier sons.	999
	999
BELARIUS	Be pleased awhile.	999
	This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,	999
	Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:	999
	This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,	999
	Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd	999
	In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand	999
	Of his queen mother, which for more probation	999
	I can with ease produce.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Guiderius had	999
	Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;	999
	It was a mark of wonder.	999
	999
BELARIUS	This is he;	999
	Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:	999
	It was wise nature's end in the donation,	999
	To be his evidence now.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	O, what, am I	999
	A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother	999
	Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,	999
	That, after this strange starting from your orbs,	999
	may reign in them now! O Imogen,	999
	Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.	999
	999
IMOGEN	No, my lord;	999
	I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,	999
	Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter	999
	But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,	999
	When I was but your sister; I you brothers,	999
	When ye were so indeed.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Did you e'er meet?	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	Ay, my good lord.	999
	999
GUIDERIUS	                  And at first meeting loved;	999
	Continued so, until we thought he died.	999
	999
CORNELIUS	By the queen's dram she swallow'd.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	O rare instinct!	999
	When shall I hear all through? This fierce	999
	abridgement	999
	Hath to it circumstantial branches, which	999
	Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?	999
	And when came you to serve our Roman captive?	999
	How parted with your brothers? how first met them?	999
	Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,	999
	And your three motives to the battle, with	999
	I know not how much more, should be demanded;	999
	And all the other by-dependencies,	999
	From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place	999
	Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,	999
	Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,	999
	And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye	999
	On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting	999
	Each object with a joy: the counterchange	999
	Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,	999
	And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.	999
	999
	[To BELARIUS]	999
	999
	Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.	999
	999
IMOGEN	You are my father too, and did relieve me,	999
	To see this gracious season.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	All o'erjoy'd,	999
	Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,	999
	For they shall taste our comfort.	999
	999
IMOGEN	My good master,	999
	I will yet do you service.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	Happy be you!	999
	999
CYMBELINE	The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,	999
	He would have well becomed this place, and graced	999
	The thankings of a king.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I am, sir,	999
	The soldier that did company these three	999
	In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for	999
	The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,	999
	Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might	999
	Have made you finish.	999
	999
IACHIMO	[Kneeling]          I am down again:	999
	But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,	999
	As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,	999
	Which I so often owe: but your ring first;	999
	And here the bracelet of the truest princess	999
	That ever swore her faith.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Kneel not to me:	999
	The power that I have on you is, to spare you;	999
	The malice towards you to forgive you: live,	999
	And deal with others better.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Nobly doom'd!	999
	We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;	999
	Pardon's the word to all.	999
	999
ARVIRAGUS	You holp us, sir,	999
	As you did mean indeed to be our brother;	999
	Joy'd are we that you are.	999
	999
POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,	999
	Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought	999
	Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,	999
	Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows	999
	Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found	999
	This label on my bosom; whose containing	999
	Is so from sense in hardness, that I can	999
	Make no collection of it: let him show	999
	His skill in the construction.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	Philarmonus!	999
	999
Soothsayer	Here, my good lord.	999
	999
CAIUS LUCIUS	Read, and declare the meaning.	999
	999
Soothsayer	[Reads]  'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself	999
	unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a	999
	piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar	999
	shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many	999
	years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old	999
	stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end	999
	his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in	999
	peace and plenty.'	999
	Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;	999
	The fit and apt construction of thy name,	999
	Being Leonatus, doth import so much.	999
	999
	[To CYMBELINE]	999
	999
	The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,	999
	Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'	999
	We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine	999
	Is this most constant wife; who, even now,	999
	Answering the letter of the oracle,	999
	Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about	999
	With this most tender air.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	This hath some seeming.	999
	999
Soothsayer	The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,	999
	Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point	999
	Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,	999
	For many years thought dead, are now revived,	999
	To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue	999
	Promises Britain peace and plenty.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Well	999
	My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,	999
	Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,	999
	And to the Roman empire; promising	999
	To pay our wonted tribute, from the which	999
	We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;	999
	Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,	999
	Have laid most heavy hand.	999
	999
Soothsayer	The fingers of the powers above do tune	999
	The harmony of this peace. The vision	999
	Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke	999
	Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant	999
	Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,	999
	From south to west on wing soaring aloft,	999
	Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun	999
	So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,	999
	The imperial Caesar, should again unite	999
	His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,	999
	Which shines here in the west.	999
	999
CYMBELINE	Laud we the gods;	999
	And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils	999
	From our blest altars. Publish we this peace	999
	To all our subjects. Set we forward: let	999
	A Roman and a British ensign wave	999
	Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:	999
	And in the temple of great Jupiter	999
	Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.	999
	Set on there! Never was a war did cease,	999
	Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.	999

	[FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO]	999
	999
BERNARDO	Who's there?	999

BERNARDO	'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.	999
	999

	999
BERNARDO	Have you had quiet guard?	999

FRANCISCO	Not a mouse stirring.	999
	999
BERNARDO	Well, good night.	999
	If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,	999

	999
FRANCISCO	I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?	999
	999
	[Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS]	999
	999
HORATIO	Friends to this ground.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	And liegemen to the Dane.	999
	999
FRANCISCO	Give you good night.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	O, farewell, honest soldier:	999
	Who hath relieved you?	999
	999
FRANCISCO	Bernardo has my place.	999
	Give you good night.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
MARCELLUS	Holla! Bernardo!	999
	999
BERNARDO	Say,	999
	What, is Horatio there?	999
	999
HORATIO	A piece of him.	999
	999
BERNARDO	Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?	999
	999
BERNARDO	I have seen nothing.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,	999
	And will not let belief take hold of him	999
	Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:	999
	Therefore I have entreated him along	999
	With us to watch the minutes of this night;	999
	That if again this apparition come,	999
	He may approve our eyes and speak to it.	999
	999
HORATIO	Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.	999
	999
BERNARDO	Sit down awhile;	999
	And let us once again assail your ears,	999
	That are so fortified against our story	999
	What we have two nights seen.	999
	999
HORATIO	Well, sit we down,	999
	And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.	999
	999
BERNARDO	Last night of all,	999
	When yond same star that's westward from the pole	999
	Had made his course to illume that part of heaven	999
	Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,	999
	The bell then beating one,--	999
	999
	[Enter Ghost]	999
	999
MARCELLUS	Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!	999
	999
BERNARDO	In the same figure, like the king that's dead.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.	999
	999
BERNARDO	Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.	999
	999
HORATIO	Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.	999
	999
BERNARDO	It would be spoke to.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	Question it, Horatio.	999
	999
HORATIO	What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,	999
	Together with that fair and warlike form	999
	In which the majesty of buried Denmark	999
	Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!	999
	999
MARCELLUS	It is offended.	999
	999
BERNARDO	                  See, it stalks away!	999
	999
HORATIO	Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!	999
	999
	[Exit Ghost]	999
	999
MARCELLUS	'Tis gone, and will not answer.	999
	999
BERNARDO	How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:	999
	Is not this something more than fantasy?	999
	What think you on't?	999
	999
HORATIO	Before my God, I might not this believe	999
	Without the sensible and true avouch	999
	Of mine own eyes.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	                  Is it not like the king?	999
	999
HORATIO	As thou art to thyself:	999
	Such was the very armour he had on	999
	When he the ambitious Norway combated;	999
	So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,	999
	He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.	999
	'Tis strange.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,	999
	With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.	999
	999
HORATIO	In what particular thought to work I know not;	999
	But in the gross and scope of my opinion,	999
	This bodes some strange eruption to our state.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,	999
	Why this same strict and most observant watch	999
	So nightly toils the subject of the land,	999
	And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,	999
	And foreign mart for implements of war;	999
	Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task	999
	Does not divide the Sunday from the week;	999
	What might be toward, that this sweaty haste	999
	Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:	999
	Who is't that can inform me?	999
	999
HORATIO	That can I;	999
	At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,	999
	Whose image even but now appear'd to us,	999
	Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,	999
	Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,	999
	Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--	999
	For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--	999
	Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,	999
	Well ratified by law and heraldry,	999
	Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands	999
	Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:	999
	Against the which, a moiety competent	999
	Was gaged by our king; which had return'd	999
	To the inheritance of Fortinbras,	999
	Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,	999
	And carriage of the article design'd,	999
	His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,	999
	Of unimproved mettle hot and full,	999
	Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there	999
	Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,	999
	For food and diet, to some enterprise	999
	That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--	999
	As it doth well appear unto our state--	999
	But to recover of us, by strong hand	999
	And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands	999
	So by his father lost: and this, I take it,	999
	Is the main motive of our preparations,	999
	The source of this our watch and the chief head	999
	Of this post-haste and romage in the land.	999
	999
BERNARDO	I think it be no other but e'en so:	999
	Well may it sort that this portentous figure	999
	Comes armed through our watch; so like the king	999
	That was and is the question of these wars.	999
	999
HORATIO	A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.	999
	In the most high and palmy state of Rome,	999
	A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,	999
	The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead	999
	Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:	999
	As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,	999
	Disasters in the sun; and the moist star	999
	Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands	999
	Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:	999
	And even the like precurse of fierce events,	999
	As harbingers preceding still the fates	999
	And prologue to the omen coming on,	999
	Have heaven and earth together demonstrated	999
	Unto our climatures and countrymen.--	999
	But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!	999
	999
	[Re-enter Ghost]	999
	999
	I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!	999
	If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,	999
	Speak to me:	999
	If there be any good thing to be done,	999
	That may to thee do ease and grace to me,	999
	Speak to me:	999
	999
	[Cock crows]	999
	999
	If thou art privy to thy country's fate,	999
	Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!	999
	Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life	999
	Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,	999
	For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,	999
	Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?	999
	999
HORATIO	Do, if it will not stand.	999
	999
BERNARDO	'Tis here!	999
	999
HORATIO	'Tis here!	999
	999
MARCELLUS	'Tis gone!	999
	999
	[Exit Ghost]	999
	999
	We do it wrong, being so majestical,	999
	To offer it the show of violence;	999
	For it is, as the air, invulnerable,	999
	And our vain blows malicious mockery.	999
	999
BERNARDO	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.	999
	999
HORATIO	And then it started like a guilty thing	999
	Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,	999
	The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,	999
	Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat	999
	Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,	999
	Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,	999
	The extravagant and erring spirit hies	999
	To his confine: and of the truth herein	999
	This present object made probation.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	It faded on the crowing of the cock.	999
	Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes	999
	Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,	999
	The bird of dawning singeth all night long:	999
	And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;	999
	The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,	999
	No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,	999
	So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.	999
	999
HORATIO	So have I heard and do in part believe it.	999
	But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,	999
	Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:	999
	Break we our watch up; and by my advice,	999
	Let us impart what we have seen to-night	999
	Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,	999
	This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.	999
	Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,	999
	As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?	999
	999
MARCELLUS	Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know	999
	Where we shall find him most conveniently.	999

SCENE II	A room of state in the castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,	999
	POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,	999
	and Attendants]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death	999
	The memory be green, and that it us befitted	999
	To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom	999
	To be contracted in one brow of woe,	999
	Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature	999
	That we with wisest sorrow think on him,	999
	Together with remembrance of ourselves.	999
	Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,	999
	The imperial jointress to this warlike state,	999
	Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--	999
	With an auspicious and a dropping eye,	999
	With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,	999
	In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--	999
	Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd	999
	Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone	999
	With this affair along. For all, our thanks.	999
	Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,	999
	Holding a weak supposal of our worth,	999
	Or thinking by our late dear brother's death	999
	Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,	999
	Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,	999
	He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,	999
	Importing the surrender of those lands	999
	Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,	999
	To our most valiant brother. So much for him.	999
	Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:	999
	Thus much the business is: we have here writ	999
	To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--	999
	Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears	999
	Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress	999
	His further gait herein; in that the levies,	999
	The lists and full proportions, are all made	999
	Out of his subject: and we here dispatch	999
	You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,	999
	For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;	999
	Giving to you no further personal power	999
	To business with the king, more than the scope	999
	Of these delated articles allow.	999
	Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.	999
	999
	999
CORNELIUS	|	999
	|  In that and all things will we show our duty.	999
VOLTIMAND	|	999
	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.	999
	999
	[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]	999
	999
	And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?	999
	You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?	999
	You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,	999
	And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,	999
	That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?	999
	The head is not more native to the heart,	999
	The hand more instrumental to the mouth,	999
	Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.	999
	What wouldst thou have, Laertes?	999
	999
LAERTES	My dread lord,	999
	Your leave and favour to return to France;	999
	From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,	999
	To show my duty in your coronation,	999
	Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,	999
	My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France	999
	And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave	999
	By laboursome petition, and at last	999
	Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:	999
	I do beseech you, give him leave to go.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,	999
	And thy best graces spend it at thy will!	999
	But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--	999
	999
HAMLET	[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?	999
	999
HAMLET	Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,	999
	And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.	999
	Do not for ever with thy vailed lids	999
	Seek for thy noble father in the dust:	999
	Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,	999
	Passing through nature to eternity.	999
	999
HAMLET	Ay, madam, it is common.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	If it be,	999
	Why seems it so particular with thee?	999
	999
HAMLET	Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'	999
	'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,	999
	Nor customary suits of solemn black,	999
	Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,	999
	No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,	999
	Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,	999
	Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,	999
	That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,	999
	For they are actions that a man might play:	999
	But I have that within which passeth show;	999
	These but the trappings and the suits of woe.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,	999
	To give these mourning duties to your father:	999
	But, you must know, your father lost a father;	999
	That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound	999
	In filial obligation for some term	999
	To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever	999
	In obstinate condolement is a course	999
	Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;	999
	It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,	999
	A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,	999
	An understanding simple and unschool'd:	999
	For what we know must be and is as common	999
	As any the most vulgar thing to sense,	999
	Why should we in our peevish opposition	999
	Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,	999
	A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,	999
	To reason most absurd: whose common theme	999
	Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,	999
	From the first corse till he that died to-day,	999
	'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth	999
	This unprevailing woe, and think of us	999
	As of a father: for let the world take note,	999
	You are the most immediate to our throne;	999
	And with no less nobility of love	999
	Than that which dearest father bears his son,	999
	Do I impart toward you. For your intent	999
	In going back to school in Wittenberg,	999
	It is most retrograde to our desire:	999
	And we beseech you, bend you to remain	999
	Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,	999
	Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:	999
	I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.	999
	999
HAMLET	I shall in all my best obey you, madam.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:	999
	Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;	999
	This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet	999
	Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,	999
	No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,	999
	But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,	999
	And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,	999
	Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but HAMLET]	999
	999
HAMLET	O, that this too too solid flesh would melt	999
	Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!	999
	Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd	999
	His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!	999
	How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,	999
	Seem to me all the uses of this world!	999
	Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,	999
	That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature	999
	Possess it merely. That it should come to this!	999
	But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:	999
	So excellent a king; that was, to this,	999
	Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother	999
	That he might not beteem the winds of heaven	999
	Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!	999
	Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,	999
	As if increase of appetite had grown	999
	By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--	999
	Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--	999
	A little month, or ere those shoes were old	999
	With which she follow'd my poor father's body,	999
	Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--	999
	O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,	999
	Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,	999
	My father's brother, but no more like my father	999
	Than I to Hercules: within a month:	999
	Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears	999
	Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,	999
	She married. O, most wicked speed, to post	999
	With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!	999
	It is not nor it cannot come to good:	999
	But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.	999
	999
	[Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO]	999
	999
HORATIO	Hail to your lordship!	999
	999
HAMLET	I am glad to see you well:	999
	Horatio,--or I do forget myself.	999
	999
HORATIO	The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.	999
	999
HAMLET	Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:	999
	And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?	999
	999
MARCELLUS	My good lord--	999
	999
HAMLET	I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.	999
	But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?	999
	999
HORATIO	A truant disposition, good my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	I would not hear your enemy say so,	999
	Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,	999
	To make it truster of your own report	999
	Against yourself: I know you are no truant.	999
	But what is your affair in Elsinore?	999
	We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.	999
	999
HORATIO	My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.	999
	999
HAMLET	I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;	999
	I think it was to see my mother's wedding.	999
	999
HORATIO	Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.	999
	999
HAMLET	Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats	999
	Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.	999
	Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven	999
	Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!	999
	My father!--methinks I see my father.	999
	999
HORATIO	Where, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	                  In my mind's eye, Horatio.	999
	999
HORATIO	I saw him once; he was a goodly king.	999
	999
HAMLET	He was a man, take him for all in all,	999
	I shall not look upon his like again.	999
	999
HORATIO	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.	999
	999
HAMLET	Saw? who?	999
	999
HORATIO	My lord, the king your father.	999
	999
HAMLET	The king my father!	999
	999
HORATIO	Season your admiration for awhile	999
	With an attent ear, till I may deliver,	999
	Upon the witness of these gentlemen,	999
	This marvel to you.	999
	999
HAMLET	For God's love, let me hear.	999
	999
HORATIO	Two nights together had these gentlemen,	999
	Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,	999
	In the dead vast and middle of the night,	999
	Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,	999
	Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,	999
	Appears before them, and with solemn march	999
	Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd	999
	By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,	999
	Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled	999
	Almost to jelly with the act of fear,	999
	Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me	999
	In dreadful secrecy impart they did;	999
	And I with them the third night kept the watch;	999
	Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,	999
	Form of the thing, each word made true and good,	999
	The apparition comes: I knew your father;	999
	These hands are not more like.	999
	999
HAMLET	But where was this?	999
	999
MARCELLUS	My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.	999
	999
HAMLET	Did you not speak to it?	999
	999
HORATIO	My lord, I did;	999
	But answer made it none: yet once methought	999
	It lifted up its head and did address	999
	Itself to motion, like as it would speak;	999
	But even then the morning cock crew loud,	999
	And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,	999
	And vanish'd from our sight.	999
	999
HAMLET	'Tis very strange.	999
	999
HORATIO	As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;	999
	And we did think it writ down in our duty	999
	To let you know of it.	999
	999
HAMLET	Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.	999
	Hold you the watch to-night?	999
	999
	999
MARCELLUS	|	999
	|	We do, my lord.	999
BERNARDO	|	999
	999
	999
HAMLET	Arm'd, say you?	999
	999
	999
MARCELLUS	|	999
	|  Arm'd, my lord.	999
BERNARDO	|	999
	999
	999
HAMLET	From top to toe?	999
	999
	999
MARCELLUS	|	999
	|             My lord, from head to foot.	999
BERNARDO	|	999
	999
	999
HAMLET	Then saw you not his face?	999
	999
HORATIO	O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.	999
	999
HAMLET	What, look'd he frowningly?	999
	999
HORATIO	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.	999
	999
HAMLET	Pale or red?	999
	999
HORATIO	Nay, very pale.	999
	999
HAMLET	                  And fix'd his eyes upon you?	999
	999
HORATIO	Most constantly.	999
	999
HAMLET	                  I would I had been there.	999
	999
HORATIO	It would have much amazed you.	999
	999
HAMLET	Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?	999
	999
HORATIO	While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.	999
	999
	999
MARCELLUS	|	999
	| Longer, longer.	999
BERNARDO	|	999
	999
	999
HORATIO	Not when I saw't.	999
	999
HAMLET	                  His beard was grizzled--no?	999
	999
HORATIO	It was, as I have seen it in his life,	999
	A sable silver'd.	999
	999
HAMLET	                  I will watch to-night;	999
	Perchance 'twill walk again.	999
	999
HORATIO	I warrant it will.	999
	999
HAMLET	If it assume my noble father's person,	999
	I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape	999
	And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,	999
	If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,	999
	Let it be tenable in your silence still;	999
	And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,	999
	Give it an understanding, but no tongue:	999
	I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:	999
	Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,	999
	I'll visit you.	999
	999
All	                  Our duty to your honour.	999
	999
HAMLET	Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but HAMLET]	999
	999
	My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;	999
	I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!	999
	Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,	999
	Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.	999

	999
SCENE III	A room in Polonius' house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA]	999
	999
LAERTES	My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:	999
	And, sister, as the winds give benefit	999
	And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,	999
	But let me hear from you.	999
	999
OPHELIA	Do you doubt that?	999
	999
LAERTES	For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,	999
	Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,	999
	A violet in the youth of primy nature,	999
	Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,	999
	The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.	999
	999
OPHELIA	       No more but so?	999
	999
LAERTES	Think it no more;	999
	For nature, crescent, does not grow alone	999
	In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,	999
	The inward service of the mind and soul	999
	Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,	999
	And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch	999
	The virtue of his will: but you must fear,	999
	His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;	999
	For he himself is subject to his birth:	999
	He may not, as unvalued persons do,	999
	Carve for himself; for on his choice depends	999
	The safety and health of this whole state;	999
	And therefore must his choice be circumscribed	999
	Unto the voice and yielding of that body	999
	Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,	999
	It fits your wisdom so far to believe it	999
	As he in his particular act and place	999
	May give his saying deed; which is no further	999
	Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.	999
	Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,	999
	If with too credent ear you list his songs,	999
	Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open	999
	To his unmaster'd importunity.	999
	Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,	999
	And keep you in the rear of your affection,	999
	Out of the shot and danger of desire.	999
	The chariest maid is prodigal enough,	999
	If she unmask her beauty to the moon:	999
	Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:	999
	The canker galls the infants of the spring,	999
	Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,	999
	And in the morn and liquid dew of youth	999
	Contagious blastments are most imminent.	999
	Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:	999
	Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.	999
	999
OPHELIA	I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,	999
	As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,	999
	Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,	999
	Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;	999
	Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,	999
	Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,	999
	And recks not his own rede.	999
	999
LAERTES	O, fear me not.	999
	I stay too long: but here my father comes.	999
	999
	[Enter POLONIUS]	999
	999
	A double blessing is a double grace,	999
	Occasion smiles upon a second leave.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!	999
	The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,	999
	And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!	999
	And these few precepts in thy memory	999
	See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,	999
	Nor any unproportioned thought his act.	999
	Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.	999
	Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,	999
	Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;	999
	But do not dull thy palm with entertainment	999
	Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware	999
	Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,	999
	Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.	999
	Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;	999
	Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.	999
	Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,	999
	But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;	999
	For the apparel oft proclaims the man,	999
	And they in France of the best rank and station	999
	Are of a most select and generous chief in that.	999
	Neither a borrower nor a lender be;	999
	For loan oft loses both itself and friend,	999
	And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.	999
	This above all: to thine ownself be true,	999
	And it must follow, as the night the day,	999
	Thou canst not then be false to any man.	999
	Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!	999
	999
LAERTES	Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	The time invites you; go; your servants tend.	999
	999
LAERTES	Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well	999
	What I have said to you.	999
	999
OPHELIA	'Tis in my memory lock'd,	999
	And you yourself shall keep the key of it.	999
	999
LAERTES	Farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?	999
	999
OPHELIA	So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well bethought:	999
	'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late	999
	Given private time to you; and you yourself	999
	Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:	999
	If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,	999
	And that in way of caution, I must tell you,	999
	You do not understand yourself so clearly	999
	As it behoves my daughter and your honour.	999
	What is between you? give me up the truth.	999
	999
OPHELIA	He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders	999
	Of his affection to me.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,	999
	Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.	999
	Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?	999
	999
OPHELIA	I do not know, my lord, what I should think.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;	999
	That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,	999
	Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;	999
	Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,	999
	Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.	999
	999
OPHELIA	My lord, he hath importuned me with love	999
	In honourable fashion.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.	999
	999
OPHELIA	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,	999
	With almost all the holy vows of heaven.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,	999
	When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul	999
	Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,	999
	Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,	999
	Even in their promise, as it is a-making,	999
	You must not take for fire. From this time	999
	Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;	999
	Set your entreatments at a higher rate	999
	Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,	999
	Believe so much in him, that he is young	999
	And with a larger tether may he walk	999
	Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,	999
	Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,	999
	Not of that dye which their investments show,	999
	But mere implorators of unholy suits,	999
	Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,	999
	The better to beguile. This is for all:	999
	I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,	999
	Have you so slander any moment leisure,	999
	As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.	999
	Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.	999
	999
OPHELIA	I shall obey, my lord.	999

	999
HORATIO	Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season	999
	Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.	999
	999
	[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within]	999
	999
	What does this mean, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,	999
	Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;	999
	And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,	999
	The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out	999
	The triumph of his pledge.	999
	999
HORATIO	Is it a custom?	999
	999
HAMLET	Ay, marry, is't:	999
	But to my mind, though I am native here	999
	And to the manner born, it is a custom	999
	More honour'd in the breach than the observance.	999
	This heavy-headed revel east and west	999
	Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:	999
	They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase	999
	Soil our addition; and indeed it takes	999
	From our achievements, though perform'd at height,	999
	The pith and marrow of our attribute.	999
	So, oft it chances in particular men,	999
	That for some vicious mole of nature in them,	999
	As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,	999
	Since nature cannot choose his origin--	999
	By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,	999
	Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,	999
	Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens	999
	The form of plausive manners, that these men,	999
	Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,	999
	Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--	999
	Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,	999
	As infinite as man may undergo--	999
	Shall in the general censure take corruption	999
	From that particular fault: the dram of eale	999
	Doth all the noble substance of a doubt	999
	To his own scandal.	999
	999
HORATIO	Look, my lord, it comes!	999
	999
	[Enter Ghost]	999
	999
HAMLET	Angels and ministers of grace defend us!	999
	Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,	999
	Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,	999
	Be thy intents wicked or charitable,	999
	Thou comest in such a questionable shape	999
	That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,	999
	King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!	999
	Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell	999
	Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,	999
	Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,	999
	Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,	999
	Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,	999
	To cast thee up again. What may this mean,	999
	That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel	999
	Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,	999
	Making night hideous; and we fools of nature	999
	So horridly to shake our disposition	999
	With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?	999
	Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?	999
	999
	[Ghost beckons HAMLET]	999
	999
HORATIO	It beckons you to go away with it,	999
	As if it some impartment did desire	999
	To you alone.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	                  Look, with what courteous action	999
	It waves you to a more removed ground:	999
	But do not go with it.	999
	999
HORATIO	No, by no means.	999
	999
HAMLET	It will not speak; then I will follow it.	999
	999
HORATIO	Do not, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	                  Why, what should be the fear?	999
	I do not set my life in a pin's fee;	999
	And for my soul, what can it do to that,	999
	Being a thing immortal as itself?	999
	It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.	999
	999
HORATIO	What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,	999
	Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff	999
	That beetles o'er his base into the sea,	999
	And there assume some other horrible form,	999
	Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason	999
	And draw you into madness? think of it:	999
	The very place puts toys of desperation,	999
	Without more motive, into every brain	999
	That looks so many fathoms to the sea	999
	And hears it roar beneath.	999
	999
HAMLET	It waves me still.	999
	Go on; I'll follow thee.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	You shall not go, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Hold off your hands.	999
	999
HORATIO	Be ruled; you shall not go.	999
	999
HAMLET	My fate cries out,	999
	And makes each petty artery in this body	999
	As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.	999
	Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.	999
	By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!	999
	I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET]	999
	999
HORATIO	He waxes desperate with imagination.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.	999
	999
HORATIO	Have after. To what issue will this come?	999
	999
MARCELLUS	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.	999
	999
HORATIO	Heaven will direct it.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	Nay, let's follow him.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

	HAMLET	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE V	Another part of the platform.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter GHOST and HAMLET]	999
	999
HAMLET	Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.	999
	999
Ghost	Mark me.	999
	999
HAMLET	       I will.	999
	999
Ghost	                  My hour is almost come,	999
	When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames	999
	Must render up myself.	999
	999
HAMLET	Alas, poor ghost!	999
	999
Ghost	Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing	999
	To what I shall unfold.	999
	999
HAMLET	Speak; I am bound to hear.	999
	999
Ghost	 So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.	999
	999
HAMLET	What?	999
	999
Ghost	I am thy father's spirit,	999
	Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,	999
	And for the day confined to fast in fires,	999
	Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature	999
	Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid	999
	To tell the secrets of my prison-house,	999
	I could a tale unfold whose lightest word	999
	Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,	999
	Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,	999
	Thy knotted and combined locks to part	999
	And each particular hair to stand on end,	999
	Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:	999
	But this eternal blazon must not be	999
	To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!	999
	If thou didst ever thy dear father love--	999
	999
HAMLET	O God!	999
	999
Ghost	Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.	999
	999
HAMLET	Murder!	999
	999
Ghost	Murder most foul, as in the best it is;	999
	But this most foul, strange and unnatural.	999
	999
HAMLET	Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift	999
	As meditation or the thoughts of love,	999
	May sweep to my revenge.	999
	999
Ghost	I find thee apt;	999
	And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed	999
	That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,	999
	Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:	999
	'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,	999
	A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark	999
	Is by a forged process of my death	999
	Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,	999
	The serpent that did sting thy father's life	999
	Now wears his crown.	999
	999
HAMLET	O my prophetic soul! My uncle!	999
	999
Ghost	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,	999
	With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--	999
	O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power	999
	So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust	999
	The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:	999
	O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!	999
	From me, whose love was of that dignity	999
	That it went hand in hand even with the vow	999
	I made to her in marriage, and to decline	999
	Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor	999
	To those of mine!	999
	But virtue, as it never will be moved,	999
	Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,	999
	So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,	999
	Will sate itself in a celestial bed,	999
	And prey on garbage.	999
	But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;	999
	Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,	999
	My custom always of the afternoon,	999
	Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,	999
	With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,	999
	And in the porches of my ears did pour	999
	The leperous distilment; whose effect	999
	Holds such an enmity with blood of man	999
	That swift as quicksilver it courses through	999
	The natural gates and alleys of the body,	999
	And with a sudden vigour doth posset	999
	And curd, like eager droppings into milk,	999
	The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;	999
	And a most instant tetter bark'd about,	999
	Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,	999
	All my smooth body.	999
	Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand	999
	Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:	999
	Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,	999
	Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,	999
	No reckoning made, but sent to my account	999
	With all my imperfections on my head:	999
	O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!	999
	If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;	999
	Let not the royal bed of Denmark be	999
	A couch for luxury and damned incest.	999
	But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,	999
	Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive	999
	Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven	999
	And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,	999
	To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!	999
	The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,	999
	And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:	999
	Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HAMLET	O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?	999
	And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;	999
	And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,	999
	But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!	999
	Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat	999
	In this distracted globe. Remember thee!	999
	Yea, from the table of my memory	999
	I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,	999
	All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,	999
	That youth and observation copied there;	999
	And thy commandment all alone shall live	999
	Within the book and volume of my brain,	999
	Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!	999
	O most pernicious woman!	999
	O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!	999
	My tables,--meet it is I set it down,	999
	That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;	999
	At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:	999
	999
	[Writing]	999
	999
	So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;	999
	It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'	999
	I have sworn 't.	999
	999
	999
MARCELLUS	|	999

HORATIO	|	999
	999
	999
MARCELLUS	[Within]	Lord Hamlet,--	999
	999
HORATIO	[Within]	Heaven secure him!	999
	999
HAMLET	So be it!	999
	999
HORATIO	[Within]  Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!	999
	999
HAMLET	Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.	999
	999
	[Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS]	999
	999
MARCELLUS	How is't, my noble lord?	999
	999
HORATIO	What news, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	O, wonderful!	999
	999
HORATIO	                  Good my lord, tell it.	999
	999
HAMLET	No; you'll reveal it.	999
	999
HORATIO	Not I, my lord, by heaven.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	Nor I, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?	999
	But you'll be secret?	999
	999
	999
HORATIO	|	999
	|                   Ay, by heaven, my lord.	999
MARCELLUS	|	999
	999
	999
HAMLET	There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark	999
	But he's an arrant knave.	999
	999
HORATIO	There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave	999
	To tell us this.	999
	999
HAMLET	                  Why, right; you are i' the right;	999
	And so, without more circumstance at all,	999
	I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:	999
	You, as your business and desire shall point you;	999
	For every man has business and desire,	999
	Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,	999
	Look you, I'll go pray.	999
	999
HORATIO	These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;	999
	Yes, 'faith heartily.	999
	999
HORATIO	There's no offence, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,	999
	And much offence too. Touching this vision here,	999
	It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:	999
	For your desire to know what is between us,	999
	O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,	999
	As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,	999
	Give me one poor request.	999
	999
HORATIO	What is't, my lord? we will.	999
	999
HAMLET	Never make known what you have seen to-night.	999
	999
	999
HORATIO	|	999
	| My lord, we will not.	999
MARCELLUS	|	999
	999
	999
HAMLET	Nay, but swear't.	999
	999
HORATIO	In faith,	999
	My lord, not I.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	                  Nor I, my lord, in faith.	999
	999
HAMLET	Upon my sword.	999
	999
MARCELLUS	                  We have sworn, my lord, already.	999
	999
HAMLET	Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.	999
	999
Ghost	[Beneath]  Swear.	999
	999
HAMLET	Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,	999
	truepenny?	999
	Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--	999
	Consent to swear.	999
	999
HORATIO	                  Propose the oath, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Never to speak of this that you have seen,	999
	Swear by my sword.	999
	999
Ghost	[Beneath]  Swear.	999
	999
HAMLET	Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.	999
	Come hither, gentlemen,	999
	And lay your hands again upon my sword:	999
	Never to speak of this that you have heard,	999
	Swear by my sword.	999
	999
Ghost	[Beneath]  Swear.	999
	999
HAMLET	Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?	999
	A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.	999
	999
HORATIO	O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!	999
	999
HAMLET	And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.	999
	There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,	999
	Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;	999
	Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,	999
	How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,	999
	As I perchance hereafter shall think meet	999
	To put an antic disposition on,	999
	That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,	999
	With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,	999
	Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,	999
	As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'	999
	Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'	999
	Or such ambiguous giving out, to note	999
	That you know aught of me: this not to do,	999
	So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.	999
	999
Ghost	[Beneath]  Swear.	999
	999
HAMLET	Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!	999
	999
	[They swear]	999
	999
		        So, gentlemen,	999
	With all my love I do commend me to you:	999
	And what so poor a man as Hamlet is	999
	May do, to express his love and friending to you,	999
	God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;	999
	And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.	999
	The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,	999
	That ever I was born to set it right!	999
	Nay, come, let's go together.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A room in POLONIUS' house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO]	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.	999
	999
REYNALDO	I will, my lord.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,	999
	Before you visit him, to make inquire	999
	Of his behavior.	999
	999
REYNALDO	                  My lord, I did intend it.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,	999
	Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;	999
	And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,	999
	What company, at what expense; and finding	999
	By this encompassment and drift of question	999
	That they do know my son, come you more nearer	999
	Than your particular demands will touch it:	999
	Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;	999
	As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,	999
	And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?	999
	999
REYNALDO	Ay, very well, my lord.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:	999
	But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;	999
	Addicted so and so:' and there put on him	999
	What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank	999
	As may dishonour him; take heed of that;	999
	But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips	999
	As are companions noted and most known	999
	To youth and liberty.	999
	999
REYNALDO	As gaming, my lord.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,	999
	Drabbing: you may go so far.	999
	999
REYNALDO	My lord, that would dishonour him.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge	999
	You must not put another scandal on him,	999
	That he is open to incontinency;	999
	That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly	999
	That they may seem the taints of liberty,	999
	The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,	999
	A savageness in unreclaimed blood,	999
	Of general assault.	999
	999
REYNALDO	But, my good lord,--	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Wherefore should you do this?	999
	999
REYNALDO	Ay, my lord,	999
	I would know that.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	                  Marry, sir, here's my drift;	999
	And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:	999
	You laying these slight sullies on my son,	999
	As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,	999
	Your party in converse, him you would sound,	999
	Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes	999
	The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured	999
	He closes with you in this consequence;	999
	'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'	999
	According to the phrase or the addition	999
	Of man and country.	999
	999
REYNALDO	Very good, my lord.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I	999
	about to say? By the mass, I was about to say	999
	something: where did I leave?	999
	999
REYNALDO	At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'	999
	and 'gentleman.'	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;	999
	He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;	999
	I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,	999
	Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,	999
	There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;	999
	There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,	999
	'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'	999
	Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.	999
	See you now;	999
	Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:	999
	And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,	999
	With windlasses and with assays of bias,	999
	By indirections find directions out:	999
	So by my former lecture and advice,	999
	Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?	999
	999
REYNALDO	My lord, I have.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	                  God be wi' you; fare you well.	999
	999
REYNALDO	Good my lord!	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Observe his inclination in yourself.	999
	999
REYNALDO	I shall, my lord.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	And let him ply his music.	999
	999
REYNALDO	Well, my lord.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Farewell!	999
	999
	[Exit REYNALDO]	999
	999
	[Enter OPHELIA]	999
	999
	How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?	999
	999
OPHELIA	O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	With what, i' the name of God?	999
	999
OPHELIA	My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,	999
	Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;	999
	No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,	999
	Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;	999
	Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;	999
	And with a look so piteous in purport	999
	As if he had been loosed out of hell	999
	To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Mad for thy love?	999
	999
OPHELIA	                  My lord, I do not know;	999
	But truly, I do fear it.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	What said he?	999
	999
OPHELIA	He took me by the wrist and held me hard;	999
	Then goes he to the length of all his arm;	999
	And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,	999
	He falls to such perusal of my face	999
	As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;	999
	At last, a little shaking of mine arm	999
	And thrice his head thus waving up and down,	999
	He raised a sigh so piteous and profound	999
	As it did seem to shatter all his bulk	999
	And end his being: that done, he lets me go:	999
	And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,	999
	He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;	999
	For out o' doors he went without their helps,	999
	And, to the last, bended their light on me.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.	999
	This is the very ecstasy of love,	999
	Whose violent property fordoes itself	999
	And leads the will to desperate undertakings	999
	As oft as any passion under heaven	999
	That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.	999
	What, have you given him any hard words of late?	999
	999
OPHELIA	No, my good lord, but, as you did command,	999
	I did repel his fetters and denied	999
	His access to me.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	                  That hath made him mad.	999
	I am sorry that with better heed and judgment	999
	I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,	999
	And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!	999
	By heaven, it is as proper to our age	999
	To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions	999
	As it is common for the younger sort	999
	To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:	999
	This must be known; which, being kept close, might	999
	move	999
	More grief to hide than hate to utter love.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	A room in the castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ,	999
	GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!	999
	Moreover that we much did long to see you,	999
	The need we have to use you did provoke	999
	Our hasty sending. Something have you heard	999
	Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,	999
	Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man	999
	Resembles that it was. What it should be,	999
	More than his father's death, that thus hath put him	999
	So much from the understanding of himself,	999
	I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,	999
	That, being of so young days brought up with him,	999
	And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,	999
	That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court	999
	Some little time: so by your companies	999
	To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,	999
	So much as from occasion you may glean,	999
	Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,	999
	That, open'd, lies within our remedy.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;	999
	And sure I am two men there are not living	999
	To whom he more adheres. If it will please you	999
	To show us so much gentry and good will	999
	As to expend your time with us awhile,	999
	For the supply and profit of our hope,	999
	Your visitation shall receive such thanks	999
	As fits a king's remembrance.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Both your majesties	999
	Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,	999
	Put your dread pleasures more into command	999
	Than to entreaty.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	                  But we both obey,	999
	And here give up ourselves, in the full bent	999
	To lay our service freely at your feet,	999
	To be commanded.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:	999
	And I beseech you instantly to visit	999
	My too much changed son. Go, some of you,	999
	And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	Heavens make our presence and our practises	999
	Pleasant and helpful to him!	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Ay, amen!	999
	999
	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some	999
	Attendants]	999
	999
	[Enter POLONIUS]	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,	999
	Are joyfully return'd.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Thou still hast been the father of good news.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,	999
	I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,	999
	Both to my God and to my gracious king:	999
	And I do think, or else this brain of mine	999
	Hunts not the trail of policy so sure	999
	As it hath used to do, that I have found	999
	The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Give first admittance to the ambassadors;	999
	My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.	999
	999
	[Exit POLONIUS]	999
	999
	He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found	999
	The head and source of all your son's distemper.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	I doubt it is no other but the main;	999
	His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Well, we shall sift him.	999
	999
	[Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]	999
	999
		   Welcome, my good friends!	999
	Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?	999
	999
VOLTIMAND	Most fair return of greetings and desires.	999
	Upon our first, he sent out to suppress	999
	His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd	999
	To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;	999
	But, better look'd into, he truly found	999
	It was against your highness: whereat grieved,	999
	That so his sickness, age and impotence	999
	Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests	999
	On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;	999
	Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine	999
	Makes vow before his uncle never more	999
	To give the assay of arms against your majesty.	999
	Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,	999
	Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,	999
	And his commission to employ those soldiers,	999
	So levied as before, against the Polack:	999
	With an entreaty, herein further shown,	999
	999
	[Giving a paper]	999
	999
	That it might please you to give quiet pass	999
	Through your dominions for this enterprise,	999
	On such regards of safety and allowance	999
	As therein are set down.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	It likes us well;	999
	And at our more consider'd time well read,	999
	Answer, and think upon this business.	999
	Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:	999
	Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:	999
	Most welcome home!	999
	999
	[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	                  This business is well ended.	999
	My liege, and madam, to expostulate	999
	What majesty should be, what duty is,	999
	Why day is day, night night, and time is time,	999
	Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.	999
	Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,	999
	And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,	999
	I will be brief: your noble son is mad:	999
	Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,	999
	What is't but to be nothing else but mad?	999
	But let that go.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  More matter, with less art.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Madam, I swear I use no art at all.	999
	That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;	999
	And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;	999
	But farewell it, for I will use no art.	999
	Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains	999
	That we find out the cause of this effect,	999
	Or rather say, the cause of this defect,	999
	For this effect defective comes by cause:	999
	Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.	999
	I have a daughter--have while she is mine--	999
	Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,	999
	Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most	999
	beautified Ophelia,'--	999
	That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is	999
	a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Came this from Hamlet to her?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'Doubt thou the stars are fire;	999
	Doubt that the sun doth move;	999
	Doubt truth to be a liar;	999
	But never doubt I love.	999
	'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;	999
	I have not art to reckon my groans: but that	999
	I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.	999
	'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst	999
	this machine is to him, HAMLET.'	999
	This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,	999
	And more above, hath his solicitings,	999
	As they fell out by time, by means and place,	999
	All given to mine ear.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	But how hath she	999
	Received his love?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	                  What do you think of me?	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	As of a man faithful and honourable.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	I would fain prove so. But what might you think,	999
	When I had seen this hot love on the wing--	999
	As I perceived it, I must tell you that,	999
	Before my daughter told me--what might you,	999
	Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,	999
	If I had play'd the desk or table-book,	999
	Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,	999
	Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;	999
	What might you think? No, I went round to work,	999
	And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:	999
	'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;	999
	This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,	999
	That she should lock herself from his resort,	999
	Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.	999
	Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;	999
	And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--	999
	Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,	999
	Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,	999
	Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,	999
	Into the madness wherein now he raves,	999
	And all we mourn for.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Do you think 'tis this?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	It may be, very likely.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--	999
	That I have positively said 'Tis so,'	999
	When it proved otherwise?	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Not that I know.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	[Pointing to his head and shoulder]	999
	999
	Take this from this, if this be otherwise:	999
	If circumstances lead me, I will find	999
	Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed	999
	Within the centre.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	                  How may we try it further?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	You know, sometimes he walks four hours together	999
	Here in the lobby.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  So he does indeed.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:	999
	Be you and I behind an arras then;	999
	Mark the encounter: if he love her not	999
	And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,	999
	Let me be no assistant for a state,	999
	But keep a farm and carters.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	We will try it.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Away, I do beseech you, both away:	999
	I'll board him presently.	999
	999
	[Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and	999
	Attendants]	999
	999
	[Enter HAMLET, reading]	999
	999
		    O, give me leave:	999
	How does my good Lord Hamlet?	999
	999
HAMLET	Well, God-a-mercy.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Do you know me, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Not I, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Then I would you were so honest a man.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Honest, my lord!	999
	999
HAMLET	Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be	999
	one man picked out of ten thousand.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	That's very true, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a	999
	god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	I have, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a	999
	blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.	999
	Friend, look to 't.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on my	999
	daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I	999
	was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and	999
	truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for	999
	love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.	999
	What do you read, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Words, words, words.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	What is the matter, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Between who?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here	999
	that old men have grey beards, that their faces are	999
	wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and	999
	plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of	999
	wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,	999
	though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet	999
	I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for	999
	yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab	999
	you could go backward.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Though this be madness, yet there is method	999
	in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Into my grave.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Indeed, that is out o' the air.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness	999
	that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity	999
	could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will	999
	leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of	999
	meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable	999
	lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.	999
	999
HAMLET	You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will	999
	more willingly part withal: except my life, except	999
	my life, except my life.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Fare you well, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	These tedious old fools!	999
	999
	[Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	[To POLONIUS]  God save you, sir!	999
	999
	[Exit POLONIUS]	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	My honoured lord!	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	My most dear lord!	999
	999
HAMLET	My excellent good friends! How dost thou,	999
	Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	As the indifferent children of the earth.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	Happy, in that we are not over-happy;	999
	On fortune's cap we are not the very button.	999
	999
HAMLET	Nor the soles of her shoe?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Neither, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of	999
	her favours?	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	'Faith, her privates we.	999
	999
HAMLET	In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she	999
	is a strumpet. What's the news?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.	999
	999
HAMLET	Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.	999
	Let me question more in particular: what have you,	999
	my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,	999
	that she sends you to prison hither?	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	Prison, my lord!	999
	999
HAMLET	Denmark's a prison.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Then is the world one.	999
	999
HAMLET	A goodly one; in which there are many confines,	999
	wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	We think not so, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing	999
	either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me	999
	it is a prison.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too	999
	narrow for your mind.	999
	999
HAMLET	O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count	999
	myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I	999
	have bad dreams.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very	999
	substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.	999
	999
HAMLET	A dream itself is but a shadow.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a	999
	quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.	999
	999
HAMLET	Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and	999
	outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we	999
	to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.	999
	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	|	999
	| We'll wait upon you.	999
GUILDENSTERN	|	999
	999
	999
HAMLET	No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest	999
	of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest	999
	man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the	999
	beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.	999
	999
HAMLET	Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I	999
	thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are	999
	too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it	999
	your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,	999
	deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	What should we say, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent	999
	for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks	999
	which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:	999
	I know the good king and queen have sent for you.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	To what end, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by	999
	the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of	999
	our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved	999
	love, and by what more dear a better proposer could	999
	charge you withal, be even and direct with me,	999
	whether you were sent for, or no?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	[Aside to GUILDENSTERN]  What say you?	999
	999
HAMLET	[Aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you	999
	love me, hold not off.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	My lord, we were sent for.	999
	999
HAMLET	I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation	999
	prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king	999
	and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but	999
	wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all	999
	custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily	999
	with my disposition that this goodly frame, the	999
	earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most	999
	excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave	999
	o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted	999
	with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to	999
	me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.	999
	What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!	999
	how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how	999
	express and admirable! in action how like an angel!	999
	in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the	999
	world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,	999
	what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not	999
	me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling	999
	you seem to say so.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.	999
	999
HAMLET	Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what	999
	lenten entertainment the players shall receive from	999
	you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they	999
	coming, to offer you service.	999
	999
HAMLET	He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty	999
	shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight	999
	shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not	999
	sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part	999
	in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose	999
	lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall	999
	say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt	999
	for't. What players are they?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Even those you were wont to take delight in, the	999
	tragedians of the city.	999
	999
HAMLET	How chances it they travel? their residence, both	999
	in reputation and profit, was better both ways.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	I think their inhibition comes by the means of the	999
	late innovation.	999
	999
HAMLET	Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was	999
	in the city? are they so followed?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	No, indeed, are they not.	999
	999
HAMLET	How comes it? do they grow rusty?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but	999
	there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,	999
	that cry out on the top of question, and are most	999
	tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the	999
	fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they	999
	call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of	999
	goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.	999
	999
HAMLET	What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are	999
	they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no	999
	longer than they can sing? will they not say	999
	afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common	999
	players--as it is most like, if their means are no	999
	better--their writers do them wrong, to make them	999
	exclaim against their own succession?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and	999
	the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to	999
	controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid	999
	for argument, unless the poet and the player went to	999
	cuffs in the question.	999
	999
HAMLET	Is't possible?	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	O, there has been much throwing about of brains.	999
	999
HAMLET	Do the boys carry it away?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.	999
	999
HAMLET	It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of	999
	Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while	999
	my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an	999
	hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.	999
	'Sblood, there is something in this more than	999
	natural, if philosophy could find it out.	999
	999
	[Flourish of trumpets within]	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	There are the players.	999
	999
HAMLET	Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,	999
	come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion	999
	and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,	999
	lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,	999
	must show fairly outward, should more appear like	999
	entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my	999
	uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	In what, my dear lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is	999
	southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.	999
	999
	[Enter POLONIUS]	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Well be with you, gentlemen!	999
	999
HAMLET	Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a	999
	hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet	999
	out of his swaddling-clouts.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Happily he's the second time come to them; for they	999
	say an old man is twice a child.	999
	999
HAMLET	I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;	999
	mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;	999
	'twas so indeed.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	My lord, I have news to tell you.	999
	999
HAMLET	My lord, I have news to tell you.	999
	When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	The actors are come hither, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Buz, buz!	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Upon mine honour,--	999
	999
HAMLET	Then came each actor on his ass,--	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,	999
	comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,	999
	historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-	999
	comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or	999
	poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor	999
	Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the	999
	liberty, these are the only men.	999
	999
HAMLET	O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	What a treasure had he, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Why,	999
	'One fair daughter and no more,	999
	The which he loved passing well.'	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Still on my daughter.	999
	999
HAMLET	Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter	999
	that I love passing well.	999
	999
HAMLET	Nay, that follows not.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	What follows, then, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Why,	999
	'As by lot, God wot,'	999
	and then, you know,	999
	'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--	999
	the first row of the pious chanson will show you	999
	more; for look, where my abridgement comes.	999
	999
	[Enter four or five Players]	999
	999
	You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad	999
	to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old	999
	friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:	999
	comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young	999
	lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is	999
	nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the	999
	altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like	999
	apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the	999
	ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en	999
	to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:	999
	we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste	999
	of your quality; come, a passionate speech.	999
	999
First Player	What speech, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was	999
	never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the	999
	play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas	999
	caviare to the general: but it was--as I received	999
	it, and others, whose judgments in such matters	999
	cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well	999
	digested in the scenes, set down with as much	999
	modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there	999
	were no sallets in the lines to make the matter	999
	savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might	999
	indict the author of affectation; but called it an	999
	honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very	999
	much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I	999
	chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and	999
	thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of	999
	Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin	999
	at this line: let me see, let me see--	999
	'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--	999
	it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--	999
	'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,	999
	Black as his purpose, did the night resemble	999
	When he lay couched in the ominous horse,	999
	Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd	999
	With heraldry more dismal; head to foot	999
	Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd	999
	With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,	999
	Baked and impasted with the parching streets,	999
	That lend a tyrannous and damned light	999
	To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,	999
	And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,	999
	With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus	999
	Old grandsire Priam seeks.'	999
	So, proceed you.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and	999
	good discretion.	999
	999
First Player	'Anon he finds him	999
	Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,	999
	Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,	999
	Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,	999
	Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;	999
	But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword	999
	The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,	999
	Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top	999
	Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash	999
	Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,	999
	Which was declining on the milky head	999
	Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:	999
	So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,	999
	And like a neutral to his will and matter,	999
	Did nothing.	999
	But, as we often see, against some storm,	999
	A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,	999
	The bold winds speechless and the orb below	999
	As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder	999
	Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,	999
	Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;	999
	And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall	999
	On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne	999
	With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword	999
	Now falls on Priam.	999
	Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,	999
	In general synod 'take away her power;	999
	Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,	999
	And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,	999
	As low as to the fiends!'	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	This is too long.	999
	999
HAMLET	It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,	999
	say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he	999
	sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.	999
	999
First Player	'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'	999
	999
HAMLET	'The mobled queen?'	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.	999
	999
First Player	'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames	999
	With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head	999
	Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,	999
	About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,	999
	A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;	999
	Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,	999
	'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have	999
	pronounced:	999
	But if the gods themselves did see her then	999
	When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport	999
	In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,	999
	The instant burst of clamour that she made,	999
	Unless things mortal move them not at all,	999
	Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,	999
	And passion in the gods.'	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has	999
	tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.	999
	999
HAMLET	'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.	999
	Good my lord, will you see the players well	999
	bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for	999
	they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the	999
	time: after your death you were better have a bad	999
	epitaph than their ill report while you live.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	My lord, I will use them according to their desert.	999
	999
HAMLET	God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man	999
	after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?	999
	Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less	999
	they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.	999
	Take them in.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Come, sirs.	999
	999
HAMLET	Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.	999
	999
	[Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First]	999
	999
	Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the	999
	Murder of Gonzago?	999
	999
First Player	Ay, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,	999
	study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which	999
	I would set down and insert in't, could you not?	999
	999
First Player	Ay, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him	999
	not.	999
	999
	[Exit First Player]	999
	999
	My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are	999
	welcome to Elsinore.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Good my lord!	999
	999
HAMLET	Ay, so, God be wi' ye;	999
	999
	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
		  Now I am alone.	999
	O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!	999
	Is it not monstrous that this player here,	999
	But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,	999
	Could force his soul so to his own conceit	999
	That from her working all his visage wann'd,	999
	Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,	999
	A broken voice, and his whole function suiting	999
	With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!	999
	For Hecuba!	999
	What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,	999
	That he should weep for her? What would he do,	999
	Had he the motive and the cue for passion	999
	That I have? He would drown the stage with tears	999
	And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,	999
	Make mad the guilty and appal the free,	999
	Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed	999
	The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,	999
	A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,	999
	Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,	999
	And can say nothing; no, not for a king,	999
	Upon whose property and most dear life	999
	A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?	999
	Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?	999
	Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?	999
	Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,	999
	As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?	999
	Ha!	999
	'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be	999
	But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall	999
	To make oppression bitter, or ere this	999
	I should have fatted all the region kites	999
	With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!	999
	Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!	999
	O, vengeance!	999
	Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,	999
	That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,	999
	Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,	999
	Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,	999
	And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,	999
	A scullion!	999
	Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard	999
	That guilty creatures sitting at a play	999
	Have by the very cunning of the scene	999
	Been struck so to the soul that presently	999
	They have proclaim'd their malefactions;	999
	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak	999
	With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players	999
	Play something like the murder of my father	999
	Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;	999
	I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,	999
	I know my course. The spirit that I have seen	999
	May be the devil: and the devil hath power	999
	To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps	999
	Out of my weakness and my melancholy,	999
	As he is very potent with such spirits,	999
	Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds	999
	More relative than this: the play 's the thing	999
	Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.	999

	999
SCENE I	A room in the castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS,	999
	OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	And can you, by no drift of circumstance,	999
	Get from him why he puts on this confusion,	999
	Grating so harshly all his days of quiet	999
	With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	He does confess he feels himself distracted;	999
	But from what cause he will by no means speak.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,	999
	But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,	999
	When we would bring him on to some confession	999
	Of his true state.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  Did he receive you well?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Most like a gentleman.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	But with much forcing of his disposition.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Niggard of question; but, of our demands,	999
	Most free in his reply.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Did you assay him?	999
	To any pastime?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Madam, it so fell out, that certain players	999
	We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;	999
	And there did seem in him a kind of joy	999
	To hear of it: they are about the court,	999
	And, as I think, they have already order	999
	This night to play before him.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	'Tis most true:	999
	And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties	999
	To hear and see the matter.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	With all my heart; and it doth much content me	999
	To hear him so inclined.	999
	Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,	999
	And drive his purpose on to these delights.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	We shall, my lord.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	                  Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;	999
	For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,	999
	That he, as 'twere by accident, may here	999
	Affront Ophelia:	999
	Her father and myself, lawful espials,	999
	Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,	999
	We may of their encounter frankly judge,	999
	And gather by him, as he is behaved,	999
	If 't be the affliction of his love or no	999
	That thus he suffers for.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	I shall obey you.	999
	And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish	999
	That your good beauties be the happy cause	999
	Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues	999
	Will bring him to his wonted way again,	999
	To both your honours.	999
	999
OPHELIA	Madam, I wish it may.	999
	999
	[Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE]	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,	999
	We will bestow ourselves.	999

	[To OPHELIA]	999
	999
		    Read on this book;	999
	That show of such an exercise may colour	999
	Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--	999
	'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage	999
	And pious action we do sugar o'er	999
	The devil himself.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	[Aside]          O, 'tis too true!	999
	How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!	999
	The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,	999
	Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it	999
	Than is my deed to my most painted word:	999
	O heavy burthen!	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.	999
	999
	[Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS]	999
	999
	[Enter HAMLET]	999
	999
HAMLET	To be, or not to be: that is the question:	999
	Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer	999
	The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,	999
	Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,	999
	And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;	999
	No more; and by a sleep to say we end	999
	The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks	999
	That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation	999
	Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;	999
	To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;	999
	For in that sleep of death what dreams may come	999
	When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,	999
	Must give us pause: there's the respect	999
	That makes calamity of so long life;	999
	For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,	999
	The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,	999
	The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,	999
	The insolence of office and the spurns	999
	That patient merit of the unworthy takes,	999
	When he himself might his quietus make	999
	With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,	999
	To grunt and sweat under a weary life,	999
	But that the dread of something after death,	999
	The undiscover'd country from whose bourn	999
	No traveller returns, puzzles the will	999
	And makes us rather bear those ills we have	999
	Than fly to others that we know not of?	999
	Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;	999
	And thus the native hue of resolution	999
	Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,	999
	And enterprises of great pith and moment	999
	With this regard their currents turn awry,	999
	And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!	999
	The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons	999
	Be all my sins remember'd.	999
	999
OPHELIA	Good my lord,	999
	How does your honour for this many a day?	999
	999
HAMLET	I humbly thank you; well, well, well.	999
	999
OPHELIA	My lord, I have remembrances of yours,	999
	That I have longed long to re-deliver;	999
	I pray you, now receive them.	999
	999
HAMLET	No, not I;	999
	I never gave you aught.	999
	999
OPHELIA	My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;	999
	And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed	999
	As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,	999
	Take these again; for to the noble mind	999
	Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.	999
	There, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Ha, ha! are you honest?	999
	999
OPHELIA	My lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Are you fair?	999
	999
OPHELIA	What means your lordship?	999
	999
HAMLET	That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should	999
	admit no discourse to your beauty.	999
	999
OPHELIA	Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than	999
	with honesty?	999
	999
HAMLET	Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner	999
	transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the	999
	force of honesty can translate beauty into his	999
	likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the	999
	time gives it proof. I did love you once.	999
	999
OPHELIA	Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.	999
	999
HAMLET	You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot	999
	so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of	999
	it: I loved you not.	999
	999
OPHELIA	I was the more deceived.	999
	999
HAMLET	Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a	999
	breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;	999
	but yet I could accuse me of such things that it	999
	were better my mother had not borne me: I am very	999
	proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at	999
	my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,	999
	imagination to give them shape, or time to act them	999
	in. What should such fellows as I do crawling	999
	between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,	999
	all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.	999
	Where's your father?	999
	999
OPHELIA	At home, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the	999
	fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.	999
	999
OPHELIA	O, help him, you sweet heavens!	999
	999
HAMLET	If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for	999
	thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as	999
	snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a	999
	nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs	999
	marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough	999
	what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,	999
	and quickly too. Farewell.	999
	999
OPHELIA	O heavenly powers, restore him!	999
	999
HAMLET	I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God	999
	has given you one face, and you make yourselves	999
	another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and	999
	nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness	999
	your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath	999
	made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:	999
	those that are married already, all but one, shall	999
	live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a	999
	nunnery, go.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
OPHELIA	O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!	999
	The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;	999
	The expectancy and rose of the fair state,	999
	The glass of fashion and the mould of form,	999
	The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!	999
	And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,	999
	That suck'd the honey of his music vows,	999
	Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,	999
	Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;	999
	That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth	999
	Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,	999
	To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!	999
	999
	[Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Love! his affections do not that way tend;	999
	Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,	999
	Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,	999
	O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;	999
	And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose	999
	Will be some danger: which for to prevent,	999
	I have in quick determination	999
	Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,	999
	For the demand of our neglected tribute	999
	Haply the seas and countries different	999
	With variable objects shall expel	999
	This something-settled matter in his heart,	999
	Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus	999
	From fashion of himself. What think you on't?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	It shall do well: but yet do I believe	999
	The origin and commencement of his grief	999
	Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!	999
	You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;	999
	We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;	999
	But, if you hold it fit, after the play	999
	Let his queen mother all alone entreat him	999
	To show his grief: let her be round with him;	999
	And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear	999
	Of all their conference. If she find him not,	999
	To England send him, or confine him where	999
	Your wisdom best shall think.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	It shall be so:	999
	Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	A hall in the castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter HAMLET and Players]	999
	999
HAMLET	Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to	999
	you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,	999
	as many of your players do, I had as lief the	999
	town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air	999
	too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;	999
	for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,	999
	the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget	999
	a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it	999
	offends me to the soul to hear a robustious	999
	periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to	999
	very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who	999
	for the most part are capable of nothing but	999
	inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such	999
	a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it	999
	out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.	999
	999
First Player	I warrant your honour.	999
	999
HAMLET	Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion	999
	be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the	999
	word to the action; with this special o'erstep not	999
	the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is	999
	from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the	999
	first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the	999
	mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,	999
	scorn her own image, and the very age and body of	999
	the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,	999
	or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful	999
	laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the	999
	censure of the which one must in your allowance	999
	o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be	999
	players that I have seen play, and heard others	999
	praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,	999
	that, neither having the accent of Christians nor	999
	the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so	999
	strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of	999
	nature's journeymen had made men and not made them	999
	well, they imitated humanity so abominably.	999
	999
First Player	I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,	999
	sir.	999
	999
HAMLET	O, reform it altogether. And let those that play	999
	your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;	999
	for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to	999
	set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh	999
	too; though, in the mean time, some necessary	999
	question of the play be then to be considered:	999
	that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition	999
	in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Players]	999
	999
	[Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
	How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	And the queen too, and that presently.	999
	999
HAMLET	Bid the players make haste.	999
	999
	[Exit POLONIUS]	999
	999
	Will you two help to hasten them?	999
	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	|	999
	|  We will, my lord.	999
GUILDENSTERN	|	999
	999
	999
	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
HAMLET	What ho! Horatio!	999
	999
	[Enter HORATIO]	999
	999
HORATIO	Here, sweet lord, at your service.	999
	999
HAMLET	Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man	999
	As e'er my conversation coped withal.	999
	999
HORATIO	O, my dear lord,--	999
	999
HAMLET	                  Nay, do not think I flatter;	999
	For what advancement may I hope from thee	999
	That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,	999
	To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?	999
	No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,	999
	And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee	999
	Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?	999
	Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice	999
	And could of men distinguish, her election	999
	Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been	999
	As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,	999
	A man that fortune's buffets and rewards	999
	Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those	999
	Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,	999
	That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger	999
	To sound what stop she please. Give me that man	999
	That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him	999
	In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,	999
	As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--	999
	There is a play to-night before the king;	999
	One scene of it comes near the circumstance	999
	Which I have told thee of my father's death:	999
	I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,	999
	Even with the very comment of thy soul	999
	Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt	999
	Do not itself unkennel in one speech,	999
	It is a damned ghost that we have seen,	999
	And my imaginations are as foul	999
	As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;	999
	For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,	999
	And after we will both our judgments join	999
	In censure of his seeming.	999
	999
HORATIO	Well, my lord:	999
	If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,	999
	And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.	999
	999
HAMLET	They are coming to the play; I must be idle:	999
	Get you a place.	999
	999
	[Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS,	999
	QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ,	999
	GUILDENSTERN, and others]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	How fares our cousin Hamlet?	999
	999
HAMLET	Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat	999
	the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words	999
	are not mine.	999
	999
HAMLET	No, nor mine now.	999
	999
	[To POLONIUS]	999
	999
	My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.	999
	999
HAMLET	What did you enact?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the	999
	Capitol; Brutus killed me.	999
	999
HAMLET	It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf	999
	there. Be the players ready?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.	999
	999
HAMLET	No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	[To KING CLAUDIUS]  O, ho! do you mark that?	999
	999
HAMLET	Lady, shall I lie in your lap?	999
	999
	[Lying down at OPHELIA's feet]	999
	999
OPHELIA	No, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	I mean, my head upon your lap?	999
	999
OPHELIA	Ay, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Do you think I meant country matters?	999
	999
OPHELIA	I think nothing, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.	999
	999
OPHELIA	What is, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Nothing.	999
	999
OPHELIA	You are merry, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Who, I?	999
	999
OPHELIA	Ay, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do	999
	but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my	999
	mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.	999
	999
OPHELIA	Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for	999
	I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two	999
	months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's	999
	hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half	999
	a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,	999
	then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with	999
	the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,	999
	the hobby-horse is forgot.'	999
	999
	[Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters]	999
	999
	[Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen	999
	embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes	999
	show of protestation unto him. He takes her up,	999
	and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down	999
	upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep,	999
	leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his	999
	crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's	999
	ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King	999
	dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner,	999
	with some two or three Mutes, comes in again,	999
	seeming to lament with her. The dead body is	999
	carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with	999
	gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but	999
	in the end accepts his love]	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
OPHELIA	What means this, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.	999
	999
OPHELIA	Belike this show imports the argument of the play.	999
	999
	[Enter Prologue]	999
	999
HAMLET	We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot	999
	keep counsel; they'll tell all.	999
	999
OPHELIA	Will he tell us what this show meant?	999
	999
HAMLET	Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you	999
	ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.	999
	999
OPHELIA	You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.	999
	999
Prologue	     For us, and for our tragedy,	999
	Here stooping to your clemency,	999
	We beg your hearing patiently.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HAMLET	Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?	999
	999
OPHELIA	'Tis brief, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	As woman's love.	999
	999
	[Enter two Players, King and Queen]	999
	999
Player King	   Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round	999
	Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,	999
	And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen	999
	About the world have times twelve thirties been,	999
	Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands	999
	Unite commutual in most sacred bands.	999
	999
Player Queen	   So many journeys may the sun and moon	999
	Make us again count o'er ere love be done!	999
	But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,	999
	So far from cheer and from your former state,	999
	That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,	999
	Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:	999
	For women's fear and love holds quantity;	999
	In neither aught, or in extremity.	999
	Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;	999
	And as my love is sized, my fear is so:	999
	Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;	999
	Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.	999
	999
Player King	'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;	999
	My operant powers their functions leave to do:	999
	And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,	999
	Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind	999
	For husband shalt thou--	999
	999
Player Queen	O, confound the rest!	999
	Such love must needs be treason in my breast:	999
	In second husband let me be accurst!	999
	None wed the second but who kill'd the first.	999
	999
HAMLET	[Aside]  Wormwood, wormwood.	999
	999
Player Queen	   The instances that second marriage move	999
	Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:	999
	A second time I kill my husband dead,	999
	When second husband kisses me in bed.	999
	999
Player King	   I do believe you think what now you speak;	999
	But what we do determine oft we break.	999
	Purpose is but the slave to memory,	999
	Of violent birth, but poor validity;	999
	Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;	999
	But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.	999
	Most necessary 'tis that we forget	999
	To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:	999
	What to ourselves in passion we propose,	999
	The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.	999
	The violence of either grief or joy	999
	Their own enactures with themselves destroy:	999
	Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;	999
	Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.	999
	This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange	999
	That even our loves should with our fortunes change;	999
	For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,	999
	Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.	999
	The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;	999
	The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.	999
	And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;	999
	For who not needs shall never lack a friend,	999
	And who in want a hollow friend doth try,	999
	Directly seasons him his enemy.	999
	But, orderly to end where I begun,	999
	Our wills and fates do so contrary run	999
	That our devices still are overthrown;	999
	Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:	999
	So think thou wilt no second husband wed;	999
	But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.	999
	999
Player Queen	   Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!	999
	Sport and repose lock from me day and night!	999
	To desperation turn my trust and hope!	999
	An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!	999
	Each opposite that blanks the face of joy	999
	Meet what I would have well and it destroy!	999
	Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,	999
	If, once a widow, ever I be wife!	999
	999
HAMLET	If she should break it now!	999
	999
Player King	'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;	999
	My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile	999
	The tedious day with sleep.	999
	999
	[Sleeps]	999
	999
Player Queen	Sleep rock thy brain,	999
	And never come mischance between us twain!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HAMLET	Madam, how like you this play?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	The lady protests too much, methinks.	999
	999
HAMLET	O, but she'll keep her word.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?	999
	999
HAMLET	No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence	999
	i' the world.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	What do you call the play?	999
	999
HAMLET	The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play	999
	is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is	999
	the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see	999
	anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'	999
	that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it	999
	touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our	999
	withers are unwrung.	999
	999
	[Enter LUCIANUS]	999
	999
	This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.	999
	999
OPHELIA	You are as good as a chorus, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	I could interpret between you and your love, if I	999
	could see the puppets dallying.	999
	999
OPHELIA	You are keen, my lord, you are keen.	999
	999
HAMLET	It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.	999
	999
OPHELIA	Still better, and worse.	999
	999
HAMLET	So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;	999
	pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:	999
	'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'	999
	999
LUCIANUS	   Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;	999
	Confederate season, else no creature seeing;	999
	Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,	999
	With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,	999
	Thy natural magic and dire property,	999
	On wholesome life usurp immediately.	999
	999
	[Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears]	999
	999
HAMLET	He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His	999
	name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in	999
	choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer	999
	gets the love of Gonzago's wife.	999
	999
OPHELIA	The king rises.	999
	999
HAMLET	What, frighted with false fire!	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	How fares my lord?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Give o'er the play.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Give me some light: away!	999
	999
All	Lights, lights, lights!	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO]	999
	999
HAMLET	     Why, let the stricken deer go weep,	999
	The hart ungalled play;	999
	For some must watch, while some must sleep:	999
	So runs the world away.	999
	Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if	999
	the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two	999
	Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a	999
	fellowship in a cry of players, sir?	999
	999
HORATIO	Half a share.	999
	999
HAMLET	A whole one, I.	999
	For thou dost know, O Damon dear,	999
	This realm dismantled was	999
	Of Jove himself; and now reigns here	999
	A very, very--pajock.	999
	999
HORATIO	You might have rhymed.	999
	999
HAMLET	O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a	999
	thousand pound. Didst perceive?	999
	999
HORATIO	Very well, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Upon the talk of the poisoning?	999
	999
HORATIO	I did very well note him.	999
	999
HAMLET	Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!	999
	For if the king like not the comedy,	999
	Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.	999
	Come, some music!	999
	999
	[Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.	999
	999
HAMLET	Sir, a whole history.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	The king, sir,--	999
	999
HAMLET	Ay, sir, what of him?	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.	999
	999
HAMLET	With drink, sir?	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	No, my lord, rather with choler.	999
	999
HAMLET	Your wisdom should show itself more richer to	999
	signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him	999
	to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far	999
	more choler.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and	999
	start not so wildly from my affair.	999
	999
HAMLET	I am tame, sir: pronounce.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of	999
	spirit, hath sent me to you.	999
	999
HAMLET	You are welcome.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right	999
	breed. If it shall please you to make me a	999
	wholesome answer, I will do your mother's	999
	commandment: if not, your pardon and my return	999
	shall be the end of my business.	999
	999
HAMLET	Sir, I cannot.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	What, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,	999
	sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;	999
	or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no	999
	more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her	999
	into amazement and admiration.	999
	999
HAMLET	O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But	999
	is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's	999
	admiration? Impart.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you	999
	go to bed.	999
	999
HAMLET	We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have	999
	you any further trade with us?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, you once did love me.	999
	999
HAMLET	So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you	999
	do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if	999
	you deny your griefs to your friend.	999
	999
HAMLET	Sir, I lack advancement.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	How can that be, when you have the voice of the king	999
	himself for your succession in Denmark?	999
	999
HAMLET	Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb	999
	is something musty.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Players with recorders]	999
	999
	O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with	999
	you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,	999
	as if you would drive me into a toil?	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too	999
	unmannerly.	999
	999
HAMLET	I do not well understand that. Will you play upon	999
	this pipe?	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	My lord, I cannot.	999
	999
HAMLET	I pray you.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	Believe me, I cannot.	999
	999
HAMLET	I do beseech you.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	I know no touch of it, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with	999
	your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your	999
	mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.	999
	Look you, these are the stops.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	But these cannot I command to any utterance of	999
	harmony; I have not the skill.	999
	999
HAMLET	Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of	999
	me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know	999
	my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my	999
	mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to	999
	the top of my compass: and there is much music,	999
	excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot	999
	you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am	999
	easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what	999
	instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you	999
	cannot play upon me.	999
	999

LORD POLONIUS	My lord, the queen would speak with you, and	999
	presently.	999
	999
HAMLET	Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.	999
	999
HAMLET	Methinks it is like a weasel.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	It is backed like a weasel.	999
	999
HAMLET	Or like a whale?	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	Very like a whale.	999
	999
HAMLET	Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool	999
	me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	I will say so.	999
	999
HAMLET	By and by is easily said.	999

	Tis now the very witching time of night,	999
	When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out	999
	Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,	999
	And do such bitter business as the day	999
	Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.	999
	O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever	999
	The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:	999
	Let me be cruel, not unnatural:	999
	I will speak daggers to her, but use none;	999
	My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;	999

	999
	999
	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	I like him not, nor stands it safe with us	999
	To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;	999
	I your commission will forthwith dispatch,	999
	And he to England shall along with you:	999
	The terms of our estate may not endure	999
	Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow	999
	Out of his lunacies.	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	We will ourselves provide:	999
	Most holy and religious fear it is	999
	To keep those many many bodies safe	999
	That live and feed upon your majesty.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	The single and peculiar life is bound,	999
	With all the strength and armour of the mind,	999
	To keep itself from noyance; but much more	999
	That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest	999
	The lives of many. The cease of majesty	999
	Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw	999
	What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,	999
	Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,	999
	To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things	999
	Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,	999
	Each small annexment, petty consequence,	999
	Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone	999
	Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;	999
	For we will fetters put upon this fear,	999

	[Enter POLONIUS]	999
	999
LORD POLONIUS	My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:	999
	Behind the arras I'll convey myself,	999
	To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:	999
	And, as you said, and wisely was it said,	999
	'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,	999
	Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear	999
	The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:	999
	I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,	999
	And tell you what I know.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Thanks, dear my lord.	999
	999
	[Exit POLONIUS]	999
	999
	O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;	999
	It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,	999
	A brother's murder. Pray can I not,	999
	Though inclination be as sharp as will:	999
	My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;	999
	And, like a man to double business bound,	999
	I stand in pause where I shall first begin,	999
	And both neglect. What if this cursed hand	999
	Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,	999
	Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens	999
	To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy	999
	But to confront the visage of offence?	999
	And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,	999
	To be forestalled ere we come to fall,	999
	Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;	999
	My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer	999
	Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?	999
	That cannot be; since I am still possess'd	999
	Of those effects for which I did the murder,	999
	My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.	999
	May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?	999
	In the corrupted currents of this world	999
	Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,	999
	And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself	999
	Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;	999
	There is no shuffling, there the action lies	999
	In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,	999
	Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,	999
	To give in evidence. What then? what rests?	999
	Try what repentance can: what can it not?	999
	Yet what can it when one can not repent?	999
	O wretched state! O bosom black as death!	999
	O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,	999
	Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!	999
	Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,	999
	Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!	999
	All may be well.	999

HAMLET	Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;	999
	And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;	999
	And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:	999
	A villain kills my father; and for that,	999
	I, his sole son, do this same villain send	999
	To heaven.	999
	O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.	999
	He took my father grossly, full of bread;	999
	With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;	999
	And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?	999
	But in our circumstance and course of thought,	999
	'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,	999
	To take him in the purging of his soul,	999
	When he is fit and season'd for his passage?	999
	No!	999
	Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:	999
	When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,	999
	Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;	999
	At gaming, swearing, or about some act	999
	That has no relish of salvation in't;	999
	Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,	999
	And that his soul may be as damn'd and black	999
	As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:	999
	This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.	999

QUEEN GERTRUDE	Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.	999
	999
HAMLET	Mother, you have my father much offended.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.	999
	999
HAMLET	Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Why, how now, Hamlet!	999
	999
HAMLET	What's the matter now?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Have you forgot me?	999
	999
HAMLET	No, by the rood, not so:	999
	You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;	999
	And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.	999
	999
HAMLET	Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;	999
	You go not till I set you up a glass	999
	Where you may see the inmost part of you.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?	999
	Help, help, ho!	999

	999
HAMLET	Nay, I know not:	999
	Is it the king?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!	999
	999
HAMLET	A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,	999
	As kill a king, and marry with his brother.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	As kill a king!	999
	999
HAMLET	                  Ay, lady, 'twas my word.	999

	[Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS]	999
	999
	Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!	999
	I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;	999
	Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.	999
	Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,	999
	And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,	999
	If it be made of penetrable stuff,	999
	If damned custom have not brass'd it so	999
	That it is proof and bulwark against sense.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue	999
	In noise so rude against me?	999
	999
HAMLET	Such an act	999
	That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,	999
	Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose	999
	From the fair forehead of an innocent love	999
	And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows	999
	As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed	999
	As from the body of contraction plucks	999
	The very soul, and sweet religion makes	999
	A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:	999
	Yea, this solidity and compound mass,	999
	With tristful visage, as against the doom,	999
	Is thought-sick at the act.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Ay me, what act,	999
	That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?	999
	999
HAMLET	Look here, upon this picture, and on this,	999
	The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.	999
	See, what a grace was seated on this brow;	999
	Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;	999
	An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;	999
	A station like the herald Mercury	999
	New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;	999
	A combination and a form indeed,	999
	Where every god did seem to set his seal,	999
	To give the world assurance of a man:	999
	This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:	999
	Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,	999
	Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?	999
	Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,	999
	And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?	999
	You cannot call it love; for at your age	999
	The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,	999
	And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment	999
	Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,	999
	Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense	999
	Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,	999
	Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd	999
	But it reserved some quantity of choice,	999
	To serve in such a difference. What devil was't	999
	That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?	999
	Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,	999
	Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,	999
	Or but a sickly part of one true sense	999
	Could not so mope.	999
	O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,	999
	If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,	999
	To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,	999
	And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame	999
	When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,	999
	Since frost itself as actively doth burn	999
	And reason panders will.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	O Hamlet, speak no more:	999
	Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;	999
	And there I see such black and grained spots	999
	As will not leave their tinct.	999
	999
HAMLET	Nay, but to live	999
	In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,	999
	Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love	999
	Over the nasty sty,--	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	O, speak to me no more;	999
	These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;	999
	No more, sweet Hamlet!	999
	999
HAMLET	A murderer and a villain;	999
	A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe	999
	Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;	999
	A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,	999
	That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,	999
	And put it in his pocket!	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	No more!	999
	999
HAMLET	A king of shreds and patches,--	999
	999
	[Enter Ghost]	999
	999
	Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,	999
	You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alas, he's mad!	999
	999
HAMLET	Do you not come your tardy son to chide,	999
	That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by	999
	The important acting of your dread command? O, say!	999
	999
Ghost	Do not forget: this visitation	999
	Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.	999
	But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:	999
	O, step between her and her fighting soul:	999
	Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:	999
	Speak to her, Hamlet.	999
	999
HAMLET	How is it with you, lady?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alas, how is't with you,	999
	That you do bend your eye on vacancy	999
	And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?	999
	Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;	999
	And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,	999
	Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,	999
	Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,	999
	Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper	999
	Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?	999
	999
HAMLET	On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!	999
	His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,	999
	Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;	999
	Lest with this piteous action you convert	999
	My stern effects: then what I have to do	999
	Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	To whom do you speak this?	999
	999
HAMLET	Do you see nothing there?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.	999
	999
HAMLET	Nor did you nothing hear?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	No, nothing but ourselves.	999
	999
HAMLET	Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!	999
	My father, in his habit as he lived!	999
	Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!	999
	999
	[Exit Ghost]	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	This the very coinage of your brain:	999
	This bodiless creation ecstasy	999
	Is very cunning in.	999
	999
HAMLET	Ecstasy!	999
	My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,	999
	And makes as healthful music: it is not madness	999
	That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,	999
	And I the matter will re-word; which madness	999
	Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,	999
	Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,	999
	That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:	999
	It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,	999
	Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,	999
	Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;	999
	Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;	999
	And do not spread the compost on the weeds,	999
	To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;	999
	For in the fatness of these pursy times	999
	Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,	999
	Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.	999
	999
HAMLET	O, throw away the worser part of it,	999
	And live the purer with the other half.	999
	Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;	999
	Assume a virtue, if you have it not.	999
	That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,	999
	Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,	999
	That to the use of actions fair and good	999
	He likewise gives a frock or livery,	999
	That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,	999
	And that shall lend a kind of easiness	999
	To the next abstinence: the next more easy;	999
	For use almost can change the stamp of nature,	999
	And either [         ] the devil, or throw him out	999
	With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:	999
	And when you are desirous to be bless'd,	999
	I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,	999
	999
	[Pointing to POLONIUS]	999
	999
	I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,	999
	To punish me with this and this with me,	999
	That I must be their scourge and minister.	999
	I will bestow him, and will answer well	999
	The death I gave him. So, again, good night.	999
	I must be cruel, only to be kind:	999
	Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.	999
	One word more, good lady.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	What shall I do?	999
	999
HAMLET	Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:	999
	Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;	999
	Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;	999
	And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,	999
	Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,	999
	Make you to ravel all this matter out,	999
	That I essentially am not in madness,	999
	But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;	999
	For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,	999
	Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,	999
	Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?	999
	No, in despite of sense and secrecy,	999
	Unpeg the basket on the house's top.	999
	Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,	999
	To try conclusions, in the basket creep,	999
	And break your own neck down.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,	999
	And breath of life, I have no life to breathe	999
	What thou hast said to me.	999
	999
HAMLET	I must to England; you know that?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alack,	999
	I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.	999
	999
HAMLET	There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,	999
	Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,	999
	They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,	999
	And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;	999
	For 'tis the sport to have the engineer	999
	Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard	999
	But I will delve one yard below their mines,	999
	And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,	999
	When in one line two crafts directly meet.	999
	This man shall set me packing:	999
	I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.	999
	Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor	999
	Is now most still, most secret and most grave,	999
	Who was in life a foolish prating knave.	999
	Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.	999
	Good night, mother.	999

	999
	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ,	999
	and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:	999
	You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.	999
	Where is your son?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Bestow this place on us a little while.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
	Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend	999
	Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,	999
	Behind the arras hearing something stir,	999
	Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'	999
	And, in this brainish apprehension, kills	999
	The unseen good old man.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	O heavy deed!	999
	It had been so with us, had we been there:	999
	His liberty is full of threats to all;	999
	To you yourself, to us, to every one.	999
	Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?	999
	It will be laid to us, whose providence	999
	Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,	999
	This mad young man: but so much was our love,	999
	We would not understand what was most fit;	999
	But, like the owner of a foul disease,	999
	To keep it from divulging, let it feed	999
	Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:	999
	O'er whom his very madness, like some ore	999
	Among a mineral of metals base,	999
	Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	O Gertrude, come away!	999
	The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,	999
	But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed	999
	We must, with all our majesty and skill,	999
	Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!	999
	999
	[Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
	Friends both, go join you with some further aid:	999
	Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,	999
	And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:	999
	Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body	999
	Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
	Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;	999
	And let them know, both what we mean to do,	999
	And what's untimely done [                ]	999
	Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,	999
	As level as the cannon to his blank,	999
	Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name,	999
	And hit the woundless air. O, come away!	999

GUILDENSTERN:	|	999
	999
	999
HAMLET	What noise? who calls on Hamlet?	999
	O, here they come.	999
	999
	[Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?	999
	999
HAMLET	Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence	999
	And bear it to the chapel.	999
	999
HAMLET	Do not believe it.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Believe what?	999
	999
HAMLET	That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.	999
	Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what	999
	replication should be made by the son of a king?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Take you me for a sponge, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his	999
	rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the	999
	king best service in the end: he keeps them, like	999
	an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to	999
	be last swallowed: when he needs what you have	999
	gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you	999
	shall be dry again.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	I understand you not, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a	999
	foolish ear.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go	999
	with us to the king.	999
	999
HAMLET	The body is with the king, but the king is not with	999
	the body. The king is a thing--	999
	999
GUILDENSTERN	A thing, my lord!	999
	999
HAMLET	Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.	999
	How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!	999
	Yet must not we put the strong law on him:	999
	He's loved of the distracted multitude,	999
	Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;	999
	And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,	999
	But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,	999
	This sudden sending him away must seem	999
	Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown	999
	By desperate appliance are relieved,	999
	Or not at all.	999
	999
	[Enter ROSENCRANTZ]	999
	999
	How now! what hath befall'n?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,	999
	We cannot get from him.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	But where is he?	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Bring him before us.	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.	999
	999
	[Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?	999
	999
HAMLET	At supper.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	At supper! where?	999
	999
HAMLET	Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain	999
	convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your	999
	worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all	999
	creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for	999
	maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but	999
	variable service, two dishes, but to one table:	999
	that's the end.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Alas, alas!	999
	999
HAMLET	A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a	999
	king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	What dost you mean by this?	999
	999
HAMLET	Nothing but to show you how a king may go a	999
	progress through the guts of a beggar.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Where is Polonius?	999
	999
HAMLET	In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger	999
	find him not there, seek him i' the other place	999
	yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within	999
	this month, you shall nose him as you go up the	999
	stairs into the lobby.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Go seek him there.	999
	999
	[To some Attendants]	999
	999
HAMLET	He will stay till ye come.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Attendants]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--	999
	Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve	999
	For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence	999
	With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;	999
	The bark is ready, and the wind at help,	999
	The associates tend, and every thing is bent	999
	For England.	999
	999
HAMLET	                  For England!	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Ay, Hamlet.	999
	999
HAMLET	Good.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.	999
	999
HAMLET	I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for	999
	England! Farewell, dear mother.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Thy loving father, Hamlet.	999
	999
HAMLET	My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man	999
	and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;	999
	Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:	999
	Away! for every thing is seal'd and done	999
	That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]	999
	999
	And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--	999
	As my great power thereof may give thee sense,	999
	Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red	999
	After the Danish sword, and thy free awe	999
	Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set	999
	Our sovereign process; which imports at full,	999
	By letters congruing to that effect,	999
	The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;	999
	For like the hectic in my blood he rages,	999
	And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,	999
	Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.	999

PRINCE FORTINBRAS	Go, captain, from me greet the Danish king;	999
	Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras	999
	Craves the conveyance of a promised march	999
	Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.	999
	If that his majesty would aught with us,	999

HAMLET	Good sir, whose powers are these?	999
	999
Captain	They are of Norway, sir.	999
	999
HAMLET	How purposed, sir, I pray you?	999
	999
Captain	Against some part of Poland.	999
	999
HAMLET	Who commands them, sir?	999
	999
Captain	The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.	999
	999
HAMLET	Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,	999
	Or for some frontier?	999
	999
Captain	Truly to speak, and with no addition,	999
	We go to gain a little patch of ground	999
	That hath in it no profit but the name.	999
	To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;	999
	Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole	999
	A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.	999
	999
HAMLET	Why, then the Polack never will defend it.	999
	999
Captain	Yes, it is already garrison'd.	999
	999
HAMLET	Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats	999
	Will not debate the question of this straw:	999
	This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,	999
	That inward breaks, and shows no cause without	999
	Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.	999
	999
Captain	God be wi' you, sir.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ROSENCRANTZ	Wilt please you go, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	I'll be with you straight go a little before.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all except HAMLET]	999
	999
	How all occasions do inform against me,	999
	And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,	999
	If his chief good and market of his time	999
	Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.	999
	Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,	999
	Looking before and after, gave us not	999
	That capability and god-like reason	999
	To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be	999
	Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple	999
	Of thinking too precisely on the event,	999
	A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom	999
	And ever three parts coward, I do not know	999
	Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'	999
	Sith I have cause and will and strength and means	999
	To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:	999
	Witness this army of such mass and charge	999
	Led by a delicate and tender prince,	999
	Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd	999
	Makes mouths at the invisible event,	999
	Exposing what is mortal and unsure	999
	To all that fortune, death and danger dare,	999
	Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great	999
	Is not to stir without great argument,	999
	But greatly to find quarrel in a straw	999
	When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,	999
	That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,	999
	Excitements of my reason and my blood,	999
	And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see	999
	The imminent death of twenty thousand men,	999
	That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,	999
	Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot	999
	Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,	999
	Which is not tomb enough and continent	999
	To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,	999
	My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!	999

SCENE V	Elsinore. A room in the castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman]	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	I will not speak with her.	999
	999
Gentleman	She is importunate, indeed distract:	999
	Her mood will needs be pitied.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	What would she have?	999
	999
Gentleman	She speaks much of her father; says she hears	999
	There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;	999
	Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,	999
	That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,	999
	Yet the unshaped use of it doth move	999
	The hearers to collection; they aim at it,	999
	And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;	999
	Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures	999
	yield them,	999
	Indeed would make one think there might be thought,	999
	Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.	999
	999
HORATIO	'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew	999
	Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Let her come in.	999
	999
	[Exit HORATIO]	999
	999
	To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,	999
	Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:	999
	So full of artless jealousy is guilt,	999
	It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.	999
	999
	[Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA]	999
	999
OPHELIA	Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	How now, Ophelia!	999
	999
OPHELIA	[Sings]	999
	999
	How should I your true love know	999
	From another one?	999
	By his cockle hat and staff,	999
	And his sandal shoon.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?	999
	999
OPHELIA	Say you? nay, pray you, mark.	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	He is dead and gone, lady,	999
	He is dead and gone;	999
	At his head a grass-green turf,	999
	At his heels a stone.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Nay, but, Ophelia,--	999
	999
OPHELIA	Pray you, mark.	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	White his shroud as the mountain snow,--	999
	999
	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS]	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alas, look here, my lord.	999
	999
OPHELIA	[Sings]	999
	999
	Larded with sweet flowers	999
	Which bewept to the grave did go	999
	With true-love showers.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	How do you, pretty lady?	999
	999
OPHELIA	Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's	999
	daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not	999
	what we may be. God be at your table!	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Conceit upon her father.	999
	999
OPHELIA	Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they	999
	ask you what it means, say you this:	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,	999
	All in the morning betime,	999
	And I a maid at your window,	999
	To be your Valentine.	999
	Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,	999
	And dupp'd the chamber-door;	999
	Let in the maid, that out a maid	999
	Never departed more.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Pretty Ophelia!	999
	999
OPHELIA	Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	By Gis and by Saint Charity,	999
	Alack, and fie for shame!	999
	Young men will do't, if they come to't;	999
	By cock, they are to blame.	999
	Quoth she, before you tumbled me,	999
	You promised me to wed.	999
	So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,	999
	An thou hadst not come to my bed.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	How long hath she been thus?	999
	999
OPHELIA	I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I	999
	cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him	999
	i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:	999
	and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my	999
	coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;	999
	good night, good night.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Follow her close; give her good watch,	999
	I pray you.	999
	999
	[Exit HORATIO]	999
	999
	O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs	999
	All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,	999
	When sorrows come, they come not single spies	999
	But in battalions. First, her father slain:	999
	Next, your son gone; and he most violent author	999
	Of his own just remove: the people muddied,	999
	Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,	999
	For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,	999
	In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia	999
	Divided from herself and her fair judgment,	999
	Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:	999
	Last, and as much containing as all these,	999
	Her brother is in secret come from France;	999
	Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,	999
	And wants not buzzers to infect his ear	999
	With pestilent speeches of his father's death;	999
	Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,	999
	Will nothing stick our person to arraign	999
	In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,	999
	Like to a murdering-piece, in many places	999
	Gives me superfluous death.	999
	999
	[A noise within]	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alack, what noise is this?	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.	999
	999
	[Enter another Gentleman]	999
	999
	What is the matter?	999
	999
Gentleman	Save yourself, my lord:	999
	The ocean, overpeering of his list,	999
	Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste	999
	Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,	999
	O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;	999
	And, as the world were now but to begin,	999
	Antiquity forgot, custom not known,	999
	The ratifiers and props of every word,	999
	They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'	999
	Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:	999
	'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!	999
	O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	The doors are broke.	999
	999
	[Noise within]	999
	999
	[Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following]	999
	999
LAERTES	Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.	999
	999
Danes	No, let's come in.	999
	999
LAERTES	                  I pray you, give me leave.	999
	999
Danes	We will, we will.	999
	999
	[They retire without the door]	999
	999
LAERTES	I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,	999
	Give me my father!	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  Calmly, good Laertes.	999
	999
LAERTES	That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,	999
	Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot	999
	Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow	999
	Of my true mother.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	                  What is the cause, Laertes,	999
	That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?	999
	Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:	999
	There's such divinity doth hedge a king,	999
	That treason can but peep to what it would,	999
	Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,	999
	Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.	999
	Speak, man.	999
	999
LAERTES	Where is my father?	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Dead.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	But not by him.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Let him demand his fill.	999
	999
LAERTES	How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:	999
	To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!	999
	Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!	999
	I dare damnation. To this point I stand,	999
	That both the worlds I give to negligence,	999
	Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged	999
	Most thoroughly for my father.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Who shall stay you?	999
	999
LAERTES	My will, not all the world:	999
	And for my means, I'll husband them so well,	999
	They shall go far with little.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Good Laertes,	999
	If you desire to know the certainty	999
	Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,	999
	That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,	999
	Winner and loser?	999
	999
LAERTES	None but his enemies.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Will you know them then?	999
	999
LAERTES	To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;	999
	And like the kind life-rendering pelican,	999
	Repast them with my blood.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Why, now you speak	999
	Like a good child and a true gentleman.	999
	That I am guiltless of your father's death,	999
	And am most sensible in grief for it,	999
	It shall as level to your judgment pierce	999
	As day does to your eye.	999
	999
Danes	[Within]                Let her come in.	999
	999
LAERTES	How now! what noise is that?	999
	999
	[Re-enter OPHELIA]	999
	999
	O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,	999
	Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!	999
	By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,	999
	Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!	999
	Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!	999
	O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits	999
	Should be as moral as an old man's life?	999
	Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,	999
	It sends some precious instance of itself	999
	After the thing it loves.	999
	999
OPHELIA	[Sings]	999
	999
	They bore him barefaced on the bier;	999
	Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;	999
	And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--	999
	Fare you well, my dove!	999
	999
LAERTES	Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,	999
	It could not move thus.	999
	999
OPHELIA	[Sings]	999
	999
	You must sing a-down a-down,	999
	An you call him a-down-a.	999
	O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false	999
	steward, that stole his master's daughter.	999
	999
LAERTES	This nothing's more than matter.	999
	999
OPHELIA	There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,	999
	love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.	999
	999
LAERTES	A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.	999
	999
OPHELIA	There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue	999
	for you; and here's some for me: we may call it	999
	herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with	999
	a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you	999
	some violets, but they withered all when my father	999
	died: they say he made a good end,--	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.	999
	999
LAERTES	Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,	999
	She turns to favour and to prettiness.	999
	999
OPHELIA	[Sings]	999
	999
	And will he not come again?	999
	And will he not come again?	999
	No, no, he is dead:	999
	Go to thy death-bed:	999
	He never will come again.	999
	999
	His beard was as white as snow,	999
	All flaxen was his poll:	999
	He is gone, he is gone,	999
	And we cast away moan:	999
	God ha' mercy on his soul!	999
	999
	And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LAERTES	Do you see this, O God?	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Laertes, I must commune with your grief,	999
	Or you deny me right. Go but apart,	999
	Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.	999
	And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:	999
	If by direct or by collateral hand	999
	They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,	999
	Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,	999
	To you in satisfaction; but if not,	999
	Be you content to lend your patience to us,	999
	And we shall jointly labour with your soul	999
	To give it due content.	999
	999
LAERTES	Let this be so;	999
	His means of death, his obscure funeral--	999
	No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,	999
	No noble rite nor formal ostentation--	999
	Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,	999
	That I must call't in question.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	So you shall;	999
	And where the offence is let the great axe fall.	999

HORATIO	Let him bless thee too.	999

First Sailor	He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for	999
	you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was	999
	bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am	999
	let to know it is.	999
	999
HORATIO	[Reads]  'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked	999
	this, give these fellows some means to the king:	999
	they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old	999
	at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us	999
	chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on	999
	a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded	999
	them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so	999
	I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with	999
	me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they	999
	did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king	999
	have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me	999
	with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I	999
	have words to speak in thine ear will make thee	999
	dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of	999
	the matter. These good fellows will bring thee	999
	where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their	999
	course for England: of them I have much to tell	999
	thee. Farewell.	999
	'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'	999
	Come, I will make you way for these your letters;	999

SCENE VII	Another room in the castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,	999
	And you must put me in your heart for friend,	999
	Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,	999
	That he which hath your noble father slain	999
	Pursued my life.	999
	999
LAERTES	                  It well appears: but tell me	999
	Why you proceeded not against these feats,	999
	So crimeful and so capital in nature,	999
	As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,	999
	You mainly were stirr'd up.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	O, for two special reasons;	999
	Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,	999
	But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother	999
	Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--	999
	My virtue or my plague, be it either which--	999
	She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,	999
	That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,	999
	I could not but by her. The other motive,	999
	Why to a public count I might not go,	999
	Is the great love the general gender bear him;	999
	Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,	999
	Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,	999
	Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,	999
	Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,	999
	Would have reverted to my bow again,	999
	And not where I had aim'd them.	999
	999
LAERTES	And so have I a noble father lost;	999
	A sister driven into desperate terms,	999
	Whose worth, if praises may go back again,	999
	Stood challenger on mount of all the age	999
	For her perfections: but my revenge will come.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think	999
	That we are made of stuff so flat and dull	999
	That we can let our beard be shook with danger	999
	And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:	999
	I loved your father, and we love ourself;	999
	And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999

	999
KING CLAUDIUS	From Hamlet! who brought them?	999

Messenger	Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:	999
	They were given me by Claudio; he received them	999

	your kingly eyes: when I shall, first asking your	999
	pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden	999
	and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'	999
	What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?	999
	Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?	999
	999
LAERTES	Know you the hand?	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!	999
	And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'	999
	Can you advise me?	999
	999
LAERTES	I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;	999
	It warms the very sickness in my heart,	999
	That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,	999
	'Thus didest thou.'	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	If it be so, Laertes--	999
	As how should it be so? how otherwise?--	999
	Will you be ruled by me?	999
	999
LAERTES	Ay, my lord;	999
	So you will not o'errule me to a peace.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,	999
	As checking at his voyage, and that he means	999
	No more to undertake it, I will work him	999
	To an exploit, now ripe in my device,	999
	Under the which he shall not choose but fall:	999
	And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,	999
	But even his mother shall uncharge the practise	999
	And call it accident.	999
	999
LAERTES	My lord, I will be ruled;	999
	The rather, if you could devise it so	999
	That I might be the organ.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	It falls right.	999
	You have been talk'd of since your travel much,	999
	And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality	999
	Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts	999
	Did not together pluck such envy from him	999
	As did that one, and that, in my regard,	999
	Of the unworthiest siege.	999
	999
LAERTES	What part is that, my lord?	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	A very riband in the cap of youth,	999
	Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes	999
	The light and careless livery that it wears	999
	Than settled age his sables and his weeds,	999
	Importing health and graveness. Two months since,	999
	Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--	999
	I've seen myself, and served against, the French,	999
	And they can well on horseback: but this gallant	999
	Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;	999
	And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,	999
	As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured	999
	With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,	999
	That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,	999
	Come short of what he did.	999
	999
LAERTES	A Norman was't?	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	A Norman.	999
	999
LAERTES	Upon my life, Lamond.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	The very same.	999
	999
LAERTES	I know him well: he is the brooch indeed	999
	And gem of all the nation.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	He made confession of you,	999
	And gave you such a masterly report	999
	For art and exercise in your defence	999
	And for your rapier most especially,	999
	That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,	999
	If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,	999
	He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,	999
	If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his	999
	Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy	999
	That he could nothing do but wish and beg	999
	Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.	999
	Now, out of this,--	999
	999
LAERTES	What out of this, my lord?	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Laertes, was your father dear to you?	999
	Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,	999
	A face without a heart?	999
	999
LAERTES	Why ask you this?	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Not that I think you did not love your father;	999
	But that I know love is begun by time;	999
	And that I see, in passages of proof,	999
	Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.	999
	There lives within the very flame of love	999
	A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;	999
	And nothing is at a like goodness still;	999
	For goodness, growing to a plurisy,	999
	Dies in his own too much: that we would do	999
	We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes	999
	And hath abatements and delays as many	999
	As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;	999
	And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,	999
	That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--	999
	Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,	999
	To show yourself your father's son in deed	999
	More than in words?	999
	999
LAERTES	To cut his throat i' the church.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;	999
	Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,	999
	Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.	999
	Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:	999
	We'll put on those shall praise your excellence	999
	And set a double varnish on the fame	999
	The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together	999
	And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,	999
	Most generous and free from all contriving,	999
	Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,	999
	Or with a little shuffling, you may choose	999
	A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise	999
	Requite him for your father.	999
	999
LAERTES	I will do't:	999
	And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.	999
	I bought an unction of a mountebank,	999
	So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,	999
	Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,	999
	Collected from all simples that have virtue	999
	Under the moon, can save the thing from death	999
	That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point	999
	With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,	999
	It may be death.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	                  Let's further think of this;	999
	Weigh what convenience both of time and means	999
	May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,	999
	And that our drift look through our bad performance,	999
	'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project	999
	Should have a back or second, that might hold,	999
	If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:	999
	We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.	999
	When in your motion you are hot and dry--	999
	As make your bouts more violent to that end--	999
	And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him	999
	A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,	999
	If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,	999
	Our purpose may hold there.	999
	999
	[Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE]	999
	999
		      How now, sweet queen!	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	One woe doth tread upon another's heel,	999
	So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.	999
	999
LAERTES	Drown'd! O, where?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	There is a willow grows aslant a brook,	999
	That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;	999
	There with fantastic garlands did she come	999
	Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples	999
	That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,	999
	But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:	999
	There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds	999
	Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;	999
	When down her weedy trophies and herself	999
	Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;	999
	And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:	999
	Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;	999
	As one incapable of her own distress,	999
	Or like a creature native and indued	999
	Unto that element: but long it could not be	999
	Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,	999
	Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay	999
	To muddy death.	999
	999
LAERTES	                  Alas, then, she is drown'd?	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Drown'd, drown'd.	999
	999
LAERTES	Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,	999
	And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet	999
	It is our trick; nature her custom holds,	999
	Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,	999
	The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:	999
	I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,	999
	But that this folly douts it.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Let's follow, Gertrude:	999
	How much I had to do to calm his rage!	999
	Now fear I this will give it start again;	999
	Therefore let's follow.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

	HAMLET	999
	999
	999
ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A churchyard.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter two Clowns, with spades, &c]	999
	999
First Clown	Is she to be buried in Christian burial that	999
	wilfully seeks her own salvation?	999
	999
Second Clown	I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave	999
	straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it	999
	Christian burial.	999
	999
First Clown	How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her	999
	own defence?	999
	999
Second Clown	Why, 'tis found so.	999
	999
First Clown	It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For	999
	here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,	999
	it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it	999
	is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned	999
	herself wittingly.	999
	999
Second Clown	Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--	999
	999
First Clown	Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here	999
	stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,	999
	and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he	999
	goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him	999
	and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he	999
	that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.	999
	999
Second Clown	But is this law?	999
	999
First Clown	Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.	999
	999
Second Clown	Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been	999
	a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'	999
	Christian burial.	999
	999
First Clown	Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that	999
	great folk should have countenance in this world to	999
	drown or hang themselves, more than their even	999
	Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient	999
	gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:	999
	they hold up Adam's profession.	999
	999
Second Clown	Was he a gentleman?	999
	999
First Clown	He was the first that ever bore arms.	999
	999
Second Clown	Why, he had none.	999
	999
First Clown	What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the	999
	Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'	999
	could he dig without arms? I'll put another	999
	question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the	999
	purpose, confess thyself--	999
	999
Second Clown	Go to.	999
	999
First Clown	What is he that builds stronger than either the	999
	mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?	999
	999
Second Clown	The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a	999
	thousand tenants.	999
	999
First Clown	I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows	999
	does well; but how does it well? it does well to	999
	those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the	999
	gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,	999
	the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.	999
	999
Second Clown	'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or	999
	a carpenter?'	999
	999
First Clown	Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.	999
	999
Second Clown	Marry, now I can tell.	999
	999
First Clown	To't.	999
	999
Second Clown	Mass, I cannot tell.	999
	999
	[Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance]	999
	999
First Clown	Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull	999
	ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when	999
	you are asked this question next, say 'a	999
	grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till	999
	doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a	999
	stoup of liquor.	999
	999
	[Exit Second Clown]	999
	999
	[He digs and sings]	999
	999
	In youth, when I did love, did love,	999
	Methought it was very sweet,	999
	To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,	999
	O, methought, there was nothing meet.	999
	999
HAMLET	Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he	999
	sings at grave-making?	999
	999
HORATIO	Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.	999
	999
HAMLET	'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath	999
	the daintier sense.	999
	999
First Clown	[Sings]	999
	999
	But age, with his stealing steps,	999
	Hath claw'd me in his clutch,	999
	And hath shipped me intil the land,	999
	As if I had never been such.	999
	999
	[Throws up a skull]	999
	999
HAMLET	That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:	999
	how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were	999
	Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It	999
	might be the pate of a politician, which this ass	999
	now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,	999
	might it not?	999
	999
HORATIO	It might, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,	999
	sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might	999
	be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord	999
	such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?	999
	999
HORATIO	Ay, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and	999
	knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:	999
	here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to	999
	see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,	999
	but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.	999
	999
First Clown: [Sings]	999
	999
	A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,	999
	For and a shrouding sheet:	999
	O, a pit of clay for to be made	999
	For such a guest is meet.	999
	999
	[Throws up another skull]	999
	999
HAMLET	There's another: why may not that be the skull of a	999
	lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,	999
	his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he	999
	suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the	999
	sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of	999
	his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be	999
	in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,	999
	his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,	999
	his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and	999
	the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine	999
	pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him	999
	no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than	999
	the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The	999
	very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in	999
	this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?	999
	999
HORATIO	Not a jot more, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Is not parchment made of sheepskins?	999
	999
HORATIO	Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.	999
	999
HAMLET	They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance	999
	in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose	999
	grave's this, sirrah?	999
	999
First Clown	Mine, sir.	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	O, a pit of clay for to be made	999
	For such a guest is meet.	999
	999
HAMLET	I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.	999
	999
First Clown	You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not	999
	yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.	999
	999
HAMLET	'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:	999
	'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.	999
	999
First Clown	'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to	999
	you.	999
	999
HAMLET	What man dost thou dig it for?	999
	999
First Clown	For no man, sir.	999
	999
HAMLET	What woman, then?	999
	999
First Clown	For none, neither.	999
	999
HAMLET	Who is to be buried in't?	999
	999
First Clown	One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.	999
	999
HAMLET	How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the	999
	card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,	999
	Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of	999
	it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the	999
	peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he	999
	gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a	999
	grave-maker?	999
	999
First Clown	Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day	999
	that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.	999
	999
HAMLET	How long is that since?	999
	999
First Clown	Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it	999
	was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that	999
	is mad, and sent into England.	999
	999
HAMLET	Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?	999
	999
First Clown	Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits	999
	there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.	999
	999
HAMLET	Why?	999
	999
First Clown	'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men	999
	are as mad as he.	999
	999
HAMLET	How came he mad?	999
	999
First Clown	Very strangely, they say.	999
	999
HAMLET	How strangely?	999
	999
First Clown	Faith, e'en with losing his wits.	999
	999
HAMLET	Upon what ground?	999
	999
First Clown	Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man	999
	and boy, thirty years.	999
	999
HAMLET	How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?	999
	999
First Clown	I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we	999
	have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce	999
	hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year	999
	or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.	999
	999
HAMLET	Why he more than another?	999
	999
First Clown	Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that	999
	he will keep out water a great while; and your water	999
	is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.	999
	Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth	999
	three and twenty years.	999
	999
HAMLET	Whose was it?	999
	999
First Clown	A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?	999
	999
HAMLET	Nay, I know not.	999
	999
First Clown	A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a	999
	flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,	999
	sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.	999
	999
HAMLET	This?	999
	999
First Clown	E'en that.	999
	999
HAMLET	Let me see.	999
	999
	[Takes the skull]	999
	999
	Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow	999
	of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath	999
	borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how	999
	abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at	999
	it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know	999
	not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your	999
	gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,	999
	that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one	999
	now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?	999
	Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let	999
	her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must	999
	come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell	999
	me one thing.	999
	999
HORATIO	What's that, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'	999
	the earth?	999
	999
HORATIO	E'en so.	999
	999
HAMLET	And smelt so? pah!	999
	999
	[Puts down the skull]	999
	999
HORATIO	E'en so, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may	999
	not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,	999
	till he find it stopping a bung-hole?	999
	999
HORATIO	'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.	999
	999
HAMLET	No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with	999
	modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as	999
	thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,	999
	Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of	999
	earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he	999
	was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?	999
	Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,	999
	Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:	999
	O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,	999
	Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!	999
	But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.	999
	999
	[Enter Priest, &c. in procession; the Corpse of	999
	OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING	999
	CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, &c]	999
	999
	The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?	999
	And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken	999
	The corse they follow did with desperate hand	999
	Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.	999
	Couch we awhile, and mark.	999
	999
	[Retiring with HORATIO]	999
	999
LAERTES	What ceremony else?	999
	999
HAMLET	That is Laertes,	999
	A very noble youth: mark.	999
	999
LAERTES	What ceremony else?	999
	999
First Priest	Her obsequies have been as far enlarged	999
	As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;	999
	And, but that great command o'ersways the order,	999
	She should in ground unsanctified have lodged	999
	Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,	999
	Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;	999
	Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,	999
	Her maiden strewments and the bringing home	999
	Of bell and burial.	999
	999
LAERTES	Must there no more be done?	999
	999
First Priest	No more be done:	999
	We should profane the service of the dead	999
	To sing a requiem and such rest to her	999
	As to peace-parted souls.	999
	999
LAERTES	Lay her i' the earth:	999
	And from her fair and unpolluted flesh	999
	May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,	999
	A ministering angel shall my sister be,	999
	When thou liest howling.	999
	999
HAMLET	What, the fair Ophelia!	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Sweets to the sweet: farewell!	999
	999
	[Scattering flowers]	999
	999
	I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;	999
	I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,	999
	And not have strew'd thy grave.	999
	999
LAERTES	O, treble woe	999
	Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,	999
	Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense	999
	Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,	999
	Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:	999
	999
	[Leaps into the grave]	999
	999
	Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,	999
	Till of this flat a mountain you have made,	999
	To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head	999
	Of blue Olympus.	999
	999
HAMLET	[Advancing]     What is he whose grief	999
	Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow	999
	Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand	999
	Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,	999
	Hamlet the Dane.	999
	999
	[Leaps into the grave]	999
	999
LAERTES	                  The devil take thy soul!	999
	999
	[Grappling with him]	999
	999
HAMLET	Thou pray'st not well.	999
	I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;	999
	For, though I am not splenitive and rash,	999
	Yet have I something in me dangerous,	999
	Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Pluck them asunder.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Hamlet, Hamlet!	999
	999
All	Gentlemen,--	999
	999
HORATIO	                  Good my lord, be quiet.	999
	999
	[The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave]	999
	999
HAMLET	Why I will fight with him upon this theme	999
	Until my eyelids will no longer wag.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	O my son, what theme?	999
	999
HAMLET	I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers	999
	Could not, with all their quantity of love,	999
	Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	O, he is mad, Laertes.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	For love of God, forbear him.	999
	999
HAMLET	'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:	999
	Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?	999
	Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?	999
	I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?	999
	To outface me with leaping in her grave?	999
	Be buried quick with her, and so will I:	999
	And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw	999
	Millions of acres on us, till our ground,	999
	Singeing his pate against the burning zone,	999
	Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,	999
	I'll rant as well as thou.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	This is mere madness:	999
	And thus awhile the fit will work on him;	999
	Anon, as patient as the female dove,	999
	When that her golden couplets are disclosed,	999
	His silence will sit drooping.	999
	999
HAMLET	Hear you, sir;	999
	What is the reason that you use me thus?	999
	I loved you ever: but it is no matter;	999
	Let Hercules himself do what he may,	999
	The cat will mew and dog will have his day.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.	999
	999
	[Exit HORATIO]	999
	999
	[To LAERTES]	999
	999
	Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;	999
	We'll put the matter to the present push.	999
	Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.	999
	This grave shall have a living monument:	999
	An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;	999
	Till then, in patience our proceeding be.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

	HAMLET	999

	999
ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	A hall in the castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter HAMLET and HORATIO]	999
	999
HAMLET	So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;	999
	You do remember all the circumstance?	999
	999
HORATIO	Remember it, my lord?	999
	999
HAMLET	Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,	999
	That would not let me sleep: methought I lay	999
	Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,	999
	And praised be rashness for it, let us know,	999
	Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,	999
	When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us	999
	There's a divinity that shapes our ends,	999
	Rough-hew them how we will,--	999
	999
HORATIO	That is most certain.	999
	999
HAMLET	Up from my cabin,	999
	My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark	999
	Groped I to find out them; had my desire.	999
	Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew	999
	To mine own room again; making so bold,	999
	My fears forgetting manners, to unseal	999
	Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--	999
	O royal knavery!--an exact command,	999
	Larded with many several sorts of reasons	999
	Importing Denmark's health and England's too,	999
	With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,	999
	That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,	999
	No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,	999
	My head should be struck off.	999
	999
HORATIO	Is't possible?	999
	999
HAMLET	Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.	999
	But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?	999
	999
HORATIO	I beseech you.	999
	999
HAMLET	Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--	999
	Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,	999
	They had begun the play--I sat me down,	999
	Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:	999
	I once did hold it, as our statists do,	999
	A baseness to write fair and labour'd much	999
	How to forget that learning, but, sir, now	999
	It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know	999
	The effect of what I wrote?	999
	999
HORATIO	Ay, good my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	An earnest conjuration from the king,	999
	As England was his faithful tributary,	999
	As love between them like the palm might flourish,	999
	As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear	999
	And stand a comma 'tween their amities,	999
	And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,	999
	That, on the view and knowing of these contents,	999
	Without debatement further, more or less,	999
	He should the bearers put to sudden death,	999
	Not shriving-time allow'd.	999
	999
HORATIO	How was this seal'd?	999
	999
HAMLET	Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.	999
	I had my father's signet in my purse,	999
	Which was the model of that Danish seal;	999
	Folded the writ up in form of the other,	999
	Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,	999
	The changeling never known. Now, the next day	999
	Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent	999
	Thou know'st already.	999
	999
HORATIO	So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.	999
	999
HAMLET	Why, man, they did make love to this employment;	999
	They are not near my conscience; their defeat	999
	Does by their own insinuation grow:	999
	'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes	999
	Between the pass and fell incensed points	999
	Of mighty opposites.	999
	999
HORATIO	Why, what a king is this!	999
	999
HAMLET	Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--	999
	He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,	999
	Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,	999
	Thrown out his angle for my proper life,	999
	And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,	999
	To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,	999
	To let this canker of our nature come	999
	In further evil?	999
	999
HORATIO	It must be shortly known to him from England	999
	What is the issue of the business there.	999
	999
HAMLET	It will be short: the interim is mine;	999
	And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'	999
	But I am very sorry, good Horatio,	999
	That to Laertes I forgot myself;	999
	For, by the image of my cause, I see	999
	The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.	999
	But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me	999
	Into a towering passion.	999
	999
HORATIO	Peace! who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter OSRIC]	999
	999
OSRIC	Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.	999
	999
HAMLET	I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?	999
	999
HORATIO	No, my good lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to	999
	know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a	999
	beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at	999
	the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,	999
	spacious in the possession of dirt.	999
	999
OSRIC	Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I	999
	should impart a thing to you from his majesty.	999
	999
HAMLET	I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of	999
	spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.	999
	999
OSRIC	I thank your lordship, it is very hot.	999
	999
HAMLET	No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is	999
	northerly.	999
	999
OSRIC	It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.	999
	999
HAMLET	But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my	999
	complexion.	999
	999
OSRIC	Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as	999
	'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his	999
	majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a	999
	great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--	999
	999
HAMLET	I beseech you, remember--	999
	999
	[HAMLET moves him to put on his hat]	999
	999
OSRIC	Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.	999
	Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe	999
	me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent	999
	differences, of very soft society and great showing:	999
	indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or	999
	calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the	999
	continent of what part a gentleman would see.	999
	999
HAMLET	Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;	999
	though, I know, to divide him inventorially would	999
	dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw	999
	neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the	999
	verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of	999
	great article; and his infusion of such dearth and	999
	rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his	999
	semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace	999
	him, his umbrage, nothing more.	999
	999
OSRIC	Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.	999
	999
HAMLET	The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman	999
	in our more rawer breath?	999
	999
OSRIC	Sir?	999
	999
HORATIO	Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?	999
	You will do't, sir, really.	999
	999
HAMLET	What imports the nomination of this gentleman?	999
	999
OSRIC	Of Laertes?	999
	999
HORATIO	His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.	999
	999
HAMLET	Of him, sir.	999
	999
OSRIC	I know you are not ignorant--	999
	999
HAMLET	I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,	999
	it would not much approve me. Well, sir?	999
	999
OSRIC	You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--	999
	999
HAMLET	I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with	999
	him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to	999
	know himself.	999
	999
OSRIC	I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation	999
	laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.	999
	999
HAMLET	What's his weapon?	999
	999
OSRIC	Rapier and dagger.	999
	999
HAMLET	That's two of his weapons: but, well.	999
	999
OSRIC	The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary	999
	horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take	999
	it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their	999
	assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the	999
	carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very	999
	responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,	999
	and of very liberal conceit.	999
	999
HAMLET	What call you the carriages?	999
	999
HORATIO	I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.	999
	999
OSRIC	The carriages, sir, are the hangers.	999
	999
HAMLET	The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we	999
	could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might	999
	be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses	999
	against six French swords, their assigns, and three	999
	liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet	999
	against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?	999
	999
OSRIC	The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes	999
	between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you	999
	three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it	999
	would come to immediate trial, if your lordship	999
	would vouchsafe the answer.	999
	999
HAMLET	How if I answer 'no'?	999
	999
OSRIC	I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.	999
	999
HAMLET	Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his	999
	majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let	999
	the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the	999
	king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;	999
	if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.	999
	999
OSRIC	Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?	999
	999
HAMLET	To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.	999
	999
OSRIC	I commend my duty to your lordship.	999
	999
HAMLET	Yours, yours.	999
	999
	[Exit OSRIC]	999
	999
	He does well to commend it himself; there are no	999
	tongues else for's turn.	999
	999
HORATIO	This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.	999
	999
HAMLET	He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.	999
	Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I	999
	know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of	999
	the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of	999
	yesty collection, which carries them through and	999
	through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do	999
	but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.	999
	999
	[Enter a Lord]	999
	999
Lord	My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young	999
	Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in	999
	the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to	999
	play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.	999
	999
HAMLET	I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's	999
	pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now	999
	or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.	999
	999
Lord	The king and queen and all are coming down.	999
	999
HAMLET	In happy time.	999
	999
Lord	The queen desires you to use some gentle	999
	entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.	999
	999
HAMLET	She well instructs me.	999
	999
	[Exit Lord]	999
	999
HORATIO	You will lose this wager, my lord.	999
	999
HAMLET	I do not think so: since he went into France, I	999
	have been in continual practise: I shall win at the	999
	odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here	999
	about my heart: but it is no matter.	999
	999
HORATIO	Nay, good my lord,--	999
	999
HAMLET	It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of	999
	gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.	999
	999
HORATIO	If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will	999
	forestall their repair hither, and say you are not	999
	fit.	999
	999
HAMLET	Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special	999
	providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,	999
	'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be	999
	now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the	999
	readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he	999
	leaves, what is't to leave betimes?	999
	999
	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES,	999
	Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, &c]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.	999
	999
	[KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's]	999
	999
HAMLET	Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;	999
	But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.	999
	This presence knows,	999
	And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd	999
	With sore distraction. What I have done,	999
	That might your nature, honour and exception	999
	Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.	999
	Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:	999
	If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,	999
	And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,	999
	Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.	999
	Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,	999
	Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;	999
	His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.	999
	Sir, in this audience,	999
	Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil	999
	Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,	999
	That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,	999
	And hurt my brother.	999
	999
LAERTES	I am satisfied in nature,	999
	Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most	999
	To my revenge: but in my terms of honour	999
	I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,	999
	Till by some elder masters, of known honour,	999
	I have a voice and precedent of peace,	999
	To keep my name ungored. But till that time,	999
	I do receive your offer'd love like love,	999
	And will not wrong it.	999
	999
HAMLET	I embrace it freely;	999
	And will this brother's wager frankly play.	999
	Give us the foils. Come on.	999
	999
LAERTES	Come, one for me.	999
	999
HAMLET	I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance	999
	Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,	999
	Stick fiery off indeed.	999
	999
LAERTES	You mock me, sir.	999
	999
HAMLET	No, by this hand.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,	999
	You know the wager?	999
	999
HAMLET	Very well, my lord	999
	Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	I do not fear it; I have seen you both:	999
	But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.	999
	999
LAERTES	This is too heavy, let me see another.	999
	999
HAMLET	This likes me well. These foils have all a length?	999
	999
	[They prepare to play]	999
	999
OSRIC	Ay, my good lord.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.	999
	If Hamlet give the first or second hit,	999
	Or quit in answer of the third exchange,	999
	Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:	999
	The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;	999
	And in the cup an union shall he throw,	999
	Richer than that which four successive kings	999
	In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;	999
	And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,	999
	The trumpet to the cannoneer without,	999
	The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,	999
	'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:	999
	And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.	999
	999
HAMLET	Come on, sir.	999
	999
LAERTES	                  Come, my lord.	999
	999
	[They play]	999
	999
HAMLET	One.	999
	999
LAERTES	No.	999
	999
HAMLET	Judgment.	999
	999
OSRIC	A hit, a very palpable hit.	999
	999
LAERTES	Well; again.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;	999
	Here's to thy health.	999
	999
	[Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within]	999
	999
		Give him the cup.	999
	999
HAMLET	I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.	999
	999
	[They play]	999
	999
	Another hit; what say you?	999
	999
LAERTES	A touch, a touch, I do confess.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Our son shall win.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  He's fat, and scant of breath.	999
	Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;	999
	The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.	999
	999
HAMLET	Good madam!	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	          Gertrude, do not drink.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	[Aside]  It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.	999
	999
HAMLET	I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	Come, let me wipe thy face.	999
	999
LAERTES	My lord, I'll hit him now.	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	I do not think't.	999
	999
LAERTES	[Aside]  And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.	999
	999
HAMLET	Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;	999
	I pray you, pass with your best violence;	999
	I am afeard you make a wanton of me.	999
	999
LAERTES	Say you so? come on.	999
	999
	[They play]	999
	999
OSRIC	Nothing, neither way.	999
	999
LAERTES	Have at you now!	999
	999
	[LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they	999
	change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES]	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	Part them; they are incensed.	999
	999
HAMLET	Nay, come, again.	999
	999
	[QUEEN GERTRUDE falls]	999
	999
OSRIC	                  Look to the queen there, ho!	999
	999
HORATIO	They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?	999
	999
OSRIC	How is't, Laertes?	999
	999
LAERTES	Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;	999
	I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.	999
	999
HAMLET	How does the queen?	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	She swounds to see them bleed.	999
	999
QUEEN GERTRUDE	No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--	999
	The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
HAMLET	O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:	999
	Treachery! Seek it out.	999
	999
LAERTES	It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;	999
	No medicine in the world can do thee good;	999
	In thee there is not half an hour of life;	999
	The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,	999
	Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise	999
	Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,	999
	Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:	999
	I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.	999
	999
HAMLET	The point!--envenom'd too!	999
	Then, venom, to thy work.	999
	999
	[Stabs KING CLAUDIUS]	999
	999
All	Treason! treason!	999
	999
KING CLAUDIUS	O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.	999
	999
HAMLET	Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,	999
	Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?	999
	Follow my mother.	999
	999
	[KING CLAUDIUS dies]	999
	999
LAERTES	                  He is justly served;	999
	It is a poison temper'd by himself.	999
	Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:	999
	Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,	999
	Nor thine on me.	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
HAMLET	Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.	999
	I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!	999
	You that look pale and tremble at this chance,	999
	That are but mutes or audience to this act,	999
	Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,	999
	Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--	999
	But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;	999
	Thou livest; report me and my cause aright	999
	To the unsatisfied.	999
	999
HORATIO	Never believe it:	999
	I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:	999
	Here's yet some liquor left.	999
	999
HAMLET	As thou'rt a man,	999
	Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.	999
	O good Horatio, what a wounded name,	999
	Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!	999
	If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart	999
	Absent thee from felicity awhile,	999
	And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,	999
	To tell my story.	999
	999
	[March afar off, and shot within]	999
	999
	What warlike noise is this?	999
	999
OSRIC	Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,	999
	To the ambassadors of England gives	999
	This warlike volley.	999
	999
HAMLET	O, I die, Horatio;	999
	The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:	999
	I cannot live to hear the news from England;	999
	But I do prophesy the election lights	999
	On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;	999
	So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,	999
	Which have solicited. The rest is silence.	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
HORATIO	Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:	999
	And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!	999
	Why does the drum come hither?	999
	999
	[March within]	999
	999
	[Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors,	999
	and others]	999
	999
PRINCE FORTINBRAS	Where is this sight?	999
	999
HORATIO	What is it ye would see?	999
	If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.	999
	999
PRINCE FORTINBRAS	This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,	999
	What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,	999
	That thou so many princes at a shot	999
	So bloodily hast struck?	999
	999
First Ambassador	The sight is dismal;	999
	And our affairs from England come too late:	999
	The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,	999
	To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,	999
	That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:	999
	Where should we have our thanks?	999
	999
HORATIO	Not from his mouth,	999
	Had it the ability of life to thank you:	999
	He never gave commandment for their death.	999
	But since, so jump upon this bloody question,	999
	You from the Polack wars, and you from England,	999
	Are here arrived give order that these bodies	999
	High on a stage be placed to the view;	999
	And let me speak to the yet unknowing world	999
	How these things came about: so shall you hear	999
	Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,	999
	Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,	999
	Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,	999
	And, in this upshot, purposes mistook	999
	Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I	999
	Truly deliver.	999
	999
PRINCE FORTINBRAS	                  Let us haste to hear it,	999
	And call the noblest to the audience.	999
	For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:	999
	I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,	999
	Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.	999
	999
HORATIO	Of that I shall have also cause to speak,	999
	And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;	999
	But let this same be presently perform'd,	999
	Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance	999
	On plots and errors, happen.	999
	999
PRINCE FORTINBRAS	Let four captains	999
	Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;	999
	For he was likely, had he been put on,	999
	To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,	999
	The soldiers' music and the rites of war	999
	Speak loudly for him.	999
	Take up the bodies: such a sight as this	999
	Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.	999
	Go, bid the soldiers shoot.	999
	999
	[A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead	999
	bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off]	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Rome. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners]	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:	999
	Is this a holiday? what! know you not,	999
	Being mechanical, you ought not walk	999
	Upon a labouring day without the sign	999
	Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?	999
	999
First Commoner	Why, sir, a carpenter.	999
	999
MARULLUS	Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?	999
	What dost thou with thy best apparel on?	999
	You, sir, what trade are you?	999
	999
Second Commoner	Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,	999
	as you would say, a cobbler.	999
	999
MARULLUS	But what trade art thou? answer me directly.	999
	999
Second Commoner	A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe	999
	conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.	999
	999
MARULLUS	What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?	999
	999
Second Commoner	Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,	999
	if you be out, sir, I can mend you.	999
	999
MARULLUS	What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!	999
	999
Second Commoner	Why, sir, cobble you.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Thou art a cobbler, art thou?	999
	999
Second Commoner	Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I	999
	meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's	999
	matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon	999
	to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I	999
	recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon	999
	neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	But wherefore art not in thy shop today?	999
	Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?	999
	999
Second Commoner	Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself	999
	into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,	999
	to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.	999
	999
MARULLUS	Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?	999
	What tributaries follow him to Rome,	999
	To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?	999
	You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!	999
	O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,	999
	Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft	999
	Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,	999
	To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,	999
	Your infants in your arms, and there have sat	999
	The livelong day, with patient expectation,	999
	To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:	999
	And when you saw his chariot but appear,	999
	Have you not made an universal shout,	999
	That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,	999
	To hear the replication of your sounds	999
	Made in her concave shores?	999
	And do you now put on your best attire?	999
	And do you now cull out a holiday?	999
	And do you now strew flowers in his way	999
	That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!	999
	Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,	999
	Pray to the gods to intermit the plague	999
	That needs must light on this ingratitude.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,	999
	Assemble all the poor men of your sort;	999
	Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears	999
	Into the channel, till the lowest stream	999
	Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all the Commoners]	999
	999
	See whether their basest metal be not moved;	999
	They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.	999
	Go you down that way towards the Capitol;	999
	This way will I	disrobe the images,	999
	If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.	999
	999
MARULLUS	May we do so?	999
	You know it is the feast of Lupercal.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	It is no matter; let no images	999
	Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,	999
	And drive away the vulgar from the streets:	999
	So do you too, where you perceive them thick.	999
	These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing	999
	Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,	999
	Who else would soar above the view of men	999
	And keep us all in servile fearfulness.	999

	[Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;	999
	CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,	999
	CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among	999

	999
CASCA	         Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.	999
	999
CAESAR	Calpurnia!	999
	999
CALPURNIA	Here, my lord.	999
	999
CAESAR	Stand you directly in Antonius' way,	999
	When he doth run his course. Antonius!	999
	999
ANTONY	Caesar, my lord?	999
	999
CAESAR	Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,	999
	To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,	999
	The barren, touched in this holy chase,	999
	Shake off their sterile curse.	999
	999
ANTONY	I shall remember:	999
	When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.	999
	999
CAESAR	Set on; and leave no ceremony out.	999
	999
	[Flourish]	999
	999
Soothsayer	Caesar!	999
	999
CAESAR	Ha! who calls?	999
	999
CASCA	Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!	999
	999
CAESAR	Who is it in the press that calls on me?	999
	I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,	999
	Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.	999
	999
Soothsayer	Beware the ides of March.	999
	999
CAESAR	What man is that?	999
	999
BRUTUS	A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.	999
	999
CAESAR	Set him before me; let me see his face.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.	999
	999
CAESAR	What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.	999
	999
Soothsayer	Beware the ides of March.	999
	999
CAESAR	He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.	999
	999
	[Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS]	999
	999
CASSIUS	Will you go see the order of the course?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Not I.	999
	999
CASSIUS	I pray you, do.	999
	999
BRUTUS	I am not gamesome: I do lack some part	999
	Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.	999
	Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;	999
	I'll leave you.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Brutus, I do observe you now of late:	999
	I have not from your eyes that gentleness	999
	And show of love as I was wont to have:	999
	You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand	999
	Over your friend that loves you.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Cassius,	999
	Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,	999
	I turn the trouble of my countenance	999
	Merely upon myself. Vexed I am	999
	Of late with passions of some difference,	999
	Conceptions only proper to myself,	999
	Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;	999
	But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--	999
	Among which number, Cassius, be you one--	999
	Nor construe any further my neglect,	999
	Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,	999
	Forgets the shows of love to other men.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;	999
	By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried	999
	Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.	999
	Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?	999
	999
BRUTUS	No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,	999
	But by reflection, by some other things.	999
	999
CASSIUS	'Tis just:	999
	And it is very much lamented, Brutus,	999
	That you have no such mirrors as will turn	999
	Your hidden worthiness into your eye,	999
	That you might see your shadow. I have heard,	999
	Where many of the best respect in Rome,	999
	Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus	999
	And groaning underneath this age's yoke,	999
	Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,	999
	That you would have me seek into myself	999
	For that which is not in me?	999
	999
CASSIUS	Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:	999
	And since you know you cannot see yourself	999
	So well as by reflection, I, your glass,	999
	Will modestly discover to yourself	999
	That of yourself which you yet know not of.	999
	And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:	999
	Were I a common laugher, or did use	999
	To stale with ordinary oaths my love	999
	To every new protester; if you know	999
	That I do fawn on men and hug them hard	999
	And after scandal them, or if you know	999
	That I profess myself in banqueting	999
	To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.	999
	999
	[Flourish, and shout]	999
	999
BRUTUS	What means this shouting? I do fear, the people	999
	Choose Caesar for their king.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Ay, do you fear it?	999
	Then must I think you would not have it so.	999
	999
BRUTUS	I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.	999
	But wherefore do you hold me here so long?	999
	What is it that you would impart to me?	999
	If it be aught toward the general good,	999
	Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,	999
	And I will look on both indifferently,	999
	For let the gods so speed me as I love	999
	The name of honour more than I fear death.	999
	999
CASSIUS	I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,	999
	As well as I do know your outward favour.	999
	Well, honour is the subject of my story.	999
	I cannot tell what you and other men	999
	Think of this life; but, for my single self,	999
	I had as lief not be as live to be	999
	In awe of such a thing as I myself.	999
	I was born free as Caesar; so were you:	999
	We both have fed as well, and we can both	999
	Endure the winter's cold as well as he:	999
	For once, upon a raw and gusty day,	999
	The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,	999
	Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now	999
	Leap in with me into this angry flood,	999
	And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,	999
	Accoutred as I was, I plunged in	999
	And bade him follow; so indeed he did.	999
	The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it	999
	With lusty sinews, throwing it aside	999
	And stemming it with hearts of controversy;	999
	But ere we could arrive the point proposed,	999
	Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'	999
	I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,	999
	Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder	999
	The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber	999
	Did I the tired Caesar. And this man	999
	Is now become a god, and Cassius is	999
	A wretched creature and must bend his body,	999
	If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.	999
	He had a fever when he was in Spain,	999
	And when the fit was on him, I did mark	999
	How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;	999
	His coward lips did from their colour fly,	999
	And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world	999
	Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:	999
	Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans	999
	Mark him and write his speeches in their books,	999
	Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'	999
	As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me	999
	A man of such a feeble temper should	999
	So get the start of the majestic world	999
	And bear the palm alone.	999
	999
	[Shout. Flourish]	999
	999
BRUTUS	Another general shout!	999
	I do believe that these applauses are	999
	For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world	999
	Like a Colossus, and we petty men	999
	Walk under his huge legs and peep about	999
	To find ourselves dishonourable graves.	999
	Men at some time are masters of their fates:	999
	The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,	999
	But in ourselves, that we are underlings.	999
	Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?	999
	Why should that name be sounded more than yours?	999
	Write them together, yours is as fair a name;	999
	Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;	999
	Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,	999
	Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.	999
	Now, in the names of all the gods at once,	999
	Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,	999
	That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!	999
	Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!	999
	When went there by an age, since the great flood,	999
	But it was famed with more than with one man?	999
	When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,	999
	That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?	999
	Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,	999
	When there is in it but one only man.	999
	O, you and I have heard our fathers say,	999
	There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd	999
	The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome	999
	As easily as a king.	999
	999
BRUTUS	That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;	999
	What you would work me to, I have some aim:	999
	How I have thought of this and of these times,	999
	I shall recount hereafter; for this present,	999
	I would not, so with love I might entreat you,	999
	Be any further moved. What you have said	999
	I will consider; what you have to say	999
	I will with patience hear, and find a time	999
	Both meet to hear and answer such high things.	999
	Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:	999
	Brutus had rather be a villager	999
	Than to repute himself a son of Rome	999
	Under these hard conditions as this time	999
	Is like to lay upon us.	999
	999
CASSIUS	I am glad that my weak words	999
	Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.	999
	999
BRUTUS	The games are done and Caesar is returning.	999
	999
CASSIUS	As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;	999
	And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you	999
	What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.	999
	999
	[Re-enter CAESAR and his Train]	999
	999
BRUTUS	I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,	999
	The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,	999
	And all the rest look like a chidden train:	999
	Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero	999
	Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes	999
	As we have seen him in the Capitol,	999
	Being cross'd in conference by some senators.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Casca will tell us what the matter is.	999
	999
CAESAR	Antonius!	999
	999
ANTONY	Caesar?	999
	999
CAESAR	Let me have men about me that are fat;	999
	Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:	999
	Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;	999
	He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.	999
	999
ANTONY	Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;	999
	He is a noble Roman and well given.	999
	999
CAESAR	Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:	999
	Yet if my name were liable to fear,	999
	I do not know the man I should avoid	999
	So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;	999
	He is a great observer and he looks	999
	Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,	999
	As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;	999
	Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort	999
	As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit	999
	That could be moved to smile at any thing.	999
	Such men as he be never at heart's ease	999
	Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,	999
	And therefore are they very dangerous.	999
	I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd	999
	Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.	999
	Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,	999
	And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.	999
	999
	[Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA]	999
	999
CASCA	You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,	999
	That Caesar looks so sad.	999
	999
CASCA	Why, you were with him, were you not?	999
	999
BRUTUS	I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.	999
	999
CASCA	Why, there was a crown offered him: and being	999
	offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,	999
	thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.	999
	999
BRUTUS	What was the second noise for?	999
	999
CASCA	Why, for that too.	999
	999
CASSIUS	They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?	999
	999
CASCA	Why, for that too.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Was the crown offered him thrice?	999
	999
CASCA	Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every	999
	time gentler than other, and at every putting-by	999
	mine honest neighbours shouted.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Who offered him the crown?	999
	999
CASCA	Why, Antony.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.	999
	999
CASCA	I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:	999
	it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark	999
	Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown	999
	neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told	999
	you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my	999
	thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he	999
	offered it to him again; then he put it by again:	999
	but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his	999
	fingers off it. And then he offered it the third	999
	time; he put it the third time by: and still as he	999
	refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their	999
	chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps	999
	and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because	999
	Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked	999
	Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and	999
	for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of	999
	opening my lips and receiving the bad air.	999
	999
CASSIUS	But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?	999
	999
CASCA	He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at	999
	mouth, and was speechless.	999
	999
BRUTUS	'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.	999
	999
CASSIUS	No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,	999
	And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.	999
	999
CASCA	I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,	999
	Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not	999
	clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and	999
	displeased them, as they use to do the players in	999
	the theatre, I am no true man.	999
	999
BRUTUS	What said he when he came unto himself?	999
	999
CASCA	Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the	999
	common herd was glad he refused the crown, he	999
	plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his	999
	throat to cut. An I had been a man of any	999
	occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,	999
	I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so	999
	he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,	999
	If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired	999
	their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three	999
	or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good	999
	soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but	999
	there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had	999
	stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.	999
	999
BRUTUS	And after that, he came, thus sad, away?	999
	999
CASCA	Ay.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Did Cicero say any thing?	999
	999
CASCA	Ay, he spoke Greek.	999
	999
CASSIUS	To what effect?	999
	999
CASCA	Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the	999
	face again: but those that understood him smiled at	999
	one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own	999
	part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more	999
	news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs	999
	off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you	999
	well. There was more foolery yet, if I could	999
	remember it.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?	999
	999
CASCA	No, I am promised forth.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Will you dine with me to-morrow?	999
	999
CASCA	Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner	999
	worth the eating.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Good: I will expect you.	999
	999
CASCA	Do so. Farewell, both.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BRUTUS	What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!	999
	He was quick mettle when he went to school.	999
	999
CASSIUS	So is he now in execution	999
	Of any bold or noble enterprise,	999
	However he puts on this tardy form.	999
	This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,	999
	Which gives men stomach to digest his words	999
	With better appetite.	999
	999
BRUTUS	And so it is. For this time I will leave you:	999
	To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,	999
	I will come home to you; or, if you will,	999
	Come home to me, and I will wait for you.	999
	999
CASSIUS	I will do so: till then, think of the world.	999
	999
	[Exit BRUTUS]	999
	999
	Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,	999
	Thy honourable metal may be wrought	999
	From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet	999
	That noble minds keep ever with their likes;	999
	For who so firm that cannot be seduced?	999
	Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:	999
	If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,	999
	He should not humour me. I will this night,	999
	In several hands, in at his windows throw,	999
	As if they came from several citizens,	999
	Writings all tending to the great opinion	999
	That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely	999
	Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:	999
	And after this let Caesar seat him sure;	999
	For we will shake him, or worse days endure.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999

	JULIUS CAESAR	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	The same. A street.	999
	999
	999
	999
	999
	[Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides,	999
	CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO]	999
	999
CICERO	Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?	999
	Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?	999
	999
CASCA	Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth	999
	Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,	999
	I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds	999
	Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen	999
	The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,	999
	To be exalted with the threatening clouds:	999
	But never till to-night, never till now,	999
	Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.	999
	Either there is a civil strife in heaven,	999
	Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,	999
	Incenses them to send destruction.	999
	999
CICERO	Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?	999
	999
CASCA	A common slave--you know him well by sight--	999
	Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn	999
	Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,	999
	Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.	999
	Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--	999
	Against the Capitol I met a lion,	999
	Who glared upon me, and went surly by,	999
	Without annoying me: and there were drawn	999
	Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,	999
	Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw	999
	Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.	999
	And yesterday the bird of night did sit	999
	Even at noon-day upon the market-place,	999
	Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies	999
	Do so conjointly meet, let not men say	999
	'These are their reasons; they are natural;'	999
	For, I believe, they are portentous things	999
	Unto the climate that they point upon.	999
	999
CICERO	Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:	999
	But men may construe things after their fashion,	999
	Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.	999
	Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?	999
	999
CASCA	He doth; for he did bid Antonius	999
	Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.	999
	999
CICERO	Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky	999
	Is not to walk in.	999
	999
CASCA	Farewell, Cicero.	999
	999
	[Exit CICERO]	999
	999
	[Enter CASSIUS]	999
	999
CASSIUS	Who's there?	999
	999
CASCA	                  A Roman.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Casca, by your voice.	999
	999
CASCA	Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!	999
	999
CASSIUS	A very pleasing night to honest men.	999
	999
CASCA	Who ever knew the heavens menace so?	999
	999
CASSIUS	Those that have known the earth so full of faults.	999
	For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,	999
	Submitting me unto the perilous night,	999
	And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,	999
	Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;	999
	And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open	999
	The breast of heaven, I did present myself	999
	Even in the aim and very flash of it.	999
	999
CASCA	But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?	999
	It is the part of men to fear and tremble,	999
	When the most mighty gods by tokens send	999
	Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.	999
	999
CASSIUS	You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life	999
	That should be in a Roman you do want,	999
	Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze	999
	And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,	999
	To see the strange impatience of the heavens:	999
	But if you would consider the true cause	999
	Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,	999
	Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,	999
	Why old men fool and children calculate,	999
	Why all these things change from their ordinance	999
	Their natures and preformed faculties	999
	To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find	999
	That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,	999
	To make them instruments of fear and warning	999
	Unto some monstrous state.	999
	Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man	999
	Most like this dreadful night,	999
	That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars	999
	As doth the lion in the Capitol,	999
	A man no mightier than thyself or me	999
	In personal action, yet prodigious grown	999
	And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.	999
	999
CASCA	'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?	999
	999
CASSIUS	Let it be who it is: for Romans now	999
	Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;	999
	But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,	999
	And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;	999
	Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.	999
	999
CASCA	Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow	999
	Mean to establish Caesar as a king;	999
	And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,	999
	In every place, save here in Italy.	999
	999
CASSIUS	I know where I will wear this dagger then;	999
	Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:	999
	Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;	999
	Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:	999
	Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,	999
	Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,	999
	Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;	999
	But life, being weary of these worldly bars,	999
	Never lacks power to dismiss itself.	999
	If I know this, know all the world besides,	999
	That part of tyranny that I do bear	999
	I can shake off at pleasure.	999
	999
	[Thunder still]	999
	999
CASCA	So can I:	999
	So every bondman in his own hand bears	999
	The power to cancel his captivity.	999
	999
CASSIUS	And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?	999
	Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,	999
	But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:	999
	He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.	999
	Those that with haste will make a mighty fire	999
	Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,	999
	What rubbish and what offal, when it serves	999
	For the base matter to illuminate	999
	So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,	999
	Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this	999
	Before a willing bondman; then I know	999
	My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,	999
	And dangers are to me indifferent.	999
	999
CASCA	You speak to Casca, and to such a man	999
	That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:	999
	Be factious for redress of all these griefs,	999
	And I will set this foot of mine as far	999
	As who goes farthest.	999
	999
CASSIUS	There's a bargain made.	999
	Now know you, Casca, I have moved already	999
	Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans	999
	To undergo with me an enterprise	999
	Of honourable-dangerous consequence;	999
	And I do know, by this, they stay for me	999
	In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,	999
	There is no stir or walking in the streets;	999
	And the complexion of the element	999
	In favour's like the work we have in hand,	999
	Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.	999
	999
CASCA	Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.	999
	999
CASSIUS	'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;	999
	He is a friend.	999
	999
	[Enter CINNA]	999
	999
	Cinna, where haste you so?	999
	999
CINNA	To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?	999
	999
CASSIUS	No, it is Casca; one incorporate	999
	To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?	999
	999
CINNA	I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!	999
	There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Am I not stay'd for? tell me.	999
	999
CINNA	Yes, you are.	999
	O Cassius, if you could	999
	But win the noble Brutus to our party--	999
	999
CASSIUS	Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,	999
	And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,	999
	Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this	999
	In at his window; set this up with wax	999
	Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,	999
	Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.	999
	Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?	999
	999
CINNA	All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone	999
	To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,	999
	And so bestow these papers as you bade me.	999
	999
CASSIUS	That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.	999
	999
	[Exit CINNA]	999
	999
	Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day	999
	See Brutus at his house: three parts of him	999
	Is ours already, and the man entire	999
	Upon the next encounter yields him ours.	999
	999
CASCA	O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:	999
	And that which would appear offence in us,	999
	His countenance, like richest alchemy,	999
	Will change to virtue and to worthiness.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Him and his worth and our great need of him	999
	You have right well conceited. Let us go,	999
	For it is after midnight; and ere day	999
	We will awake him and be sure of him.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter BRUTUS]	999
	999
BRUTUS	What, Lucius, ho!	999
	I cannot, by the progress of the stars,	999
	Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!	999
	I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.	999
	When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!	999
	999
	[Enter LUCIUS]	999
	999
LUCIUS	Call'd you, my lord?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:	999
	When it is lighted, come and call me here.	999
	999
LUCIUS	I will, my lord.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BRUTUS	It must be by his death: and for my part,	999
	I know no personal cause to spurn at him,	999
	But for the general. He would be crown'd:	999
	How that might change his nature, there's the question.	999
	It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;	999
	And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--	999
	And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,	999
	That at his will he may do danger with.	999
	The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins	999
	Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,	999
	I have not known when his affections sway'd	999
	More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,	999
	That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,	999
	Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;	999
	But when he once attains the upmost round.	999
	He then unto the ladder turns his back,	999
	Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees	999
	By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.	999
	Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel	999
	Will bear no colour for the thing he is,	999
	Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,	999
	Would run to these and these extremities:	999
	And therefore think him as a serpent's egg	999
	Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,	999
	And kill him in the shell.	999
	999
	[Re-enter LUCIUS]	999
	999
LUCIUS	The taper burneth in your closet, sir.	999
	Searching the window for a flint, I found	999
	This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,	999
	It did not lie there when I went to bed.	999
	999
	[Gives him the letter]	999
	999
BRUTUS	Get you to bed again; it is not day.	999
	Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?	999
	999
LUCIUS	I know not, sir.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Look in the calendar, and bring me word.	999
	999
LUCIUS	I will, sir.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BRUTUS	The exhalations whizzing in the air	999
	Give so much light that I may read by them.	999
	999
	[Opens the letter and reads]	999
	999
	'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.	999
	Shall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress!	999
	Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'	999
	Such instigations have been often dropp'd	999
	Where I have took them up.	999
	'Shall Rome, &c.' Thus must I piece it out:	999
	Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?	999
	My ancestors did from the streets of Rome	999
	The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.	999
	'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated	999
	To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:	999
	If the redress will follow, thou receivest	999
	Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!	999
	999
	[Re-enter LUCIUS]	999
	999
LUCIUS	Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	999
BRUTUS	'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.	999
	999
	[Exit LUCIUS]	999
	999
	Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,	999
	I have not slept.	999
	Between the acting of a dreadful thing	999
	And the first motion, all the interim is	999
	Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:	999
	The Genius and the mortal instruments	999
	Are then in council; and the state of man,	999
	Like to a little kingdom, suffers then	999
	The nature of an insurrection.	999
	999
	[Re-enter LUCIUS]	999
	999
LUCIUS	Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,	999
	Who doth desire to see you.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Is he alone?	999
	999
LUCIUS	No, sir, there are moe with him.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Do you know them?	999
	999
LUCIUS	No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,	999
	And half their faces buried in their cloaks,	999
	That by no means I may discover them	999
	By any mark of favour.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Let 'em enter.	999
	999
	[Exit LUCIUS]	999
	999
	They are the faction. O conspiracy,	999
	Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,	999
	When evils are most free? O, then by day	999
	Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough	999
	To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;	999
	Hide it in smiles and affability:	999
	For if thou path, thy native semblance on,	999
	Not Erebus itself were dim enough	999
	To hide thee from prevention.	999
	999
	[Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS	999
	BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS]	999
	999
CASSIUS	I think we are too bold upon your rest:	999
	Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?	999
	999
BRUTUS	I have been up this hour, awake all night.	999
	Know I these men that come along with you?	999
	999
CASSIUS	Yes, every man of them, and no man here	999
	But honours you; and every one doth wish	999
	You had but that opinion of yourself	999
	Which every noble Roman bears of you.	999
	This is Trebonius.	999
	999
BRUTUS	                  He is welcome hither.	999
	999
CASSIUS	This, Decius Brutus.	999
	999
BRUTUS	He is welcome too.	999
	999
CASSIUS	This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.	999
	999
BRUTUS	They are all welcome.	999
	What watchful cares do interpose themselves	999
	Betwixt your eyes and night?	999
	999
CASSIUS	Shall I entreat a word?	999
	999
	[BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper]	999
	999
DECIUS BRUTUS	Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?	999
	999
CASCA	No.	999
	999
CINNA	O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines	999
	That fret the clouds are messengers of day.	999
	999
CASCA	You shall confess that you are both deceived.	999
	Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,	999
	Which is a great way growing on the south,	999
	Weighing the youthful season of the year.	999
	Some two months hence up higher toward the north	999
	He first presents his fire; and the high east	999
	Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Give me your hands all over, one by one.	999
	999
CASSIUS	And let us swear our resolution.	999
	999
BRUTUS	No, not an oath: if not the face of men,	999
	The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--	999
	If these be motives weak, break off betimes,	999
	And every man hence to his idle bed;	999
	So let high-sighted tyranny range on,	999
	Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,	999
	As I am sure they do, bear fire enough	999
	To kindle cowards and to steel with valour	999
	The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,	999
	What need we any spur but our own cause,	999
	To prick us to redress? what other bond	999
	Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,	999
	And will not palter? and what other oath	999
	Than honesty to honesty engaged,	999
	That this shall be, or we will fall for it?	999
	Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,	999
	Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls	999
	That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear	999
	Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain	999
	The even virtue of our enterprise,	999
	Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,	999
	To think that or our cause or our performance	999
	Did need an oath; when every drop of blood	999
	That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,	999
	Is guilty of a several bastardy,	999
	If he do break the smallest particle	999
	Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.	999
	999
CASSIUS	But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?	999
	I think he will stand very strong with us.	999
	999
CASCA	Let us not leave him out.	999
	999
CINNA	No, by no means.	999
	999
METELLUS CIMBER	O, let us have him, for his silver hairs	999
	Will purchase us a good opinion	999
	And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:	999
	It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;	999
	Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,	999
	But all be buried in his gravity.	999
	999
BRUTUS	O, name him not: let us not break with him;	999
	For he will never follow any thing	999
	That other men begin.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Then leave him out.	999
	999
CASCA	Indeed he is not fit.	999
	999
DECIUS BRUTUS	Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?	999
	999
CASSIUS	Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,	999
	Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,	999
	Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him	999
	A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,	999
	If he improve them, may well stretch so far	999
	As to annoy us all: which to prevent,	999
	Let Antony and Caesar fall together.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,	999
	To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,	999
	Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;	999
	For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:	999
	Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.	999
	We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;	999
	And in the spirit of men there is no blood:	999
	O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,	999
	And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,	999
	Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,	999
	Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;	999
	Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,	999
	Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:	999
	And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,	999
	Stir up their servants to an act of rage,	999
	And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make	999
	Our purpose necessary and not envious:	999
	Which so appearing to the common eyes,	999
	We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.	999
	And for Mark Antony, think not of him;	999
	For he can do no more than Caesar's arm	999
	When Caesar's head is off.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Yet I fear him;	999
	For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--	999
	999
BRUTUS	Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:	999
	If he love Caesar, all that he can do	999
	Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:	999
	And that were much he should; for he is given	999
	To sports, to wildness and much company.	999
	999
TREBONIUS	There is no fear in him; let him not die;	999
	For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.	999
	999
	[Clock strikes]	999
	999
BRUTUS	Peace! count the clock.	999
	999
CASSIUS	The clock hath stricken three.	999
	999
TREBONIUS	'Tis time to part.	999
	999
CASSIUS	                  But it is doubtful yet,	999
	Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;	999
	For he is superstitious grown of late,	999
	Quite from the main opinion he held once	999
	Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:	999
	It may be, these apparent prodigies,	999
	The unaccustom'd terror of this night,	999
	And the persuasion of his augurers,	999
	May hold him from the Capitol to-day.	999
	999
DECIUS BRUTUS	Never fear that: if he be so resolved,	999
	I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear	999
	That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,	999
	And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,	999
	Lions with toils and men with flatterers;	999
	But when I tell him he hates flatterers,	999
	He says he does, being then most flattered.	999
	Let me work;	999
	For I can give his humour the true bent,	999
	And I will bring him to the Capitol.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.	999
	999
BRUTUS	By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?	999
	999
CINNA	Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.	999
	999
METELLUS CIMBER	Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,	999
	Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:	999
	I wonder none of you have thought of him.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Now, good Metellus, go along by him:	999
	He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;	999
	Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.	999
	999
CASSIUS	The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.	999
	And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember	999
	What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;	999
	Let not our looks put on our purposes,	999
	But bear it as our Roman actors do,	999
	With untired spirits and formal constancy:	999
	And so good morrow to you every one.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but BRUTUS]	999
	999
	Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;	999
	Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:	999
	Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,	999
	Which busy care draws in the brains of men;	999
	Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.	999
	999
	[Enter PORTIA]	999
	999
PORTIA	Brutus, my lord!	999
	999
BRUTUS	Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?	999
	It is not for your health thus to commit	999
	Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.	999
	999
PORTIA	Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,	999
	Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,	999
	You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,	999
	Musing and sighing, with your arms across,	999
	And when I ask'd you what the matter was,	999
	You stared upon me with ungentle looks;	999
	I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,	999
	And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;	999
	Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,	999
	But, with an angry wafture of your hand,	999
	Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;	999
	Fearing to strengthen that impatience	999
	Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal	999
	Hoping it was but an effect of humour,	999
	Which sometime hath his hour with every man.	999
	It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,	999
	And could it work so much upon your shape	999
	As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,	999
	I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,	999
	Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.	999
	999
BRUTUS	I am not well in health, and that is all.	999
	999
PORTIA	Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,	999
	He would embrace the means to come by it.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.	999
	999
PORTIA	Is Brutus sick? and is it physical	999
	To walk unbraced and suck up the humours	999
	Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,	999
	And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,	999
	To dare the vile contagion of the night	999
	And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air	999
	To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;	999
	You have some sick offence within your mind,	999
	Which, by the right and virtue of my place,	999
	I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,	999
	I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,	999
	By all your vows of love and that great vow	999
	Which did incorporate and make us one,	999
	That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,	999
	Why you are heavy, and what men to-night	999
	Have had to resort to you: for here have been	999
	Some six or seven, who did hide their faces	999
	Even from darkness.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Kneel not, gentle Portia.	999
	999
PORTIA	I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.	999
	Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,	999
	Is it excepted I should know no secrets	999
	That appertain to you? Am I yourself	999
	But, as it were, in sort or limitation,	999
	To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,	999
	And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs	999
	Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,	999
	Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.	999
	999
BRUTUS	You are my true and honourable wife,	999
	As dear to me as are the ruddy drops	999
	That visit my sad heart	999
	999
PORTIA	If this were true, then should I know this secret.	999
	I grant I am a woman; but withal	999
	A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:	999
	I grant I am a woman; but withal	999
	A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.	999
	Think you I am no stronger than my sex,	999
	Being so father'd and so husbanded?	999
	Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:	999
	I have made strong proof of my constancy,	999
	Giving myself a voluntary wound	999
	Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.	999
	And not my husband's secrets?	999
	999
BRUTUS	O ye gods,	999
	999
	Render me worthy of this noble wife!	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	999
	Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;	999
	And by and by thy bosom shall partake	999
	The secrets of my heart.	999
	All my engagements I will construe to thee,	999
	All the charactery of my sad brows:	999
	Leave me with haste.	999
	999
	[Exit PORTIA]	999
	999
		Lucius, who's that knocks?	999
	999
	[Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS]	999
	999
LUCIUS	He is a sick man that would speak with you.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.	999
	Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?	999
	999
LIGARIUS	Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.	999
	999
BRUTUS	O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,	999
	To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!	999
	999
LIGARIUS	I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand	999
	Any exploit worthy the name of honour.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,	999
	Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.	999
	999
LIGARIUS	By all the gods that Romans bow before,	999
	I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!	999
	Brave son, derived from honourable loins!	999
	Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up	999
	My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,	999
	And I will strive with things impossible;	999
	Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?	999
	999
BRUTUS	A piece of work that will make sick men whole.	999
	999
LIGARIUS	But are not some whole that we must make sick?	999
	999
BRUTUS	That must we also. What it is, my Caius,	999
	I shall unfold to thee, as we are going	999
	To whom it must be done.	999
	999
LIGARIUS	Set on your foot,	999
	And with a heart new-fired I follow you,	999
	To do I know not what: but it sufficeth	999
	That Brutus leads me on.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Follow me, then.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	CAESAR's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his	999
	night-gown]	999
	999
CAESAR	Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:	999
	Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,	999
	'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
Servant	My lord?	999
	999
CAESAR	Go bid the priests do present sacrifice	999
	And bring me their opinions of success.	999
	999
Servant	I will, my lord.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter CALPURNIA]	999
	999
CALPURNIA	What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?	999
	You shall not stir out of your house to-day.	999
	999
CAESAR	Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me	999
	Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see	999
	The face of Caesar, they are vanished.	999
	999
CALPURNIA	Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,	999
	Yet now they fright me. There is one within,	999
	Besides the things that we have heard and seen,	999
	Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.	999
	A lioness hath whelped in the streets;	999
	And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;	999
	Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,	999
	In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,	999
	Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;	999
	The noise of battle hurtled in the air,	999
	Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,	999
	And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.	999
	O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,	999
	And I do fear them.	999
	999
CAESAR	What can be avoided	999
	Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?	999
	Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions	999
	Are to the world in general as to Caesar.	999
	999
CALPURNIA	When beggars die, there are no comets seen;	999
	The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.	999
	999
CAESAR	Cowards die many times before their deaths;	999
	The valiant never taste of death but once.	999
	Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.	999
	It seems to me most strange that men should fear;	999
	Seeing that death, a necessary end,	999
	Will come when it will come.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Servant]	999
	999
		       What say the augurers?	999
	999
Servant	They would not have you to stir forth to-day.	999
	Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,	999
	They could not find a heart within the beast.	999
	999
CAESAR	The gods do this in shame of cowardice:	999
	Caesar should be a beast without a heart,	999
	If he should stay at home to-day for fear.	999
	No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well	999
	That Caesar is more dangerous than he:	999
	We are two lions litter'd in one day,	999
	And I the elder and more terrible:	999
	And Caesar shall go forth.	999
	999
CALPURNIA	Alas, my lord,	999
	Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.	999
	Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear	999
	That keeps you in the house, and not your own.	999
	We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:	999
	And he shall say you are not well to-day:	999
	Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.	999
	999
CAESAR	Mark Antony shall say I am not well,	999
	And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.	999
	999
	[Enter DECIUS BRUTUS]	999
	999
	Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.	999
	999
DECIUS BRUTUS	Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:	999
	I come to fetch you to the senate-house.	999
	999
CAESAR	And you are come in very happy time,	999
	To bear my greeting to the senators	999
	And tell them that I will not come to-day:	999
	Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:	999
	I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.	999
	999
CALPURNIA	Say he is sick.	999
	999
CAESAR	                  Shall Caesar send a lie?	999
	Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,	999
	To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?	999
	Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.	999
	999
DECIUS BRUTUS	Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,	999
	Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.	999
	999
CAESAR	The cause is in my will: I will not come;	999
	That is enough to satisfy the senate.	999
	But for your private satisfaction,	999
	Because I love you, I will let you know:	999
	Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:	999
	She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,	999
	Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,	999
	Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans	999
	Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:	999
	And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,	999
	And evils imminent; and on her knee	999
	Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.	999
	999
DECIUS BRUTUS	This dream is all amiss interpreted;	999
	It was a vision fair and fortunate:	999
	Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,	999
	In which so many smiling Romans bathed,	999
	Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck	999
	Reviving blood, and that great men shall press	999
	For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.	999
	This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.	999
	999
CAESAR	And this way have you well expounded it.	999
	999
DECIUS BRUTUS	I have, when you have heard what I can say:	999
	And know it now: the senate have concluded	999
	To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.	999
	If you shall send them word you will not come,	999
	Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock	999
	Apt to be render'd, for some one to say	999
	'Break up the senate till another time,	999
	When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'	999
	If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper	999
	'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?	999
	Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love	999
	To our proceeding bids me tell you this;	999
	And reason to my love is liable.	999
	999
CAESAR	How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!	999
	I am ashamed I did yield to them.	999
	Give me my robe, for I will go.	999
	999
	[Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA,	999
	TREBONIUS, and CINNA]	999
	999
	And look where Publius is come to fetch me.	999
	999
PUBLIUS	Good morrow, Caesar.	999
	999
CAESAR	Welcome, Publius.	999
	What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?	999
	Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,	999
	Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy	999
	As that same ague which hath made you lean.	999
	What is 't o'clock?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.	999
	999
CAESAR	I thank you for your pains and courtesy.	999
	999
	[Enter ANTONY]	999
	999
	See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,	999
	Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.	999
	999
ANTONY	So to most noble Caesar.	999
	999
CAESAR	Bid them prepare within:	999
	I am to blame to be thus waited for.	999
	Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!	999
	I have an hour's talk in store for you;	999
	Remember that you call on me to-day:	999
	Be near me, that I may remember you.	999
	999
TREBONIUS	Caesar, I will:	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	and so near will I be,	999
	That your best friends shall wish I had been further.	999
	999
CAESAR	Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;	999
	And we, like friends, will straightway go together.	999
	999
BRUTUS	[Aside]  That every like is not the same, O Caesar,	999
	The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!	999

	999
SCENE III	A street near the Capitol.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ARTEMIDORUS, reading a paper]	999
	999
ARTEMIDORUS	'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;	999
	come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not	999
	Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus	999
	loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.	999
	There is but one mind in all these men, and it is	999
	bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,	999
	look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.	999
	The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,	999
		'ARTEMIDORUS.'	999
	Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,	999
	And as a suitor will I give him this.	999
	My heart laments that virtue cannot live	999
	Out of the teeth of emulation.	999
	If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;	999
	If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.	999

	999
SCENE IV	Another part of the same street, before the house of BRUTUS.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS]	999
	999
PORTIA	I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;	999
	Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:	999
	Why dost thou stay?	999
	999
LUCIUS	To know my errand, madam.	999
	999
PORTIA	I would have had thee there, and here again,	999
	Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.	999
	O constancy, be strong upon my side,	999
	Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!	999
	I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.	999
	How hard it is for women to keep counsel!	999
	Art thou here yet?	999
	999
LUCIUS	                  Madam, what should I do?	999
	Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?	999
	And so return to you, and nothing else?	999
	999
PORTIA	Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,	999
	For he went sickly forth: and take good note	999
	What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.	999
	Hark, boy! what noise is that?	999
	999
LUCIUS	I hear none, madam.	999
	999
PORTIA	Prithee, listen well;	999
	I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,	999
	And the wind brings it from the Capitol.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.	999
	999
	[Enter the Soothsayer]	999
	999
PORTIA	Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?	999
	999
Soothsayer	At mine own house, good lady.	999
	999
PORTIA	What is't o'clock?	999
	999
Soothsayer	                  About the ninth hour, lady.	999
	999
PORTIA	Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?	999
	999
Soothsayer	Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,	999
	To see him pass on to the Capitol.	999
	999
PORTIA	Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?	999
	999
Soothsayer	That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar	999
	To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,	999
	I shall beseech him to befriend himself.	999
	999
PORTIA	Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?	999
	999
Soothsayer	None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.	999
	Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:	999
	The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,	999
	Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,	999
	Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:	999
	I'll get me to a place more void, and there	999
	Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PORTIA	I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing	999
	The heart of woman is! O Brutus,	999
	The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!	999
	Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit	999
	That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.	999
	Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;	999
	Say I am merry: come to me again,	999
	And bring me word what he doth say to thee.	999

	TREBONIUS, CINNA, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POPILIUS,	999
	PUBLIUS, and others]	999
	999
CAESAR	[To the Soothsayer]  The ides of March are come.	999
	999
Soothsayer	Ay, Caesar; but not gone.	999
	999
ARTEMIDORUS	Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.	999
	999
DECIUS BRUTUS	Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,	999
	At your best leisure, this his humble suit.	999
	999
ARTEMIDORUS	O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit	999
	That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.	999
	999
CAESAR	What touches us ourself shall be last served.	999
	999
ARTEMIDORUS	Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.	999
	999
CAESAR	What, is the fellow mad?	999
	999
PUBLIUS	Sirrah, give place.	999
	999
CASSIUS	What, urge you your petitions in the street?	999
	Come to the Capitol.	999
	999
	[CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest	999
	following]	999
	999
POPILIUS	I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.	999
	999
CASSIUS	What enterprise, Popilius?	999
	999
POPILIUS	Fare you well.	999
	999
	[Advances to CAESAR]	999
	999
BRUTUS	What said Popilius Lena?	999
	999
CASSIUS	He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.	999
	I fear our purpose is discovered.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.	999
	Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,	999
	Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,	999
	For I will slay myself.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Cassius, be constant:	999
	Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;	999
	For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.	999
	He draws Mark Antony out of the way.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS]	999
	999
DECIUS BRUTUS	Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,	999
	And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.	999
	999
BRUTUS	He is address'd: press near and second him.	999
	999
CINNA	Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.	999
	999
CAESAR	Are we all ready? What is now amiss	999
	That Caesar and his senate must redress?	999
	999
METELLUS CIMBER	Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,	999
	Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat	999
	An humble heart,--	999
	999
	[Kneeling]	999
	999
CAESAR	                  I must prevent thee, Cimber.	999
	These couchings and these lowly courtesies	999
	Might fire the blood of ordinary men,	999
	And turn pre-ordinance and first decree	999
	Into the law of children. Be not fond,	999
	To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood	999
	That will be thaw'd from the true quality	999
	With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,	999
	Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.	999
	Thy brother by decree is banished:	999
	If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,	999
	I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.	999
	Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause	999
	Will he be satisfied.	999
	999
METELLUS CIMBER	Is there no voice more worthy than my own	999
	To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear	999
	For the repealing of my banish'd brother?	999
	999
BRUTUS	I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;	999
	Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may	999
	Have an immediate freedom of repeal.	999
	999
CAESAR	What, Brutus!	999
	999
CASSIUS	                  Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:	999
	As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,	999
	To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.	999
	999
CASSIUS	I could be well moved, if I were as you:	999
	If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:	999
	But I am constant as the northern star,	999
	Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality	999
	There is no fellow in the firmament.	999
	The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,	999
	They are all fire and every one doth shine,	999
	But there's but one in all doth hold his place:	999
	So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,	999
	And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;	999
	Yet in the number I do know but one	999
	That unassailable holds on his rank,	999
	Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,	999
	Let me a little show it, even in this;	999
	That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,	999
	And constant do remain to keep him so.	999
	999
CINNA	O Caesar,--	999
	999
CAESAR	          Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?	999
	999

	999

	999
	[CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and	999

	999
CAESAR	Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
CINNA	Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!	999
	Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Some to the common pulpits, and cry out	999
	'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'	999
	999
BRUTUS	People and senators, be not affrighted;	999
	Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.	999
	999
CASCA	Go to the pulpit, Brutus.	999
	999
DECIUS BRUTUS	And Cassius too.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Where's Publius?	999
	999
CINNA	Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.	999
	999
METELLUS CIMBER	Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's	999
	Should chance--	999
	999
BRUTUS	Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;	999
	There is no harm intended to your person,	999
	Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.	999
	999
CASSIUS	And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,	999
	Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Do so: and let no man abide this deed,	999
	But we the doers.	999
	999
	[Re-enter TREBONIUS]	999
	999
CASSIUS	                  Where is Antony?	999

	As it were doomsday.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Fates, we will know your pleasures:	999
	That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time	999
	And drawing days out, that men stand upon.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life	999
	Cuts off so many years of fearing death.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Grant that, and then is death a benefit:	999
	So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged	999
	His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,	999
	And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood	999
	Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:	999
	Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,	999
	And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,	999
	Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'	999
	999
CASSIUS	Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence	999
	Shall this our lofty scene be acted over	999
	In states unborn and accents yet unknown!	999
	999
BRUTUS	How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,	999
	That now on Pompey's basis lies along	999
	No worthier than the dust!	999
	999
CASSIUS	So oft as that shall be,	999
	So often shall the knot of us be call'd	999
	The men that gave their country liberty.	999
	999
DECIUS BRUTUS	What, shall we forth?	999
	999
CASSIUS	Ay, every man away:	999
	Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels	999
	With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
BRUTUS	Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.	999
	999
Servant	Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:	999
	Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;	999
	And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:	999
	Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;	999
	Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:	999
	Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;	999
	Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.	999
	If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony	999
	May safely come to him, and be resolved	999
	How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,	999
	Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead	999
	So well as Brutus living; but will follow	999
	The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus	999
	Thorough the hazards of this untrod state	999
	With all true faith. So says my master Antony.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;	999
	I never thought him worse.	999
	Tell him, so please him come unto this place,	999
	He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,	999
	Depart untouch'd.	999
	999
Servant	                  I'll fetch him presently.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BRUTUS	I know that we shall have him well to friend.	999
	999
CASSIUS	I wish we may: but yet have I a mind	999
	That fears him much; and my misgiving still	999
	Falls shrewdly to the purpose.	999
	999
BRUTUS	But here comes Antony.	999
	999
	[Re-enter ANTONY]	999
	999
		 Welcome, Mark Antony.	999
	999
ANTONY	O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?	999
	Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,	999
	Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.	999
	I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,	999
	Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:	999
	If I myself, there is no hour so fit	999
	As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument	999
	Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich	999
	With the most noble blood of all this world.	999
	I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,	999
	Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,	999
	Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,	999
	I shall not find myself so apt to die:	999
	No place will please me so, no mean of death,	999
	As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,	999
	The choice and master spirits of this age.	999
	999
BRUTUS	O Antony, beg not your death of us.	999
	Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,	999
	As, by our hands and this our present act,	999
	You see we do, yet see you but our hands	999
	And this the bleeding business they have done:	999
	Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;	999
	And pity to the general wrong of Rome--	999
	As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--	999
	Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,	999
	To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:	999
	Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts	999
	Of brothers' temper, do receive you in	999
	With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Your voice shall be as strong as any man's	999
	In the disposing of new dignities.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Only be patient till we have appeased	999
	The multitude, beside themselves with fear,	999
	And then we will deliver you the cause,	999
	Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,	999
	Have thus proceeded.	999
	999
ANTONY	I doubt not of your wisdom.	999
	Let each man render me his bloody hand:	999
	First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;	999
	Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;	999
	Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;	999
	Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;	999
	Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.	999
	Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?	999
	My credit now stands on such slippery ground,	999
	That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,	999
	Either a coward or a flatterer.	999
	That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:	999
	If then thy spirit look upon us now,	999
	Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,	999
	To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,	999
	Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,	999
	Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?	999
	Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,	999
	Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,	999
	It would become me better than to close	999
	In terms of friendship with thine enemies.	999
	Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;	999
	Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,	999
	Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.	999
	O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;	999
	And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.	999
	How like a deer, strucken by many princes,	999
	Dost thou here lie!	999
	999
CASSIUS	Mark Antony,--	999
	999
ANTONY	                  Pardon me, Caius Cassius:	999
	The enemies of Caesar shall say this;	999
	Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.	999
	999
CASSIUS	I blame you not for praising Caesar so;	999
	But what compact mean you to have with us?	999
	Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;	999
	Or shall we on, and not depend on you?	999
	999
ANTONY	Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,	999
	Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.	999
	Friends am I with you all and love you all,	999
	Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons	999
	Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Or else were this a savage spectacle:	999
	Our reasons are so full of good regard	999
	That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,	999
	You should be satisfied.	999
	999
ANTONY	That's all I seek:	999
	And am moreover suitor that I may	999
	Produce his body to the market-place;	999
	And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,	999
	Speak in the order of his funeral.	999
	999
BRUTUS	You shall, Mark Antony.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Brutus, a word with you.	999
	999
	[Aside to BRUTUS]	999
	999
	You know not what you do: do not consent	999
	That Antony speak in his funeral:	999
	Know you how much the people may be moved	999
	By that which he will utter?	999
	999
BRUTUS	By your pardon;	999
	I will myself into the pulpit first,	999
	And show the reason of our Caesar's death:	999
	What Antony shall speak, I will protest	999
	He speaks by leave and by permission,	999
	And that we are contented Caesar shall	999
	Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.	999
	It shall advantage more than do us wrong.	999
	999
CASSIUS	I know not what may fall; I like it not.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.	999
	You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,	999
	But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,	999
	And say you do't by our permission;	999
	Else shall you not have any hand at all	999
	About his funeral: and you shall speak	999
	In the same pulpit whereto I am going,	999
	After my speech is ended.	999
	999
ANTONY	Be it so.	999
	I do desire no more.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Prepare the body then, and follow us.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but ANTONY]	999
	999
ANTONY	O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,	999
	That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!	999
	Thou art the ruins of the noblest man	999
	That ever lived in the tide of times.	999
	Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!	999
	Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--	999
	Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,	999
	To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--	999
	A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;	999
	Domestic fury and fierce civil strife	999
	Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;	999
	Blood and destruction shall be so in use	999
	And dreadful objects so familiar	999
	That mothers shall but smile when they behold	999
	Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;	999
	All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:	999
	And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,	999
	With Ate by his side come hot from hell,	999
	Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice	999
	Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;	999
	That this foul deed shall smell above the earth	999
	With carrion men, groaning for burial.	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
	You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?	999
	999
Servant	I do, Mark Antony.	999
	999
ANTONY	Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.	999
	999
Servant	He did receive his letters, and is coming;	999
	And bid me say to you by word of mouth--	999
	O Caesar!--	999
	999
	[Seeing the body]	999
	999
ANTONY	Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.	999
	Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,	999
	Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,	999
	Began to water. Is thy master coming?	999
	999
Servant	He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.	999
	999
ANTONY	Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:	999
	Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,	999
	No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;	999
	Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;	999
	Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse	999
	Into the market-place: there shall I try	999
	In my oration, how the people take	999
	The cruel issue of these bloody men;	999
	According to the which, thou shalt discourse	999
	To young Octavius of the state of things.	999
	Lend me your hand.	999
	999
	[Exeunt with CAESAR's body]	999
	999
	999
	999
	999
	JULIUS CAESAR	999
	999
	999
ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	The Forum.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens]	999
	999
Citizens	We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.	999
	Cassius, go you into the other street,	999
	And part the numbers.	999
	Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;	999
	Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;	999
	And public reasons shall be rendered	999
	Of Caesar's death.	999
	999
First Citizen	                  I will hear Brutus speak.	999
	999
Second Citizen	I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,	999
	When severally we hear them rendered.	999
	999
	[Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS	999
	goes into the pulpit]	999
	999
Third Citizen	The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!	999
	999
BRUTUS	Be patient till the last.	999
	999
	Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my	999
	cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me	999
	for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that	999
	you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and	999
	awake your senses, that you may the better judge.	999
	If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of	999
	Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar	999
	was no less than his. If then that friend demand	999
	why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:	999
	--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved	999
	Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and	999
	die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live	999
	all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;	999
	as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was	999
	valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I	999
	slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his	999
	fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his	999
	ambition. Who is here so base that would be a	999
	bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.	999
	Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If	999
	any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so	999
	vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;	999
	for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.	999
	999
All	None, Brutus, none.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Then none have I offended. I have done no more to	999
	Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of	999
	his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not	999
	extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences	999
	enforced, for which he suffered death.	999
	999
	[Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body]	999
	999
	Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,	999
	though he had no hand in his death, shall receive	999
	the benefit of his dying, a place in the	999
	commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this	999
	I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the	999
	good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,	999
	when it shall please my country to need my death.	999
	999
All	Live, Brutus! live, live!	999
	999
First Citizen	Bring him with triumph home unto his house.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Give him a statue with his ancestors.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Let him be Caesar.	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	                  Caesar's better parts	999
	Shall be crown'd in Brutus.	999
	999
First Citizen	We'll bring him to his house	999
	With shouts and clamours.	999
	999
BRUTUS	My countrymen,--	999
	999
Second Citizen	Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.	999
	999
First Citizen	Peace, ho!	999
	999
BRUTUS	Good countrymen, let me depart alone,	999
	And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:	999
	Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech	999
	Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,	999
	By our permission, is allow'd to make.	999
	I do entreat you, not a man depart,	999
	Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
First Citizen	Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Let him go up into the public chair;	999
	We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.	999
	999
ANTONY	For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.	999
	999
	[Goes into the pulpit]	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	What does he say of Brutus?	999
	999
Third Citizen	He says, for Brutus' sake,	999
	He finds himself beholding to us all.	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.	999
	999
First Citizen	This Caesar was a tyrant.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Nay, that's certain:	999
	We are blest that Rome is rid of him.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.	999
	999
ANTONY	You gentle Romans,--	999
	999
Citizens	Peace, ho! let us hear him.	999
	999
ANTONY	Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;	999
	I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.	999
	The evil that men do lives after them;	999
	The good is oft interred with their bones;	999
	So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus	999
	Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:	999
	If it were so, it was a grievous fault,	999
	And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.	999
	Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--	999
	For Brutus is an honourable man;	999
	So are they all, all honourable men--	999
	Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.	999
	He was my friend, faithful and just to me:	999
	But Brutus says he was ambitious;	999
	And Brutus is an honourable man.	999
	He hath brought many captives home to Rome	999
	Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:	999
	Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?	999
	When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:	999
	Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:	999
	Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;	999
	And Brutus is an honourable man.	999
	You all did see that on the Lupercal	999
	I thrice presented him a kingly crown,	999
	Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?	999
	Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;	999
	And, sure, he is an honourable man.	999
	I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,	999
	But here I am to speak what I do know.	999
	You all did love him once, not without cause:	999
	What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?	999
	O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,	999
	And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;	999
	My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,	999
	And I must pause till it come back to me.	999
	999
First Citizen	Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.	999
	999
Second Citizen	If thou consider rightly of the matter,	999
	Caesar has had great wrong.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Has he, masters?	999
	I fear there will a worse come in his place.	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;	999
	Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.	999
	999
First Citizen	If it be found so, some will dear abide it.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.	999
	999
Third Citizen	There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	Now mark him, he begins again to speak.	999
	999
ANTONY	But yesterday the word of Caesar might	999
	Have stood against the world; now lies he there.	999
	And none so poor to do him reverence.	999
	O masters, if I were disposed to stir	999
	Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,	999
	I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,	999
	Who, you all know, are honourable men:	999
	I will not do them wrong; I rather choose	999
	To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,	999
	Than I will wrong such honourable men.	999
	But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;	999
	I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:	999
	Let but the commons hear this testament--	999
	Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--	999
	And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds	999
	And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,	999
	Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,	999
	And, dying, mention it within their wills,	999
	Bequeathing it as a rich legacy	999
	Unto their issue.	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.	999
	999
All	The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.	999
	999
ANTONY	Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;	999
	It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.	999
	You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;	999
	And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,	999
	It will inflame you, it will make you mad:	999
	'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;	999
	For, if you should, O, what would come of it!	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;	999
	You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.	999
	999
ANTONY	Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?	999
	I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:	999
	I fear I wrong the honourable men	999
	Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	They were traitors: honourable men!	999
	999
All	The will! the testament!	999
	999
Second Citizen	They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.	999
	999
ANTONY	You will compel me, then, to read the will?	999
	Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,	999
	And let me show you him that made the will.	999
	Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?	999
	999
Several Citizens	Come down.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Descend.	999
	999
Third Citizen	You shall have leave.	999
	999
	[ANTONY comes down]	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	A ring; stand round.	999
	999
First Citizen	Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Room for Antony, most noble Antony.	999
	999
ANTONY	Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.	999
	999
Several Citizens	Stand back; room; bear back.	999
	999
ANTONY	If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.	999
	You all do know this mantle: I remember	999
	The first time ever Caesar put it on;	999
	'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,	999
	That day he overcame the Nervii:	999
	Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:	999
	See what a rent the envious Casca made:	999
	Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;	999
	And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,	999
	Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,	999
	As rushing out of doors, to be resolved	999
	If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;	999
	For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:	999
	Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!	999
	This was the most unkindest cut of all;	999
	For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,	999
	Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,	999
	Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;	999
	And, in his mantle muffling up his face,	999
	Even at the base of Pompey's statua,	999
	Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.	999
	O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!	999
	Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,	999
	Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.	999
	O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel	999
	The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.	999
	Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold	999
	Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,	999
	Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.	999
	999
First Citizen	O piteous spectacle!	999
	999
Second Citizen	O noble Caesar!	999
	999
Third Citizen	O woful day!	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	O traitors, villains!	999
	999
First Citizen	O most bloody sight!	999
	999
Second Citizen	We will be revenged.	999
	999
All	Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!	999
	Let not a traitor live!	999
	999
ANTONY	Stay, countrymen.	999
	999
First Citizen	Peace there! hear the noble Antony.	999
	999
Second Citizen	We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.	999
	999
ANTONY	Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up	999
	To such a sudden flood of mutiny.	999
	They that have done this deed are honourable:	999
	What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,	999
	That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,	999
	And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.	999
	I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:	999
	I am no orator, as Brutus is;	999
	But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,	999
	That love my friend; and that they know full well	999
	That gave me public leave to speak of him:	999
	For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,	999
	Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,	999
	To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;	999
	I tell you that which you yourselves do know;	999
	Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,	999
	And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,	999
	And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony	999
	Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue	999
	In every wound of Caesar that should move	999
	The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.	999
	999
All	We'll mutiny.	999
	999
First Citizen	We'll burn the house of Brutus.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.	999
	999
ANTONY	Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.	999
	999
All	Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!	999
	999
ANTONY	Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:	999
	Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?	999
	Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:	999
	You have forgot the will I told you of.	999
	999
All	Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.	999
	999
ANTONY	Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.	999
	To every Roman citizen he gives,	999
	To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.	999
	999
Third Citizen	O royal Caesar!	999
	999
ANTONY	Hear me with patience.	999
	999
All	Peace, ho!	999
	999
ANTONY	Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,	999
	His private arbours and new-planted orchards,	999
	On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,	999
	And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,	999
	To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.	999
	Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?	999
	999
First Citizen	Never, never. Come, away, away!	999
	We'll burn his body in the holy place,	999
	And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.	999
	Take up the body.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Go fetch fire.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Pluck down benches.	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Citizens with the body]	999
	999
ANTONY	Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,	999
	Take thou what course thou wilt!	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
		                  How now, fellow!	999
	999
Servant	Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.	999
	999
ANTONY	Where is he?	999
	999
Servant	He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.	999
	999
ANTONY	And thither will I straight to visit him:	999
	He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,	999
	And in this mood will give us any thing.	999
	999
Servant	I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius	999
	Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.	999
	999
ANTONY	Belike they had some notice of the people,	999
	How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.	999

	[Enter CINNA the poet]	999
	999
CINNA THE POET	I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,	999
	And things unlucky charge my fantasy:	999
	I have no will to wander forth of doors,	999
	Yet something leads me forth.	999
	999
	[Enter Citizens]	999
	999
First Citizen	What is your name?	999
	999
Second Citizen	Whither are you going?	999
	999
Third Citizen	Where do you dwell?	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	Are you a married man or a bachelor?	999
	999
Second Citizen	Answer every man directly.	999
	999
First Citizen	Ay, and briefly.	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	Ay, and wisely.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Ay, and truly, you were best.	999
	999
CINNA THE POET	What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I	999
	dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to	999
	answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and	999
	truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.	999
	999
Second Citizen	That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:	999
	you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.	999
	999
CINNA THE POET	Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.	999
	999
First Citizen	As a friend or an enemy?	999
	999
CINNA THE POET	As a friend.	999
	999
Second Citizen	That matter is answered directly.	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	For your dwelling,--briefly.	999
	999
CINNA THE POET	Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Your name, sir, truly.	999
	999
CINNA THE POET	Truly, my name is Cinna.	999
	999
First Citizen	Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.	999
	999
CINNA THE POET	I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.	999
	999
CINNA THE POET	I am not Cinna the conspirator.	999
	999
Fourth Citizen	It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his	999
	name out of his heart, and turn him going.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Tear him, tear him! Come, brands ho! fire-brands:	999
	to Brutus', to Cassius'; burn all: some to Decius'	999

	999
	999
	[ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS, seated at a table]	999
	999
ANTONY	These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?	999
	999
LEPIDUS	I do consent--	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	                  Prick him down, Antony.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	Upon condition Publius shall not live,	999
	Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.	999
	999
ANTONY	He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.	999
	But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;	999
	Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine	999
	How to cut off some charge in legacies.	999
	999
LEPIDUS	What, shall I find you here?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	Or here, or at the Capitol.	999
	999
	[Exit LEPIDUS]	999
	999
ANTONY	This is a slight unmeritable man,	999
	Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,	999
	The three-fold world divided, he should stand	999
	One of the three to share it?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	So you thought him;	999
	And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,	999
	In our black sentence and proscription.	999
	999
ANTONY	Octavius, I have seen more days than you:	999
	And though we lay these honours on this man,	999
	To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,	999
	He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,	999
	To groan and sweat under the business,	999
	Either led or driven, as we point the way;	999
	And having brought our treasure where we will,	999
	Then take we down his load, and turn him off,	999
	Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,	999
	And graze in commons.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	You may do your will;	999
	But he's a tried and valiant soldier.	999
	999
ANTONY	So is my horse, Octavius; and for that	999
	I do appoint him store of provender:	999
	It is a creature that I teach to fight,	999
	To wind, to stop, to run directly on,	999
	His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.	999
	And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;	999
	He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;	999
	A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds	999
	On abjects, orts and imitations,	999
	Which, out of use and staled by other men,	999
	Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,	999
	But as a property. And now, Octavius,	999
	Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius	999
	Are levying powers: we must straight make head:	999
	Therefore let our alliance be combined,	999
	Our best friends made, our means stretch'd	999
	And let us presently go sit in council,	999
	How covert matters may be best disclosed,	999
	And open perils surest answered.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	Let us do so: for we are at the stake,	999
	And bay'd about with many enemies;	999
	And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,	999
	Millions of mischiefs.	999

	999
	999
	[Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and	999
	Soldiers; TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them]	999
	999
BRUTUS	Stand, ho!	999
	999
LUCILIUS	Give the word, ho! and stand.	999
	999
BRUTUS	What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?	999
	999
LUCILIUS	He is at hand; and Pindarus is come	999
	To do you salutation from his master.	999
	999
BRUTUS	He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,	999
	In his own change, or by ill officers,	999
	Hath given me some worthy cause to wish	999
	Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,	999
	I shall be satisfied.	999
	999
PINDARUS	I do not doubt	999
	But that my noble master will appear	999
	Such as he is, full of regard and honour.	999
	999
BRUTUS	He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;	999
	How he received you, let me be resolved.	999
	999
LUCILIUS	With courtesy and with respect enough;	999
	But not with such familiar instances,	999
	Nor with such free and friendly conference,	999
	As he hath used of old.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Thou hast described	999
	A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,	999
	When love begins to sicken and decay,	999
	It useth an enforced ceremony.	999
	There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;	999
	But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,	999
	Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;	999
	But when they should endure the bloody spur,	999
	They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,	999
	Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?	999
	999
LUCILIUS	They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;	999
	The greater part, the horse in general,	999
	Are come with Cassius.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Hark! he is arrived.	999
	999
	[Low march within]	999
	999
	March gently on to meet him.	999
	999
	[Enter CASSIUS and his powers]	999
	999
CASSIUS	Stand, ho!	999
	999
BRUTUS	Stand, ho! Speak the word along.	999
	999
First Soldier	Stand!	999
	999
Second Soldier	Stand!	999
	999
Third Soldier	Stand!	999
	999
CASSIUS	Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?	999
	And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?	999
	999
CASSIUS	Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;	999
	And when you do them--	999
	999
BRUTUS	Cassius, be content.	999
	Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.	999
	Before the eyes of both our armies here,	999
	Which should perceive nothing but love from us,	999
	Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;	999
	Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,	999
	And I will give you audience.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Pindarus,	999
	Bid our commanders lead their charges off	999
	A little from this ground.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man	999

	999
	999
	[Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS]	999
	999
CASSIUS	That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:	999
	You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella	999
	For taking bribes here of the Sardians;	999
	Wherein my letters, praying on his side,	999
	Because I knew the man, were slighted off.	999
	999
BRUTUS	You wronged yourself to write in such a case.	999
	999
CASSIUS	In such a time as this it is not meet	999
	That every nice offence should bear his comment.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself	999
	Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;	999
	To sell and mart your offices for gold	999
	To undeservers.	999
	999
CASSIUS	                  I an itching palm!	999
	You know that you are Brutus that speak this,	999
	Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.	999
	999
BRUTUS	The name of Cassius honours this corruption,	999
	And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Chastisement!	999
	999
BRUTUS	Remember March, the ides of March remember:	999
	Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?	999
	What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,	999
	And not for justice? What, shall one of us	999
	That struck the foremost man of all this world	999
	But for supporting robbers, shall we now	999
	Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,	999
	And sell the mighty space of our large honours	999
	For so much trash as may be grasped thus?	999
	I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,	999
	Than such a Roman.	999
	999
CASSIUS	                  Brutus, bay not me;	999
	I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,	999
	To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,	999
	Older in practise, abler than yourself	999
	To make conditions.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Go to; you are not, Cassius.	999
	999
CASSIUS	I am.	999
	999
BRUTUS	I say you are not.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;	999
	Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Away, slight man!	999
	999
CASSIUS	Is't possible?	999
	999
BRUTUS	                  Hear me, for I will speak.	999
	Must I give way and room to your rash choler?	999
	Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?	999
	999
CASSIUS	O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?	999
	999
BRUTUS	All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;	999
	Go show your slaves how choleric you are,	999
	And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?	999
	Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch	999
	Under your testy humour? By the gods	999
	You shall digest the venom of your spleen,	999
	Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,	999
	I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,	999
	When you are waspish.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Is it come to this?	999
	999
BRUTUS	You say you are a better soldier:	999
	Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,	999
	And it shall please me well: for mine own part,	999
	I shall be glad to learn of noble men.	999
	999
CASSIUS	You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;	999
	I said, an elder soldier, not a better:	999
	Did I say 'better'?	999
	999
BRUTUS	If you did, I care not.	999
	999
CASSIUS	When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.	999
	999
CASSIUS	I durst not!	999
	999
BRUTUS	No.	999
	999
CASSIUS	What, durst not tempt him!	999
	999
BRUTUS	For your life you durst not!	999
	999
CASSIUS	Do not presume too much upon my love;	999
	I may do that I shall be sorry for.	999
	999
BRUTUS	You have done that you should be sorry for.	999
	There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,	999
	For I am arm'd so strong in honesty	999
	That they pass by me as the idle wind,	999
	Which I respect not. I did send to you	999
	For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:	999
	For I can raise no money by vile means:	999
	By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,	999
	And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring	999
	From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash	999
	By any indirection: I did send	999
	To you for gold to pay my legions,	999
	Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?	999
	Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?	999
	When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,	999
	To lock such rascal counters from his friends,	999
	Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;	999
	Dash him to pieces!	999
	999
CASSIUS	I denied you not.	999
	999
BRUTUS	You did.	999
	999
CASSIUS	I did not: he was but a fool that brought	999
	My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:	999
	A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,	999
	But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.	999
	999
BRUTUS	I do not, till you practise them on me.	999
	999
CASSIUS	You love me not.	999
	999
BRUTUS	                  I do not like your faults.	999
	999
CASSIUS	A friendly eye could never see such faults.	999
	999
BRUTUS	A flatterer's would not, though they do appear	999
	As huge as high Olympus.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,	999
	Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,	999
	For Cassius is aweary of the world;	999
	Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;	999
	Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,	999
	Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,	999
	To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep	999
	My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,	999
	And here my naked breast; within, a heart	999
	Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:	999
	If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;	999
	I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:	999
	Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,	999
	When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better	999
	Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Sheathe your dagger:	999
	Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;	999
	Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.	999
	O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb	999
	That carries anger as the flint bears fire;	999
	Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,	999
	And straight is cold again.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Hath Cassius lived	999
	To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,	999
	When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?	999
	999
BRUTUS	When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.	999
	999
BRUTUS	And my heart too.	999
	999
CASSIUS	                  O Brutus!	999
	999
BRUTUS	What's the matter?	999
	999
CASSIUS	Have not you love enough to bear with me,	999
	When that rash humour which my mother gave me	999
	Makes me forgetful?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,	999
	When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,	999
	He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.	999
	999
Poet	[Within]  Let me go in to see the generals;	999
	There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet	999
	They be alone.	999
	999
LUCILIUS	[Within]  You shall not come to them.	999
	999
Poet	[Within]  Nothing but death shall stay me.	999
	999
	[Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS]	999
	999
CASSIUS	How now! what's the matter?	999
	999
Poet	For shame, you generals! what do you mean?	999
	Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;	999
	For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!	999
	999
BRUTUS	Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!	999
	999
CASSIUS	Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.	999
	999
BRUTUS	I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:	999
	What should the wars do with these jigging fools?	999
	Companion, hence!	999
	999
CASSIUS	                  Away, away, be gone.	999
	999
	[Exit Poet]	999
	999
BRUTUS	Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders	999
	Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.	999
	999
CASSIUS	And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you	999
	Immediately to us.	999
	999
	[Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS]	999
	999
BRUTUS	Lucius, a bowl of wine!	999
	999
	[Exit LUCIUS]	999
	999
CASSIUS	I did not think you could have been so angry.	999
	999
BRUTUS	O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Of your philosophy you make no use,	999
	If you give place to accidental evils.	999
	999
BRUTUS	No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Ha! Portia!	999
	999
BRUTUS	She is dead.	999
	999
CASSIUS	How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?	999
	O insupportable and touching loss!	999
	Upon what sickness?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Impatient of my absence,	999
	And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony	999
	Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death	999
	That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,	999
	And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.	999
	999
CASSIUS	And died so?	999
	999
BRUTUS	                  Even so.	999
	999
CASSIUS	O ye immortal gods!	999
	999
	[Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper]	999
	999
BRUTUS	Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.	999
	In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.	999
	999
CASSIUS	My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.	999
	Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;	999
	I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Come in, Titinius!	999
	999
	[Exit LUCIUS]	999
	999
	[Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA]	999
	999
	Welcome, good Messala.	999
	Now sit we close about this taper here,	999
	And call in question our necessities.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Portia, art thou gone?	999
	999
BRUTUS	No more, I pray you.	999
	Messala, I have here received letters,	999
	That young Octavius and Mark Antony	999
	Come down upon us with a mighty power,	999
	Bending their expedition toward Philippi.	999
	999
MESSALA	Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.	999
	999
BRUTUS	With what addition?	999
	999
MESSALA	That by proscription and bills of outlawry,	999
	Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,	999
	Have put to death an hundred senators.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Therein our letters do not well agree;	999
	Mine speak of seventy senators that died	999
	By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Cicero one!	999
	999
MESSALA	          Cicero is dead,	999
	And by that order of proscription.	999
	Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?	999
	999
BRUTUS	No, Messala.	999
	999
MESSALA	Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Nothing, Messala.	999
	999
MESSALA	                  That, methinks, is strange.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?	999
	999
MESSALA	No, my lord.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.	999
	999
MESSALA	Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:	999
	For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:	999
	With meditating that she must die once,	999
	I have the patience to endure it now.	999
	999
MESSALA	Even so great men great losses should endure.	999
	999
CASSIUS	I have as much of this in art as you,	999
	But yet my nature could not bear it so.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Well, to our work alive. What do you think	999
	Of marching to Philippi presently?	999
	999
CASSIUS	I do not think it good.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Your reason?	999
	999
CASSIUS	This it is:	999
	'Tis better that the enemy seek us:	999
	So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,	999
	Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,	999
	Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.	999
	The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground	999
	Do stand but in a forced affection;	999
	For they have grudged us contribution:	999
	The enemy, marching along by them,	999
	By them shall make a fuller number up,	999
	Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;	999
	From which advantage shall we cut him off,	999
	If at Philippi we do face him there,	999
	These people at our back.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Hear me, good brother.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Under your pardon. You must note beside,	999
	That we have tried the utmost of our friends,	999
	Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:	999
	The enemy increaseth every day;	999
	We, at the height, are ready to decline.	999
	There is a tide in the affairs of men,	999
	Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;	999
	Omitted, all the voyage of their life	999
	Is bound in shallows and in miseries.	999
	On such a full sea are we now afloat;	999
	And we must take the current when it serves,	999
	Or lose our ventures.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Then, with your will, go on;	999
	We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.	999
	999
BRUTUS	The deep of night is crept upon our talk,	999
	And nature must obey necessity;	999
	Which we will niggard with a little rest.	999
	There is no more to say?	999
	999
CASSIUS	No more. Good night:	999
	Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Lucius!	999
	999
	[Enter LUCIUS]	999
	My gown.	999
	999
	[Exit LUCIUS]	999
	999
	Farewell, good Messala:	999
	Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,	999
	Good night, and good repose.	999
	999
CASSIUS	O my dear brother!	999
	This was an ill beginning of the night:	999
	Never come such division 'tween our souls!	999
	Let it not, Brutus.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Every thing is well.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Good night, my lord.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Good night, good brother.	999
	999
	999
TITINIUS	|	999
	| Good night, Lord Brutus.	999
MESSALA	|	999
	999
	999
BRUTUS	Farewell, every one.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but BRUTUS]	999
	999
	[Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown]	999
	999
	Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?	999
	999
LUCIUS	Here in the tent.	999
	999
BRUTUS	                  What, thou speak'st drowsily?	999
	Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.	999
	Call Claudius and some other of my men:	999
	I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Varro and Claudius!	999
	999
	[Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS]	999
	999
VARRO	Calls my lord?	999
	999
BRUTUS	I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;	999
	It may be I shall raise you by and by	999
	On business to my brother Cassius.	999
	999
VARRO	So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.	999
	999
BRUTUS	I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;	999
	It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.	999
	Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;	999
	I put it in the pocket of my gown.	999
	999
	[VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down]	999
	999
LUCIUS	I was sure your lordship did not give it me.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.	999
	Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,	999
	And touch thy instrument a strain or two?	999
	999
LUCIUS	Ay, my lord, an't please you.	999
	999
BRUTUS	It does, my boy:	999
	I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.	999
	999
LUCIUS	It is my duty, sir.	999
	999
BRUTUS	I should not urge thy duty past thy might;	999
	I know young bloods look for a time of rest.	999
	999
LUCIUS	I have slept, my lord, already.	999
	999
BRUTUS	It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;	999
	I will not hold thee long: if I do live,	999
	I will be good to thee.	999
	999
	[Music, and a song]	999
	999
	This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,	999
	Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,	999
	That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;	999
	I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:	999
	If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;	999
	I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.	999
	Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down	999
	Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.	999
	999
	[Enter the Ghost of CAESAR]	999
	999
	How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?	999
	I think it is the weakness of mine eyes	999
	That shapes this monstrous apparition.	999
	It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?	999
	Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,	999
	That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?	999
	Speak to me what thou art.	999
	999
GHOST	Thy evil spirit, Brutus.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Why comest thou?	999
	999
GHOST	To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Well; then I shall see thee again?	999
	999
GHOST	Ay, at Philippi.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.	999
	999
	[Exit Ghost]	999
	999
	Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:	999
	Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.	999
	Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!	999
	999
LUCIUS	The strings, my lord, are false.	999
	999
BRUTUS	He thinks he still is at his instrument.	999
	Lucius, awake!	999
	999
LUCIUS	My lord?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?	999
	999
LUCIUS	My lord, I do not know that I did cry.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?	999
	999
LUCIUS	Nothing, my lord.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!	999
	999
	[To VARRO]	999
	999
	Fellow thou, awake!	999
	999
VARRO	My lord?	999
	999
CLAUDIUS	My lord?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?	999
	999
	999
VARRO	|	999
	|  Did we, my lord?	999
CLAUDIUS	|	999
	999
	999
BRUTUS	Ay: saw you any thing?	999
	999
VARRO	No, my lord, I saw nothing.	999
	999
CLAUDIUS	Nor I, my lord.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;	999
	Bid him set on his powers betimes before,	999
	And we will follow.	999
	999
	999
VARRO	|	999
	|                It shall be done, my lord.	999

ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The plains of Philippi.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army]	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:	999
	You said the enemy would not come down,	999
	But keep the hills and upper regions;	999
	It proves not so: their battles are at hand;	999
	They mean to warn us at Philippi here,	999
	Answering before we do demand of them.	999
	999
ANTONY	Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know	999
	Wherefore they do it: they could be content	999
	To visit other places; and come down	999
	With fearful bravery, thinking by this face	999
	To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;	999
	But 'tis not so.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	                  Prepare you, generals:	999
	The enemy comes on in gallant show;	999
	Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,	999
	And something to be done immediately.	999
	999
ANTONY	Octavius, lead your battle softly on,	999
	Upon the left hand of the even field.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.	999
	999
ANTONY	Why do you cross me in this exigent?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	I do not cross you; but I will do so.	999
	999
	[March]	999
	999
	[Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army;	999
	LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others]	999
	999
BRUTUS	They stand, and would have parley.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?	999
	999
ANTONY	No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.	999
	Make forth; the generals would have some words.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	Stir not until the signal.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	Not that we love words better, as you do.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.	999
	999
ANTONY	In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:	999
	Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,	999
	Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'	999
	999
CASSIUS	Antony,	999
	The posture of your blows are yet unknown;	999
	But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,	999
	And leave them honeyless.	999
	999
ANTONY	Not stingless too.	999
	999
BRUTUS	O, yes, and soundless too;	999
	For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,	999
	And very wisely threat before you sting.	999
	999
ANTONY	Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers	999
	Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:	999
	You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,	999
	And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;	999
	Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind	999
	Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!	999
	999
CASSIUS	Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:	999
	This tongue had not offended so to-day,	999
	If Cassius might have ruled.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,	999
	The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;	999
	I draw a sword against conspirators;	999
	When think you that the sword goes up again?	999
	Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds	999
	Be well avenged; or till another Caesar	999
	Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,	999
	Unless thou bring'st them with thee.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	So I hope;	999
	I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.	999
	999
BRUTUS	O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,	999
	Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.	999
	999
CASSIUS	A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,	999
	Join'd with a masker and a reveller!	999
	999
ANTONY	Old Cassius still!	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	                  Come, Antony, away!	999
	Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:	999
	If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;	999
	If not, when you have stomachs.	999
	999
	[Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army]	999
	999
CASSIUS	Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!	999
	The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.	999
	999
LUCILIUS	[Standing forth]	My lord?	999
	999
	[BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart]	999
	999
CASSIUS	Messala!	999
	999
MESSALA	[Standing forth]  What says my general?	999
	999
CASSIUS	Messala,	999
	This is my birth-day; as this very day	999
	Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:	999
	Be thou my witness that against my will,	999
	As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set	999
	Upon one battle all our liberties.	999
	You know that I held Epicurus strong	999
	And his opinion: now I change my mind,	999
	And partly credit things that do presage.	999
	Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign	999
	Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,	999
	Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;	999
	Who to Philippi here consorted us:	999
	This morning are they fled away and gone;	999
	And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,	999
	Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,	999
	As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem	999
	A canopy most fatal, under which	999
	Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.	999
	999
MESSALA	Believe not so.	999
	999
CASSIUS	                  I but believe it partly;	999
	For I am fresh of spirit and resolved	999
	To meet all perils very constantly.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Even so, Lucilius.	999
	999
CASSIUS	                  Now, most noble Brutus,	999
	The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,	999
	Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!	999
	But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,	999
	Let's reason with the worst that may befall.	999
	If we do lose this battle, then is this	999
	The very last time we shall speak together:	999
	What are you then determined to do?	999
	999
BRUTUS	Even by the rule of that philosophy	999
	By which I did blame Cato for the death	999
	Which he did give himself, I know not how,	999
	But I do find it cowardly and vile,	999
	For fear of what might fall, so to prevent	999
	The time of life: arming myself with patience	999
	To stay the providence of some high powers	999
	That govern us below.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Then, if we lose this battle,	999
	You are contented to be led in triumph	999
	Thorough the streets of Rome?	999
	999
BRUTUS	No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,	999
	That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;	999
	He bears too great a mind. But this same day	999
	Must end that work the ides of March begun;	999
	And whether we shall meet again I know not.	999
	Therefore our everlasting farewell take:	999
	For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!	999
	If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;	999
	If not, why then, this parting was well made.	999
	999
CASSIUS	For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!	999
	If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;	999
	If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know	999
	The end of this day's business ere it come!	999
	But it sufficeth that the day will end,	999
	And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!	999

CASSIUS	O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!	999
	Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:	999
	This ensign here of mine was turning back;	999
	I slew the coward, and did take it from him.	999
	999
TITINIUS	O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;	999
	Who, having some advantage on Octavius,	999
	Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,	999
	Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.	999
	999
	[Enter PINDARUS]	999
	999
PINDARUS	Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;	999
	Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord	999
	Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.	999
	999
CASSIUS	This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;	999
	Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?	999
	999
TITINIUS	They are, my lord.	999
	999
CASSIUS	                  Titinius, if thou lovest me,	999
	Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,	999
	Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,	999
	And here again; that I may rest assured	999
	Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.	999
	999
TITINIUS	I will be here again, even with a thought.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CASSIUS	Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;	999
	My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,	999
	And tell me what thou notest about the field.	999
	999
	[PINDARUS ascends the hill]	999
	999
	This day I breathed first: time is come round,	999
	And where I did begin, there shall I end;	999
	My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?	999
	999
PINDARUS	[Above]  O my lord!	999
	999
CASSIUS	What news?	999
	999
PINDARUS	[Above]  Titinius is enclosed round about	999
	With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;	999
	Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.	999
	Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.	999
	He's ta'en.	999
	999
	[Shout]	999
	999
	And, hark! they shout for joy.	999
	999
CASSIUS	Come down, behold no more.	999
	O, coward that I am, to live so long,	999
	To see my best friend ta'en before my face!	999
	999
	[PINDARUS descends]	999
	999
	Come hither, sirrah:	999
	In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;	999
	And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,	999
	That whatsoever I did bid thee do,	999
	Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;	999
	Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,	999
	That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.	999
	Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;	999
	And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,	999
	Guide thou the sword.	999
	999
	[PINDARUS stabs him]	999
	999
		Caesar, thou art revenged,	999
	Even with the sword that kill'd thee.	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
PINDARUS	So, I am free; yet would not so have been,	999
	Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,	999
	Far from this country Pindarus shall run,	999
	Where never Roman shall take note of him.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA]	999
	999
MESSALA	It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius	999
	Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,	999
	As Cassius' legions are by Antony.	999
	999
TITINIUS	These tidings will well comfort Cassius.	999
	999
MESSALA	Where did you leave him?	999
	999
TITINIUS	All disconsolate,	999
	With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.	999
	999
MESSALA	Is not that he that lies upon the ground?	999
	999
TITINIUS	He lies not like the living. O my heart!	999
	999
MESSALA	Is not that he?	999
	999
TITINIUS	                  No, this was he, Messala,	999
	But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,	999
	As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,	999
	So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;	999
	The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;	999
	Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!	999
	Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.	999
	999
MESSALA	Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.	999
	O hateful error, melancholy's child,	999
	Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men	999
	The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,	999
	Thou never comest unto a happy birth,	999
	But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!	999
	999
TITINIUS	What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?	999
	999
MESSALA	Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet	999
	The noble Brutus, thrusting this report	999
	Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;	999
	For piercing steel and darts envenomed	999
	Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus	999
	As tidings of this sight.	999
	999
TITINIUS	Hie you, Messala,	999
	And I will seek for Pindarus the while.	999
	999
	[Exit MESSALA]	999
	999
	Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?	999
	Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they	999
	Put on my brows this wreath of victory,	999
	And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?	999
	Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!	999
	But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;	999
	Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I	999
	Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,	999
	And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.	999
	By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part	999
	Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.	999
	999
	[Kills himself]	999

	[Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO,	999

BRUTUS	Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?	999
	999
MESSALA	Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Titinius' face is upward.	999
	999
CATO	He is slain.	999
	999
BRUTUS	O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!	999
	Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords	999
	In our own proper entrails.	999
	999
	[Low alarums]	999
	999
CATO	Brave Titinius!	999
	Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!	999
	999
BRUTUS	Are yet two Romans living such as these?	999
	The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!	999
	It is impossible that ever Rome	999
	Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears	999
	To this dead man than you shall see me pay.	999
	I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.	999
	Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:	999
	His funerals shall not be in our camp,	999
	Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;	999
	And come, young Cato; let us to the field.	999
	Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:	999
	'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night	999

	999
CATO	What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?	999
	I will proclaim my name about the field:	999
	I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!	999
	A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;	999
	I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!	999

	There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;	999
	999
	[Offering money]	999
	999
	Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.	999

LUCILIUS	Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:	999
	I dare assure thee that no enemy	999
	Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:	999
	The gods defend him from so great a shame!	999
	When you do find him, or alive or dead,	999
	He will be found like Brutus, like himself.	999
	999
ANTONY	This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,	999
	A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;	999
	Give him all kindness: I had rather have	999
	Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,	999

CLITUS	Now is that noble vessel full of grief,	999

VOLUMNIUS	What says my lord?	999

BRUTUS	                  Why, this, Volumnius:	999
	The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me	999
	Two several times by night; at Sardis once,	999
	And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:	999
	I know my hour is come.	999
	999
VOLUMNIUS	Not so, my lord.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.	999
	Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;	999
	Our enemies have beat us to the pit:	999
	999
	[Low alarums]	999
	999
	It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,	999
	Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,	999
	Thou know'st that we two went to school together:	999
	Even for that our love of old, I prithee,	999
	Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.	999
	999
VOLUMNIUS	That's not an office for a friend, my lord.	999
	999
	[Alarum still]	999
	999
CLITUS	Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.	999
	999
BRUTUS	Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.	999
	Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;	999
	Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,	999
	My heart doth joy that yet in all my life	999
	I found no man but he was true to me.	999
	I shall have glory by this losing day	999
	More than Octavius and Mark Antony	999
	By this vile conquest shall attain unto.	999
	So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue	999
	Hath almost ended his life's history:	999
	Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,	999
	That have but labour'd to attain this hour.	999
	999
	[Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!']	999
	999

	Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:	999
	Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,	999
	While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?	999
	999
STRATO	Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.	999

MESSALA	My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?	999
	999
STRATO	Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:	999
	The conquerors can but make a fire of him;	999
	For Brutus only overcame himself,	999
	And no man else hath honour by his death.	999
	999
LUCILIUS	So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,	999
	That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.	999
	Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?	999
	999
STRATO	Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	Do so, good Messala.	999
	999
MESSALA	How died my master, Strato?	999
	999
STRATO	I held the sword, and he did run on it.	999
	999
MESSALA	Octavius, then take him to follow thee,	999
	That did the latest service to my master.	999
	999
ANTONY	This was the noblest Roman of them all:	999
	All the conspirators save only he	999
	Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;	999
	He only, in a general honest thought	999
	And common good to all, made one of them.	999
	His life was gentle, and the elements	999
	So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up	999
	And say to all the world 'This was a man!'	999
	999
OCTAVIUS	According to his virtue let us use him,	999
	With all respect and rites of burial.	999
	Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,	999
	Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.	999
	So call the field to rest; and let's away,	999

KENT	Is not this your son, my lord?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have	999
	so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am	999
	brazed to it.	999
	999
KENT	I cannot conceive you.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon	999
	she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son	999
	for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.	999
	Do you smell a fault?	999
	999
KENT	I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it	999
	being so proper.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year	999
	elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:	999
	though this knave came something saucily into the	999
	world before he was sent for, yet was his mother	999
	fair; there was good sport at his making, and the	999
	whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this	999
	noble gentleman, Edmund?	999
	999
EDMUND	No, my lord.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my	999
	honourable friend.	999
	999
EDMUND	My services to your lordship.	999
	999
KENT	I must love you, and sue to know you better.	999
	999
EDMUND	Sir, I shall study deserving.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He hath been out nine years, and away he shall	999
	again. The king is coming.	999
	999
	[Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY,	999
	GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants]	999
	999
KING LEAR	Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I shall, my liege.	999
	999
	[Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND]	999
	999
KING LEAR	Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.	999
	Give me the map there. Know that we have divided	999
	In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent	999
	To shake all cares and business from our age;	999
	Conferring them on younger strengths, while we	999
	Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,	999
	And you, our no less loving son of Albany,	999
	We have this hour a constant will to publish	999
	Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife	999
	May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,	999
	Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,	999
	Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,	999
	And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--	999
	Since now we will divest us both of rule,	999
	Interest of territory, cares of state,--	999
	Which of you shall we say doth love us most?	999
	That we our largest bounty may extend	999
	Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,	999
	Our eldest-born, speak first.	999
	999
GONERIL	Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;	999
	Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;	999
	Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;	999
	No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;	999
	As much as child e'er loved, or father found;	999
	A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;	999
	Beyond all manner of so much I love you.	999
	999
CORDELIA	[Aside]  What shall Cordelia do?	999
	Love, and be silent.	999
	999
LEAR	Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,	999
	With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,	999
	With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,	999
	We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue	999
	Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,	999
	Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.	999
	999
REGAN	Sir, I am made	999
	Of the self-same metal that my sister is,	999
	And prize me at her worth. In my true heart	999
	I find she names my very deed of love;	999
	Only she comes too short: that I profess	999
	Myself an enemy to all other joys,	999
	Which the most precious square of sense possesses;	999
	And find I am alone felicitate	999
	In your dear highness' love.	999
	999
CORDELIA	[Aside]	Then poor Cordelia!	999
	And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's	999
	More richer than my tongue.	999
	999
KING LEAR	To thee and thine hereditary ever	999
	Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;	999
	No less in space, validity, and pleasure,	999
	Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,	999
	Although the last, not least; to whose young love	999
	The vines of France and milk of Burgundy	999
	Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw	999
	A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.	999
	999
CORDELIA	Nothing, my lord.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Nothing!	999
	999
CORDELIA	Nothing.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.	999
	999
CORDELIA	Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave	999
	My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty	999
	According to my bond; nor more nor less.	999
	999
KING LEAR	How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,	999
	Lest it may mar your fortunes.	999
	999
CORDELIA	Good my lord,	999
	You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I	999
	Return those duties back as are right fit,	999
	Obey you, love you, and most honour you.	999
	Why have my sisters husbands, if they say	999
	They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,	999
	That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry	999
	Half my love with him, half my care and duty:	999
	Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,	999
	To love my father all.	999
	999
KING LEAR	But goes thy heart with this?	999
	999
CORDELIA	Ay, good my lord.	999
	999
KING LEAR	So young, and so untender?	999
	999
CORDELIA	So young, my lord, and true.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:	999
	For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,	999
	The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;	999
	By all the operation of the orbs	999
	From whom we do exist, and cease to be;	999
	Here I disclaim all my paternal care,	999
	Propinquity and property of blood,	999
	And as a stranger to my heart and me	999
	Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,	999
	Or he that makes his generation messes	999
	To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom	999
	Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,	999
	As thou my sometime daughter.	999
	999
KENT	Good my liege,--	999
	999
KING LEAR	Peace, Kent!	999
	Come not between the dragon and his wrath.	999
	I loved her most, and thought to set my rest	999
	On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!	999
	So be my grave my peace, as here I give	999
	Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?	999
	Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,	999
	With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:	999
	Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.	999
	I do invest you jointly with my power,	999
	Pre-eminence, and all the large effects	999
	That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,	999
	With reservation of an hundred knights,	999
	By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode	999
	Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain	999
	The name, and all the additions to a king;	999
	The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,	999
	Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,	999
	This coronet part betwixt you.	999
	999
	[Giving the crown]	999
	999
KENT	Royal Lear,	999
	Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,	999
	Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,	999
	As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--	999
	999
KING LEAR	The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.	999
	999
KENT	Let it fall rather, though the fork invade	999
	The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,	999
	When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?	999
	Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,	999
	When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,	999
	When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;	999
	And, in thy best consideration, cheque	999
	This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,	999
	Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;	999
	Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound	999
	Reverbs no hollowness.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Kent, on thy life, no more.	999
	999
KENT	My life I never held but as a pawn	999
	To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,	999
	Thy safety being the motive.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Out of my sight!	999
	999
KENT	See better, Lear; and let me still remain	999
	The true blank of thine eye.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Now, by Apollo,--	999
	999
KENT	                  Now, by Apollo, king,	999
	Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.	999
	999
KING LEAR	O, vassal! miscreant!	999
	999
	[Laying his hand on his sword]	999
	999
	999
ALBANY	|	999
	|  Dear sir, forbear.	999
CORNWALL	|	999
	999
	999
KENT	Do:	999
	Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow	999
	Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;	999
	Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,	999
	I'll tell thee thou dost evil.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Hear me, recreant!	999
	On thine allegiance, hear me!	999
	Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,	999
	Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride	999
	To come between our sentence and our power,	999
	Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,	999
	Our potency made good, take thy reward.	999
	Five days we do allot thee, for provision	999
	To shield thee from diseases of the world;	999
	And on the sixth to turn thy hated back	999
	Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,	999
	Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,	999
	The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,	999
	This shall not be revoked.	999
	999
KENT	Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,	999
	Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.	999
	999
	[To CORDELIA]	999
	999
	The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,	999
	That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!	999
	999
	[To REGAN and GONERIL]	999
	999
	And your large speeches may your deeds approve,	999
	That good effects may spring from words of love.	999
	Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;	999
	He'll shape his old course in a country new.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE,	999
	BURGUNDY, and Attendants]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.	999
	999
KING LEAR	My lord of Burgundy.	999
	We first address towards you, who with this king	999
	Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,	999
	Will you require in present dower with her,	999
	Or cease your quest of love?	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Most royal majesty,	999
	I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,	999
	Nor will you tender less.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Right noble Burgundy,	999
	When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;	999
	But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:	999
	If aught within that little seeming substance,	999
	Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,	999
	And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,	999
	She's there, and she is yours.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	I know no answer.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Will you, with those infirmities she owes,	999
	Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,	999
	Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,	999
	Take her, or leave her?	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Pardon me, royal sir;	999
	Election makes not up on such conditions.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,	999
	I tell you all her wealth.	999
	999
	[To KING OF FRANCE]	999
	999
		     For you, great king,	999
	I would not from your love make such a stray,	999
	To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you	999
	To avert your liking a more worthier way	999
	Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed	999
	Almost to acknowledge hers.	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	This is most strange,	999
	That she, that even but now was your best object,	999
	The argument of your praise, balm of your age,	999
	Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time	999
	Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle	999
	So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence	999
	Must be of such unnatural degree,	999
	That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection	999
	Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,	999
	Must be a faith that reason without miracle	999
	Could never plant in me.	999
	999
CORDELIA	I yet beseech your majesty,--	999
	If for I want that glib and oily art,	999
	To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,	999
	I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known	999
	It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,	999
	No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,	999
	That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;	999
	But even for want of that for which I am richer,	999
	A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue	999
	As I am glad I have not, though not to have it	999
	Hath lost me in your liking.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Better thou	999
	Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature	999
	Which often leaves the history unspoke	999
	That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,	999
	What say you to the lady? Love's not love	999
	When it is mingled with regards that stand	999
	Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?	999
	She is herself a dowry.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Royal Lear,	999
	Give but that portion which yourself proposed,	999
	And here I take Cordelia by the hand,	999
	Duchess of Burgundy.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father	999
	That you must lose a husband.	999
	999
CORDELIA	Peace be with Burgundy!	999
	Since that respects of fortune are his love,	999
	I shall not be his wife.	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;	999
	Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!	999
	Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:	999
	Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.	999
	Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect	999
	My love should kindle to inflamed respect.	999
	Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,	999
	Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:	999
	Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy	999
	Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.	999
	Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:	999
	Thou losest here, a better where to find.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we	999
	Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see	999
	That face of hers again. Therefore be gone	999
	Without our grace, our love, our benison.	999
	Come, noble Burgundy.	999
	999
	[Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL,	999
	REGAN, and CORDELIA]	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	Bid farewell to your sisters.	999
	999
CORDELIA	The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes	999
	Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;	999
	And like a sister am most loath to call	999
	Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:	999
	To your professed bosoms I commit him	999
	But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,	999
	I would prefer him to a better place.	999
	So, farewell to you both.	999
	999
REGAN	Prescribe not us our duties.	999
	999
GONERIL	Let your study	999
	Be to content your lord, who hath received you	999
	At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,	999
	And well are worth the want that you have wanted.	999
	999
CORDELIA	Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:	999
	Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.	999
	Well may you prosper!	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	Come, my fair Cordelia.	999
	999
	[Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA]	999
	999
GONERIL	Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what	999
	most nearly appertains to us both. I think our	999
	father will hence to-night.	999
	999
REGAN	That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.	999
	999
GONERIL	You see how full of changes his age is; the	999
	observation we have made of it hath not been	999
	little: he always loved our sister most; and	999
	with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off	999
	appears too grossly.	999
	999
REGAN	'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever	999
	but slenderly known himself.	999
	999
GONERIL	The best and soundest of his time hath been but	999
	rash; then must we look to receive from his age,	999
	not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed	999
	condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness	999
	that infirm and choleric years bring with them.	999
	999
REGAN	Such unconstant starts are we like to have from	999
	him as this of Kent's banishment.	999
	999
GONERIL	There is further compliment of leavetaking	999
	between France and him. Pray you, let's hit	999
	together: if our father carry authority with	999
	such dispositions as he bears, this last	999
	surrender of his will but offend us.	999
	999
REGAN	We shall further think on't.	999
	999
GONERIL	We must do something, and i' the heat.	999

SCENE II	The Earl of Gloucester's castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter EDMUND, with a letter]	999
	999
EDMUND	Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law	999
	My services are bound. Wherefore should I	999
	Stand in the plague of custom, and permit	999
	The curiosity of nations to deprive me,	999
	For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines	999
	Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?	999
	When my dimensions are as well compact,	999
	My mind as generous, and my shape as true,	999
	As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us	999
	With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?	999
	Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take	999
	More composition and fierce quality	999
	Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,	999
	Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,	999
	Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,	999
	Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:	999
	Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund	999
	As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!	999
	Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,	999
	And my invention thrive, Edmund the base	999
	Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:	999
	Now, gods, stand up for bastards!	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!	999
	And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!	999
	Confined to exhibition! All this done	999
	Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?	999
	999
EDMUND	So please your lordship, none.	999
	999
	[Putting up the letter]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?	999
	999
EDMUND	I know no news, my lord.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What paper were you reading?	999
	999
EDMUND	Nothing, my lord.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of	999
	it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath	999
	not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,	999
	if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.	999
	999
EDMUND	I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter	999
	from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;	999
	and for so much as I have perused, I find it not	999
	fit for your o'er-looking.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Give me the letter, sir.	999
	999
EDMUND	I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The	999
	contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Let's see, let's see.	999
	999
EDMUND	I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote	999
	this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Reads]  'This policy and reverence of age makes	999
	the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps	999
	our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish	999
	them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage	999
	in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not	999
	as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to	999
	me, that of this I may speak more. If our father	999
	would sleep till I waked him, you should half his	999
	revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your	999
	brother,	EDGAR.'	999
	999
	Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you	999
	should enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!	999
	Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain	999
	to breed it in?--When came this to you? who	999
	brought it?	999
	999
EDMUND	It was not brought me, my lord; there's the	999
	cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the	999
	casement of my closet.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	You know the character to be your brother's?	999
	999
EDMUND	If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear	999
	it were his; but, in respect of that, I would	999
	fain think it were not.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	It is his.	999
	999
EDMUND	It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is	999
	not in the contents.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?	999
	999
EDMUND	Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft	999
	maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,	999
	and fathers declining, the father should be as	999
	ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	O villain, villain! His very opinion in the	999
	letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,	999
	brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,	999
	seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!	999
	Where is he?	999
	999
EDMUND	I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please	999
	you to suspend your indignation against my	999
	brother till you can derive from him better	999
	testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain	999
	course; where, if you violently proceed against	999
	him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great	999
	gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the	999
	heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life	999
	for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my	999
	affection to your honour, and to no further	999
	pretence of danger.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Think you so?	999
	999
EDMUND	If your honour judge it meet, I will place you	999
	where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an	999
	auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and	999
	that without any further delay than this very evening.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He cannot be such a monster--	999
	999
EDMUND	Nor is not, sure.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	To his father, that so tenderly and entirely	999
	loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him	999
	out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the	999
	business after your own wisdom. I would unstate	999
	myself, to be in a due resolution.	999
	999
EDMUND	I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the	999
	business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend	999
	no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can	999
	reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself	999
	scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,	999
	friendship falls off, brothers divide: in	999
	cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in	999
	palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son	999
	and father. This villain of mine comes under the	999
	prediction; there's son against father: the king	999
	falls from bias of nature; there's father against	999
	child. We have seen the best of our time:	999
	machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all	999
	ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our	999
	graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall	999
	lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the	999
	noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his	999
	offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
EDMUND	This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,	999
	when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit	999
	of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our	999
	disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as	999
	if we were villains by necessity; fools by	999
	heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and	999
	treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,	999
	liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of	999
	planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,	999
	by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion	999
	of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish	999
	disposition to the charge of a star! My	999
	father compounded with my mother under the	999
	dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa	999
	major; so that it follows, I am rough and	999
	lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,	999
	had the maidenliest star in the firmament	999
	twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--	999
	999
	[Enter EDGAR]	999
	999
	And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old	999
	comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a	999
	sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do	999
	portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.	999
	999
EDGAR	How now, brother Edmund! what serious	999
	contemplation are you in?	999
	999
EDMUND	I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read	999
	this other day, what should follow these eclipses.	999
	999
EDGAR	Do you busy yourself about that?	999
	999
EDMUND	I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed	999
	unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child	999
	and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of	999
	ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and	999
	maledictions against king and nobles; needless	999
	diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation	999
	of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.	999
	999
EDGAR	How long have you been a sectary astronomical?	999
	999
EDMUND	Come, come; when saw you my father last?	999
	999
EDGAR	Why, the night gone by.	999
	999
EDMUND	Spake you with him?	999
	999
EDGAR	Ay, two hours together.	999
	999
EDMUND	Parted you in good terms? Found you no	999
	displeasure in him by word or countenance?	999
	999
EDGAR	None at all.	999
	999
EDMUND	Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended	999
	him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence	999
	till some little time hath qualified the heat of	999
	his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth	999
	in him, that with the mischief of your person it	999
	would scarcely allay.	999
	999
EDGAR	Some villain hath done me wrong.	999
	999
EDMUND	That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent	999
	forbearance till the spied of his rage goes	999
	slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my	999
	lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to	999
	hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:	999
	if you do stir abroad, go armed.	999
	999
EDGAR	Armed, brother!	999
	999
EDMUND	Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: I	999
	am no honest man if there be any good meaning	999
	towards you: I have told you what I have seen	999
	and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image	999
	and horror of it: pray you, away.	999
	999
EDGAR	Shall I hear from you anon?	999
	999
EDMUND	I do serve you in this business.	999
	999
	[Exit EDGAR]	999
	999
	A credulous father! and a brother noble,	999
	Whose nature is so far from doing harms,	999
	That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty	999
	My practises ride easy! I see the business.	999
	Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:	999
	All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.	999

SCENE III	The Duke of Albany's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward]	999
	999
GONERIL	Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?	999
	999
OSWALD	Yes, madam.	999
	999
GONERIL	By day and night he wrongs me; every hour	999
	He flashes into one gross crime or other,	999
	That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:	999
	His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us	999
	On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,	999
	I will not speak with him; say I am sick:	999
	If you come slack of former services,	999
	You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.	999
	999
OSWALD	He's coming, madam; I hear him.	999
	999
	[Horns within]	999
	999
GONERIL	Put on what weary negligence you please,	999
	You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:	999
	If he dislike it, let him to our sister,	999
	Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,	999
	Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,	999
	That still would manage those authorities	999
	That he hath given away! Now, by my life,	999
	Old fools are babes again; and must be used	999
	With cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.	999
	Remember what I tell you.	999
	999
OSWALD	Well, madam.	999
	999
GONERIL	And let his knights have colder looks among you;	999
	What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:	999
	I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,	999
	That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,	999
	To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.	999

ACT I	999

	999
	999
SCENE IV	A hall in the same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KENT, disguised]	999
	999
KENT	If but as well I other accents borrow,	999
	That can my speech defuse, my good intent	999
	May carry through itself to that full issue	999
	For which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,	999
	If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,	999
	So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,	999
	Shall find thee full of labours.	999
	999
	[Horns within. Enter KING LEAR, Knights, and	999
	Attendants]	999
	999
KING LEAR	Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.	999
	999
	[Exit an Attendant]	999
	999
	How now! what art thou?	999
	999
KENT	A man, sir.	999
	999
KING LEAR	What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?	999
	999
KENT	I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve	999
	him truly that will put me in trust: to love him	999
	that is honest; to converse with him that is wise,	999
	and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when I	999
	cannot choose; and to eat no fish.	999
	999
KING LEAR	What art thou?	999
	999
KENT	A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.	999
	999
KING LEAR	If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a	999
	king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?	999
	999
KENT	Service.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Who wouldst thou serve?	999
	999
KENT	You.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Dost thou know me, fellow?	999
	999
KENT	No, sir; but you have that in your countenance	999
	which I would fain call master.	999
	999
KING LEAR	What's that?	999
	999
KENT	Authority.	999
	999
KING LEAR	What services canst thou do?	999
	999
KENT	I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious	999
	tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message	999
	bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am	999
	qualified in; and the best of me is diligence.	999
	999
KING LEAR	How old art thou?	999
	999
KENT	Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor	999
	so old to dote on her for any thing: I have years	999
	on my back forty eight.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Follow me; thou shalt serve me: if I like thee no	999
	worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.	999
	Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool?	999
	Go you, and call my fool hither.	999
	999
	[Exit an Attendant]	999
	999
	[Enter OSWALD]	999
	999
	You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?	999
	999
OSWALD	So please you,--	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING LEAR	What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.	999
	999
	[Exit a Knight]	999
	999
	Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Knight]	999
	999
	How now! where's that mongrel?	999
	999
Knight	He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.	999
	999
Knight	Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would	999
	not.	999
	999
KING LEAR	He would not!	999
	999
Knight	My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to my	999
	judgment, your highness is not entertained with that	999
	ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a	999
	great abatement of kindness appears as well in the	999
	general dependants as in the duke himself also and	999
	your daughter.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Ha! sayest thou so?	999
	999
Knight	I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken;	999
	for my duty cannot be silent when I think your	999
	highness wronged.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I	999
	have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I	999
	have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity	999
	than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness:	999
	I will look further into't. But where's my fool? I	999
	have not seen him this two days.	999
	999
Knight	Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the	999
	fool hath much pined away.	999
	999
KING LEAR	No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you, and	999
	tell my daughter I would speak with her.	999
	999
	[Exit an Attendant]	999
	999
	Go you, call hither my fool.	999
	999
	[Exit an Attendant]	999
	999
	[Re-enter OSWALD]	999
	999
	O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I,	999
	sir?	999
	999
OSWALD	My lady's father.	999
	999
KING LEAR	'My lady's father'! my lord's knave: your	999
	whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!	999
	999
OSWALD	I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?	999
	999
	[Striking him]	999
	999
OSWALD	I'll not be struck, my lord.	999
	999
KENT	Nor tripped neither, you base football player.	999
	999
	[Tripping up his heels]	999
	999
KING LEAR	I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'll	999
	love thee.	999
	999
KENT	Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences:	999
	away, away! if you will measure your lubber's	999
	length again, tarry: but away! go to; have you	999
	wisdom? so.	999
	999
	[Pushes OSWALD out]	999
	999
KING LEAR	Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's	999
	earnest of thy service.	999
	999
	[Giving KENT money]	999
	999
	[Enter Fool]	999
	999
Fool	Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.	999
	999
	[Offering KENT his cap]	999
	999
KING LEAR	How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?	999
	999
Fool	Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.	999
	999
KENT	Why, fool?	999
	999
Fool	Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour:	999
	nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,	999
	thou'lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb:	999
	why, this fellow has banished two on's daughters,	999
	and did the third a blessing against his will; if	999
	thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.	999
	How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!	999
	999
KING LEAR	Why, my boy?	999
	999
Fool	If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs	999
	myself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Take heed, sirrah; the whip.	999
	999
Fool	Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped	999
	out, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.	999
	999
KING LEAR	A pestilent gall to me!	999
	999
Fool	Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Do.	999
	999
Fool	Mark it, nuncle:	999
	Have more than thou showest,	999
	Speak less than thou knowest,	999
	Lend less than thou owest,	999
	Ride more than thou goest,	999
	Learn more than thou trowest,	999
	Set less than thou throwest;	999
	Leave thy drink and thy whore,	999
	And keep in-a-door,	999
	And thou shalt have more	999
	Than two tens to a score.	999
	999
KENT	This is nothing, fool.	999
	999
Fool	Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer; you	999
	gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of	999
	nothing, nuncle?	999
	999
KING LEAR	Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.	999
	999
Fool	[To KENT]  Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of	999
	his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.	999
	999
KING LEAR	A bitter fool!	999
	999
Fool	Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a	999
	bitter fool and a sweet fool?	999
	999
KING LEAR	No, lad; teach me.	999
	999
Fool	That lord that counsell'd thee	999
	To give away thy land,	999
	Come place him here by me,	999
	Do thou for him stand:	999
	The sweet and bitter fool	999
	Will presently appear;	999
	The one in motley here,	999
	The other found out there.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Dost thou call me fool, boy?	999
	999
Fool	All thy other titles thou hast given away; that	999
	thou wast born with.	999
	999
KENT	This is not altogether fool, my lord.	999
	999
Fool	No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if	999
	I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:	999
	and ladies too, they will not let me have all fool	999
	to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,	999
	nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.	999
	999
KING LEAR	What two crowns shall they be?	999
	999
Fool	Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eat	999
	up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou	999
	clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away	999
	both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er	999
	the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,	999
	when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak	999
	like myself in this, let him be whipped that first	999
	finds it so.	999
	999
	[Singing]	999
	999
	Fools had ne'er less wit in a year;	999
	For wise men are grown foppish,	999
	They know not how their wits to wear,	999
	Their manners are so apish.	999
	999
KING LEAR	When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?	999
	999
Fool	I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy	999
	daughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest them	999
	the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,	999
	999
	[Singing]	999
	999
	Then they for sudden joy did weep,	999
	And I for sorrow sung,	999
	That such a king should play bo-peep,	999
	And go the fools among.	999
	999
	Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach	999
	thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.	999
	999
KING LEAR	An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.	999
	999
Fool	I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:	999
	they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt	999
	have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am	999
	whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any	999
	kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be	999
	thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,	999
	and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o'	999
	the parings.	999
	999
	[Enter GONERIL]	999
	999
KING LEAR	How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?	999
	Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.	999
	999
Fool	Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to	999
	care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a	999
	figure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool,	999
	thou art nothing.	999
	999
	[To GONERIL]	999
	999
	Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face	999
	bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,	999
	He that keeps nor crust nor crum,	999
	Weary of all, shall want some.	999
	999
	[Pointing to KING LEAR]	999
	999
	That's a shealed peascod.	999
	999
GONERIL	Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,	999
	But other of your insolent retinue	999
	Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth	999
	In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,	999
	I had thought, by making this well known unto you,	999
	To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,	999
	By what yourself too late have spoke and done.	999
	That you protect this course, and put it on	999
	By your allowance; which if you should, the fault	999
	Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,	999
	Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,	999
	Might in their working do you that offence,	999
	Which else were shame, that then necessity	999
	Will call discreet proceeding.	999
	999
Fool	For, you trow, nuncle,	999
	The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,	999
	That it's had it head bit off by it young.	999
	So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Are you our daughter?	999
	999
GONERIL	Come, sir,	999
	I would you would make use of that good wisdom,	999
	Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away	999
	These dispositions, that of late transform you	999
	From what you rightly are.	999
	999
Fool	May not an ass know when the cart	999
	draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:	999
	Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?	999
	Either his notion weakens, his discernings	999
	Are lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.	999
	Who is it that can tell me who I am?	999
	999
Fool	Lear's shadow.	999
	999
KING LEAR	I would learn that; for, by the	999
	marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,	999
	I should be false persuaded I had daughters.	999
	999
Fool	Which they will make an obedient father.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Your name, fair gentlewoman?	999
	999
GONERIL	This admiration, sir, is much o' the savour	999
	Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you	999
	To understand my purposes aright:	999
	As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.	999
	Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;	999
	Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,	999
	That this our court, infected with their manners,	999
	Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust	999
	Make it more like a tavern or a brothel	999
	Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak	999
	For instant remedy: be then desired	999
	By her, that else will take the thing she begs,	999
	A little to disquantity your train;	999
	And the remainder, that shall still depend,	999
	To be such men as may besort your age,	999
	And know themselves and you.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Darkness and devils!	999
	Saddle my horses; call my train together:	999
	Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.	999
	Yet have I left a daughter.	999
	999
GONERIL	You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble	999
	Make servants of their betters.	999
	999
	[Enter ALBANY]	999
	999
KING LEAR	Woe, that too late repents,--	999
	999
	[To ALBANY]	999
	999
		        O, sir, are you come?	999
	Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.	999
	Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,	999
	More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child	999
	Than the sea-monster!	999
	999
ALBANY	Pray, sir, be patient.	999
	999
KING LEAR	[To GONERIL]  Detested kite! thou liest.	999
	My train are men of choice and rarest parts,	999
	That all particulars of duty know,	999
	And in the most exact regard support	999
	The worships of their name. O most small fault,	999
	How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!	999
	That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature	999
	From the fix'd place; drew from heart all love,	999
	And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!	999
	Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,	999
	999
	[Striking his head]	999
	999
	And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.	999
	999
ALBANY	My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant	999
	Of what hath moved you.	999
	999
KING LEAR	It may be so, my lord.	999
	Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!	999
	Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend	999
	To make this creature fruitful!	999
	Into her womb convey sterility!	999
	Dry up in her the organs of increase;	999
	And from her derogate body never spring	999
	A babe to honour her! If she must teem,	999
	Create her child of spleen; that it may live,	999
	And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!	999
	Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;	999
	With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;	999
	Turn all her mother's pains and benefits	999
	To laughter and contempt; that she may feel	999
	How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is	999
	To have a thankless child! Away, away!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ALBANY	Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?	999
	999
GONERIL	Never afflict yourself to know the cause;	999
	But let his disposition have that scope	999
	That dotage gives it.	999
	999
	[Re-enter KING LEAR]	999
	999
KING LEAR	What, fifty of my followers at a clap!	999
	Within a fortnight!	999
	999
ALBANY	What's the matter, sir?	999
	999
	999
KING LEAR	I'll tell thee:	999
	999
	[To GONERIL]	999
	999
	Life and death! I am ashamed	999
	That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;	999
	That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,	999
	Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!	999
	The untented woundings of a father's curse	999
	Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,	999
	Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,	999
	And cast you, with the waters that you lose,	999
	To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?	999
	Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,	999
	Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:	999
	When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails	999
	She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find	999
	That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think	999
	I have cast off for ever: thou shalt,	999
	I warrant thee.	999
	999
	[Exeunt KING LEAR, KENT, and Attendants]	999
	999
GONERIL	Do you mark that, my lord?	999
	999
ALBANY	I cannot be so partial, Goneril,	999
	To the great love I bear you,--	999
	999
GONERIL	Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!	999
	999
	[To the Fool]	999
	999
	You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.	999
	999
Fool	Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool	999
	with thee.	999
	A fox, when one has caught her,	999
	And such a daughter,	999
	Should sure to the slaughter,	999
	If my cap would buy a halter:	999
	So the fool follows after.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
GONERIL	This man hath had good counsel:--a hundred knights!	999
	'Tis politic and safe to let him keep	999
	At point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,	999
	Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,	999
	He may enguard his dotage with their powers,	999
	And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!	999
	999
ALBANY	Well, you may fear too far.	999
	999
GONERIL	Safer than trust too far:	999
	Let me still take away the harms I fear,	999
	Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.	999
	What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister	999
	If she sustain him and his hundred knights	999
	When I have show'd the unfitness,--	999
	999
	[Re-enter OSWALD]	999
	999
		                  How now, Oswald!	999
	What, have you writ that letter to my sister?	999
	999
OSWALD	Yes, madam.	999
	999
GONERIL	Take you some company, and away to horse:	999
	Inform her full of my particular fear;	999
	And thereto add such reasons of your own	999
	As may compact it more. Get you gone;	999
	And hasten your return.	999
	999
	[Exit OSWALD]	999
	999
		  No, no, my lord,	999
	This milky gentleness and course of yours	999
	Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,	999
	You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom	999
	Than praised for harmful mildness.	999
	999
ALBANY	How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:	999
	Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.	999
	999
GONERIL	Nay, then--	999
	999

	999
KING LEAR	Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.	999
	Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you	999
	know than comes from her demand out of the letter.	999
	If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.	999

KENT	I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered	999
	your letter.	999

	999
Fool	If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in	999
	danger of kibes?	999
	999
KING LEAR	Ay, boy.	999
	999
Fool	Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er go	999
	slip-shod.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Ha, ha, ha!	999
	999
Fool	Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;	999
	for though she's as like this as a crab's like an	999
	apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?	999
	999
Fool	She will taste as like this as a crab does to a	999
	crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'	999
	the middle on's face?	999
	999
KING LEAR	No.	999
	999
Fool	Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; that	999
	what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.	999
	999
KING LEAR	I did her wrong--	999
	999
Fool	Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?	999
	999
KING LEAR	No.	999
	999
Fool	Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Why?	999
	999
Fool	Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his	999
	daughters, and leave his horns without a case.	999
	999
KING LEAR	I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my	999
	horses ready?	999
	999
Fool	Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the	999
	seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Because they are not eight?	999
	999
Fool	Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.	999
	999
KING LEAR	To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!	999
	999
Fool	If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten	999
	for being old before thy time.	999
	999
KING LEAR	How's that?	999
	999
Fool	Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst	999
	been wise.	999
	999
KING LEAR	O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven	999
	Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!	999

	[Enter Gentleman]	999

Gentleman	Ready, my lord.	999

	999
	[Enter EDMUND, and CURAN meets him]	999
	999
EDMUND	Save thee, Curan.	999
	999
CURAN	And you, sir. I have been with your father, and	999
	given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan	999
	his duchess will be here with him this night.	999
	999
EDMUND	How comes that?	999
	999
CURAN	Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;	999
	I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but	999
	ear-kissing arguments?	999
	999
EDMUND	Not I	pray you, what are they?	999
	999
CURAN	Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the	999
	Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?	999
	999
EDMUND	Not a word.	999
	999
CURAN	You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
EDMUND	The duke be here to-night? The better! best!	999
	This weaves itself perforce into my business.	999
	My father hath set guard to take my brother;	999
	And I have one thing, of a queasy question,	999
	Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!	999
	Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!	999
	999
	[Enter EDGAR]	999
	999
	My father watches: O sir, fly this place;	999
	Intelligence is given where you are hid;	999
	You have now the good advantage of the night:	999
	Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?	999
	He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,	999
	And Regan with him: have you nothing said	999
	Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?	999
	Advise yourself.	999
	999
EDGAR	                  I am sure on't, not a word.	999
	999
EDMUND	I hear my father coming: pardon me:	999
	In cunning I must draw my sword upon you	999
	Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.	999
	Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!	999
	Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit EDGAR]	999
	999
	Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.	999
	999
	[Wounds his arm]	999
	999
	Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards	999
	Do more than this in sport. Father, father!	999
	Stop, stop! No help?	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Now, Edmund, where's the villain?	999
	999
EDMUND	Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,	999
	Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon	999
	To stand auspicious mistress,--	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	But where is he?	999
	999
EDMUND	Look, sir, I bleed.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Where is the villain, Edmund?	999
	999
EDMUND	Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Pursue him, ho! Go after.	999
	999
	[Exeunt some Servants]	999
	999
		     By no means what?	999
	999
EDMUND	Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;	999
	But that I told him, the revenging gods	999
	'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;	999
	Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond	999
	The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,	999
	Seeing how loathly opposite I stood	999
	To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,	999
	With his prepared sword, he charges home	999
	My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:	999
	But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,	999
	Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,	999
	Or whether gasted by the noise I made,	999
	Full suddenly he fled.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Let him fly far:	999
	Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;	999
	And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,	999
	My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:	999
	By his authority I will proclaim it,	999
	That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,	999
	Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;	999
	He that conceals him, death.	999
	999
EDMUND	When I dissuaded him from his intent,	999
	And found him pight to do it, with curst speech	999
	I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,	999
	'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,	999
	If I would stand against thee, would the reposal	999
	Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee	999
	Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--	999
	As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce	999
	My very character,--I'ld turn it all	999
	To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:	999
	And thou must make a dullard of the world,	999
	If they not thought the profits of my death	999
	Were very pregnant and potential spurs	999
	To make thee seek it.'	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Strong and fasten'd villain	999
	Would he deny his letter? I never got him.	999
	999
	[Tucket within]	999
	999
	Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.	999
	All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;	999
	The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture	999
	I will send far and near, that all the kingdom	999
	May have the due note of him; and of my land,	999
	Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means	999
	To make thee capable.	999
	999
	[Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants]	999
	999
CORNWALL	How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,	999
	Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.	999
	999
REGAN	If it be true, all vengeance comes too short	999
	Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!	999
	999
REGAN	What, did my father's godson seek your life?	999
	He whom my father named? your Edgar?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!	999
	999
REGAN	Was he not companion with the riotous knights	999
	That tend upon my father?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.	999
	999
EDMUND	Yes, madam, he was of that consort.	999
	999
REGAN	No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:	999
	'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,	999
	To have the expense and waste of his revenues.	999
	I have this present evening from my sister	999
	Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,	999
	That if they come to sojourn at my house,	999
	I'll not be there.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Nor I, assure thee, Regan.	999
	Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father	999
	A child-like office.	999
	999
EDMUND	'Twas my duty, sir.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He did bewray his practise; and received	999
	This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Is he pursued?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	                  Ay, my good lord.	999
	999
CORNWALL	If he be taken, he shall never more	999
	Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,	999
	How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,	999
	Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant	999
	So much commend itself, you shall be ours:	999
	Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;	999
	You we first seize on.	999
	999
EDMUND	I shall serve you, sir,	999
	Truly, however else.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	For him I thank your grace.	999
	999
CORNWALL	You know not why we came to visit you,--	999
	999
REGAN	Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:	999
	Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,	999
	Wherein we must have use of your advice:	999
	Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,	999
	Of differences, which I least thought it fit	999
	To answer from our home; the several messengers	999
	From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,	999
	Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow	999
	Your needful counsel to our business,	999
	Which craves the instant use.	999

OSWALD	Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.	999
	999
KENT	I love thee not.	999
	999
OSWALD	Why, then, I care not for thee.	999
	999
KENT	If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee	999
	care for me.	999
	999
OSWALD	Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.	999
	999
KENT	Fellow, I know thee.	999
	999
OSWALD	What dost thou know me for?	999
	999
KENT	A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a	999
	base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,	999
	hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a	999
	lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,	999
	glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;	999
	one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a	999
	bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but	999
	the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,	999
	and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I	999
	will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest	999
	the least syllable of thy addition.	999
	999
OSWALD	Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail	999
	on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!	999
	999
KENT	What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou	999
	knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up	999
	thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you	999
	rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon	999
	shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:	999
	draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.	999
	999
	[Drawing his sword]	999
	999
OSWALD	Away! I have nothing to do with thee.	999
	999
KENT	Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the	999
	king; and take vanity the puppet's part against the	999
	royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so	999
	carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.	999
	999
OSWALD	Help, ho! murder! help!	999
	999
KENT	Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat	999
	slave, strike.	999
	999
	[Beating him]	999
	999
OSWALD	Help, ho! murder! murder!	999
	999
	[Enter EDMUND, with his rapier drawn, CORNWALL,	999
	REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants]	999
	999
EDMUND	How now! What's the matter?	999
	999
KENT	With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll	999
	flesh ye; come on, young master.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Weapons! arms! What 's the matter here?	999
	999
CORNWALL	Keep peace, upon your lives:	999
	He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?	999
	999
REGAN	The messengers from our sister and the king.	999
	999
CORNWALL	What is your difference? speak.	999
	999
OSWALD	I am scarce in breath, my lord.	999
	999
KENT	No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You	999
	cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a	999
	tailor made thee.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?	999
	999
KENT	Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could	999
	not have made him so ill, though he had been but two	999
	hours at the trade.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?	999
	999
OSWALD	This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared	999
	at suit of his gray beard,--	999
	999
KENT	Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My	999
	lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this	999
	unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of	999
	a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?	999
	999
CORNWALL	Peace, sirrah!	999
	You beastly knave, know you no reverence?	999
	999
KENT	Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Why art thou angry?	999
	999
KENT	That such a slave as this should wear a sword,	999
	Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,	999
	Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain	999
	Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion	999
	That in the natures of their lords rebel;	999
	Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;	999
	Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks	999
	With every gale and vary of their masters,	999
	Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.	999
	A plague upon your epileptic visage!	999
	Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?	999
	Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,	999
	I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Why, art thou mad, old fellow?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	How fell you out? say that.	999
	999
KENT	No contraries hold more antipathy	999
	Than I and such a knave.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Why dost thou call him a knave?  What's his offence?	999
	999
KENT	His countenance likes me not.	999
	999
CORNWALL	No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.	999
	999
KENT	Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:	999
	I have seen better faces in my time	999
	Than stands on any shoulder that I see	999
	Before me at this instant.	999
	999
CORNWALL	This is some fellow,	999
	Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect	999
	A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb	999
	Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,	999
	An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!	999
	An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.	999
	These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness	999
	Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends	999
	Than twenty silly ducking observants	999
	That stretch their duties nicely.	999
	999
KENT	Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,	999
	Under the allowance of your great aspect,	999
	Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire	999
	On flickering Phoebus' front,--	999
	999
CORNWALL	What mean'st by this?	999
	999
KENT	To go out of my dialect, which you	999
	discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no	999
	flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain	999
	accent was a plain knave; which for my part	999
	I will not be, though I should win your displeasure	999
	to entreat me to 't.	999
	999
CORNWALL	What was the offence you gave him?	999
	999
OSWALD	I never gave him any:	999
	It pleased the king his master very late	999
	To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;	999
	When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,	999
	Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,	999
	And put upon him such a deal of man,	999
	That worthied him, got praises of the king	999
	For him attempting who was self-subdued;	999
	And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,	999
	Drew on me here again.	999
	999
KENT	None of these rogues and cowards	999
	But Ajax is their fool.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Fetch forth the stocks!	999
	You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,	999
	We'll teach you--	999
	999
KENT	                  Sir, I am too old to learn:	999
	Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;	999
	On whose employment I was sent to you:	999
	You shall do small respect, show too bold malice	999
	Against the grace and person of my master,	999
	Stocking his messenger.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,	999
	There shall he sit till noon.	999
	999
REGAN	Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.	999
	999
KENT	Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,	999
	You should not use me so.	999
	999
REGAN	Sir, being his knave, I will.	999
	999
CORNWALL	This is a fellow of the self-same colour	999
	Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!	999
	999
	[Stocks brought out]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Let me beseech your grace not to do so:	999
	His fault is much, and the good king his master	999
	Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction	999
	Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches	999
	For pilferings and most common trespasses	999
	Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,	999
	That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,	999
	Should have him thus restrain'd.	999
	999
CORNWALL	I'll answer that.	999
	999
REGAN	My sister may receive it much more worse,	999
	To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,	999
	For following her affairs. Put in his legs.	999
	999
	[KENT is put in the stocks]	999
	999
	Come, my good lord, away.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,	999
	Whose disposition, all the world well knows,	999
	Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.	999
	999
KENT	Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;	999
	Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.	999
	A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:	999
	Give you good morrow!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KENT	Good king, that must approve the common saw,	999
	Thou out of heaven's benediction comest	999
	To the warm sun!	999
	Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,	999
	That by thy comfortable beams I may	999
	Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles	999
	But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,	999
	Who hath most fortunately been inform'd	999
	Of my obscured course; and shall find time	999
	From this enormous state, seeking to give	999
	Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,	999
	Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold	999
	This shameful lodging.	999
	Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!	999

	[Enter EDGAR]	999
	999
EDGAR	I heard myself proclaim'd;	999
	And by the happy hollow of a tree	999
	Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,	999
	That guard, and most unusual vigilance,	999
	Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,	999
	I will preserve myself: and am bethought	999
	To take the basest and most poorest shape	999
	That ever penury, in contempt of man,	999
	Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;	999
	Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;	999
	And with presented nakedness out-face	999
	The winds and persecutions of the sky.	999
	The country gives me proof and precedent	999
	Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,	999
	Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms	999
	Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;	999
	And with this horrible object, from low farms,	999
	Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,	999
	Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,	999
	Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!	999

SCENE IV	Before GLOUCESTER's castle. KENT in the stocks.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING LEAR, Fool, and Gentleman]	999
	999
KING LEAR	'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,	999
	And not send back my messenger.	999
	999
Gentleman	As I learn'd,	999
	The night before there was no purpose in them	999
	Of this remove.	999
	999
KENT	                  Hail to thee, noble master!	999
	999
KING LEAR	Ha!	999
	Makest thou this shame thy pastime?	999
	999
KENT	No, my lord.	999
	999
Fool	Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied	999
	by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by	999
	the loins, and men by the legs: when a man's	999
	over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden	999
	nether-stocks.	999
	999
KING LEAR	What's he that hath so much thy place mistook	999
	To set thee here?	999
	999
KENT	                  It is both he and she;	999
	Your son and daughter.	999
	999
KING LEAR	No.	999
	999
KENT	Yes.	999
	999
KING LEAR	No, I say.	999
	999
KENT	I say, yea.	999
	999
KING LEAR	No, no, they would not.	999
	999
KENT	Yes, they have.	999
	999
KING LEAR	By Jupiter, I swear, no.	999
	999
KENT	By Juno, I swear, ay.	999
	999
KING LEAR	They durst not do 't;	999
	They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,	999
	To do upon respect such violent outrage:	999
	Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way	999
	Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,	999
	Coming from us.	999
	999
KENT	                  My lord, when at their home	999
	I did commend your highness' letters to them,	999
	Ere I was risen from the place that show'd	999
	My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,	999
	Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth	999
	From Goneril his mistress salutations;	999
	Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,	999
	Which presently they read: on whose contents,	999
	They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;	999
	Commanded me to follow, and attend	999
	The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:	999
	And meeting here the other messenger,	999
	Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--	999
	Being the very fellow that of late	999
	Display'd so saucily against your highness,--	999
	Having more man than wit about me, drew:	999
	He raised the house with loud and coward cries.	999
	Your son and daughter found this trespass worth	999
	The shame which here it suffers.	999
	999
Fool	Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.	999
	Fathers that wear rags	999
	Do make their children blind;	999
	But fathers that bear bags	999
	Shall see their children kind.	999
	Fortune, that arrant whore,	999
	Ne'er turns the key to the poor.	999
	But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours	999
	for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.	999
	999
KING LEAR	O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!	999
	Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,	999
	Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?	999
	999
KENT	With the earl, sir, here within.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Follow me not;	999
	Stay here.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
Gentleman	Made you no more offence but what you speak of?	999
	999
KENT	None.	999
	How chance the king comes with so small a train?	999
	999
Fool	And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that	999
	question, thou hadst well deserved it.	999
	999
KENT	Why, fool?	999
	999
Fool	We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee	999
	there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow	999
	their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and	999
	there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him	999
	that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel	999
	runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with	999
	following it: but the great one that goes up the	999
	hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man	999
	gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I	999
	would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.	999
	That sir which serves and seeks for gain,	999
	And follows but for form,	999
	Will pack when it begins to rain,	999
	And leave thee in the storm,	999
	But I will tarry; the fool will stay,	999
	And let the wise man fly:	999
	The knave turns fool that runs away;	999
	The fool no knave, perdy.	999
	999
KENT	Where learned you this, fool?	999
	999
Fool	Not i' the stocks, fool.	999
	999
	[Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
KING LEAR	Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?	999
	They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;	999
	The images of revolt and flying off.	999
	Fetch me a better answer.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	My dear lord,	999
	You know the fiery quality of the duke;	999
	How unremoveable and fix'd he is	999
	In his own course.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!	999
	Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,	999
	I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ay, my good lord.	999
	999
KING LEAR	The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father	999
	Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:	999
	Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!	999
	Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--	999
	No, but not yet: may be he is not well:	999
	Infirmity doth still neglect all office	999
	Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves	999
	When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind	999
	To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;	999
	And am fall'n out with my more headier will,	999
	To take the indisposed and sickly fit	999
	For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore	999
	999
	[Looking on KENT]	999
	999
	Should he sit here? This act persuades me	999
	That this remotion of the duke and her	999
	Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.	999
	Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,	999
	Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,	999
	Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum	999
	Till it cry sleep to death.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I would have all well betwixt you.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING LEAR	O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!	999
	999
Fool	Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels	999
	when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em	999
	o' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,	999
	wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure	999
	kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.	999

	[Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants]	999

	999
CORNWALL	Hail to your grace!	999
	999
	[KENT is set at liberty]	999
	999
REGAN	I am glad to see your highness.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Regan, I think you are; I know what reason	999
	I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,	999
	I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,	999
	Sepulchring an adultress.	999
	999
	[To KENT]	999
	999
		    O, are you free?	999
	Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,	999
	Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied	999
	Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:	999
	999
	[Points to his heart]	999
	999
	I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe	999
	With how depraved a quality--O Regan!	999
	999
REGAN	I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.	999
	You less know how to value her desert	999
	Than she to scant her duty.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Say, how is that?	999
	999
REGAN	I cannot think my sister in the least	999
	Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance	999
	She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,	999
	'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,	999
	As clears her from all blame.	999
	999
KING LEAR	My curses on her!	999
	999
REGAN	                  O, sir, you are old.	999
	Nature in you stands on the very verge	999
	Of her confine: you should be ruled and led	999
	By some discretion, that discerns your state	999
	Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,	999
	That to our sister you do make return;	999
	Say you have wrong'd her, sir.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Ask her forgiveness?	999
	Do you but mark how this becomes the house:	999
	'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;	999
	999
	[Kneeling]	999
	999
	Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg	999
	That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'	999
	999
REGAN	Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:	999
	Return you to my sister.	999

KING LEAR	[Rising]  Never, Regan:	999
	She hath abated me of half my train;	999
	Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,	999
	Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:	999
	All the stored vengeances of heaven fall	999
	On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,	999
	You taking airs, with lameness!	999
	999
CORNWALL	Fie, sir, fie!	999
	999
KING LEAR	You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames	999
	Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,	999
	You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,	999
	To fall and blast her pride!	999
	999
REGAN	O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,	999
	When the rash mood is on.	999
	999
KING LEAR	No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:	999
	Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give	999
	Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine	999
	Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee	999
	To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,	999
	To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,	999
	And in conclusion to oppose the bolt	999
	Against my coming in: thou better know'st	999
	The offices of nature, bond of childhood,	999
	Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;	999
	Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,	999
	Wherein I thee endow'd.	999
	999
REGAN	Good sir, to the purpose.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Who put my man i' the stocks?	999
	999
	[Tucket within]	999
	999
CORNWALL	What trumpet's that?	999
	999
REGAN	I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,	999
	That she would soon be here.	999
	999
	[Enter OSWALD]	999
	999
		       Is your lady come?	999
	999
KING LEAR	This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride	999
	Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.	999
	Out, varlet, from my sight!	999
	999
CORNWALL	What means your grace?	999
	999
KING LEAR	Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope	999
	Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,	999
	999
	[Enter GONERIL]	999
	999
	If you do love old men, if your sweet sway	999
	Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,	999
	Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!	999
	999
	[To GONERIL]	999
	999
	Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?	999
	O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?	999
	999
GONERIL	Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?	999
	All's not offence that indiscretion finds	999
	And dotage terms so.	999
	999
KING LEAR	O sides, you are too tough;	999
	Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?	999
	999
CORNWALL	I set him there, sir: but his own disorders	999
	Deserved much less advancement.	999
	999
KING LEAR	You! did you?	999
	999
REGAN	I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.	999
	If, till the expiration of your month,	999
	You will return and sojourn with my sister,	999
	Dismissing half your train, come then to me:	999
	I am now from home, and out of that provision	999
	Which shall be needful for your entertainment.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?	999
	No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose	999
	To wage against the enmity o' the air;	999
	To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--	999
	Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?	999
	Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took	999
	Our youngest born, I could as well be brought	999
	To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg	999
	To keep base life afoot. Return with her?	999
	Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter	999
	To this detested groom.	999
	999
	[Pointing at OSWALD]	999
	999
GONERIL	At your choice, sir.	999
	999
KING LEAR	I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:	999
	I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:	999
	We'll no more meet, no more see one another:	999
	But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;	999
	Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,	999
	Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,	999
	A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,	999
	In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;	999
	Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:	999
	I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,	999
	Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:	999
	Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:	999
	I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,	999
	I and my hundred knights.	999
	999
REGAN	Not altogether so:	999
	I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided	999
	For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;	999
	For those that mingle reason with your passion	999
	Must be content to think you old, and so--	999
	But she knows what she does.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Is this well spoken?	999
	999
REGAN	I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?	999
	Is it not well? What should you need of more?	999
	Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger	999
	Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,	999
	Should many people, under two commands,	999
	Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.	999
	999
GONERIL	Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance	999
	From those that she calls servants or from mine?	999
	999
REGAN	Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,	999
	We could control them. If you will come to me,--	999
	For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you	999
	To bring but five and twenty: to no more	999
	Will I give place or notice.	999
	999
KING LEAR	I gave you all--	999
	999
REGAN	                  And in good time you gave it.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Made you my guardians, my depositaries;	999
	But kept a reservation to be follow'd	999
	With such a number. What, must I come to you	999
	With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?	999
	999
REGAN	And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,	999
	When others are more wicked: not being the worst	999
	Stands in some rank of praise.	999
	999
	[To GONERIL]	999
	999
		         I'll go with thee:	999
	Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,	999
	And thou art twice her love.	999
	999
GONERIL	Hear me, my lord;	999
	What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,	999
	To follow in a house where twice so many	999
	Have a command to tend you?	999
	999
REGAN	What need one?	999
	999
KING LEAR	O, reason not the need: our basest beggars	999
	Are in the poorest thing superfluous:	999
	Allow not nature more than nature needs,	999
	Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;	999
	If only to go warm were gorgeous,	999
	Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,	999
	Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--	999
	You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!	999
	You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,	999
	As full of grief as age; wretched in both!	999
	If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts	999
	Against their father, fool me not so much	999
	To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,	999
	And let not women's weapons, water-drops,	999
	Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,	999
	I will have such revenges on you both,	999
	That all the world shall--I will do such things,--	999
	What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be	999
	The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep	999
	No, I'll not weep:	999
	I have full cause of weeping; but this heart	999
	Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,	999
	Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!	999
	999
	[Exeunt KING LEAR, GLOUCESTER, KENT, and Fool]	999

	[Storm and tempest]	999
	999
CORNWALL	Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.	999
	999
REGAN	This house is little: the old man and his people	999
	Cannot be well bestow'd.	999
	999
GONERIL	'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,	999
	And must needs taste his folly.	999
	999
REGAN	For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,	999
	But not one follower.	999
	999
GONERIL	So am I purposed.	999
	Where is my lord of Gloucester?	999
	999
CORNWALL	Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.	999
	999
	[Re-enter GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	The king is in high rage.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Whither is he going?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.	999
	999
CORNWALL	'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.	999
	999
GONERIL	My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds	999
	Do sorely ruffle; for many miles about	999
	There's scarce a bush.	999
	999
REGAN	O, sir, to wilful men,	999
	The injuries that they themselves procure	999
	Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:	999
	He is attended with a desperate train;	999
	And what they may incense him to, being apt	999
	To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:	999
	My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.	999

SCENE I	A heath.	999
	999
	999
	[Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting]	999
	999
KENT	Who's there, besides foul weather?	999
	999
Gentleman	One minded like the weather, most unquietly.	999
	999
KENT	I know you. Where's the king?	999
	999
Gentleman	Contending with the fretful element:	999
	Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,	999
	Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,	999
	That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,	999
	Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,	999
	Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;	999
	Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn	999
	The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.	999
	This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,	999
	The lion and the belly-pinched wolf	999
	Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,	999
	And bids what will take all.	999
	999
KENT	But who is with him?	999
	999
Gentleman	None but the fool; who labours to out-jest	999
	His heart-struck injuries.	999
	999
KENT	Sir, I do know you;	999
	And dare, upon the warrant of my note,	999
	Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,	999
	Although as yet the face of it be cover'd	999
	With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;	999
	Who have--as who have not, that their great stars	999
	Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,	999
	Which are to France the spies and speculations	999
	Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,	999
	Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,	999
	Or the hard rein which both of them have borne	999
	Against the old kind king; or something deeper,	999
	Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;	999
	But, true it is, from France there comes a power	999
	Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,	999
	Wise in our negligence, have secret feet	999
	In some of our best ports, and are at point	999
	To show their open banner. Now to you:	999
	If on my credit you dare build so far	999
	To make your speed to Dover, you shall find	999
	Some that will thank you, making just report	999
	Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow	999
	The king hath cause to plain.	999
	I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;	999
	And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer	999
	This office to you.	999
	999
Gentleman	I will talk further with you.	999
	999
KENT	No, do not.	999
	For confirmation that I am much more	999
	Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take	999
	What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--	999
	As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;	999
	And she will tell you who your fellow is	999
	That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!	999
	I will go seek the king.	999
	999
Gentleman	Give me your hand: have you no more to say?	999
	999
KENT	Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;	999
	That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain	999
	That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him	999
	Holla the other.	999

KING LEAR	Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!	999
	You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout	999
	Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!	999
	You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,	999
	Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,	999
	Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,	999
	Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!	999
	Crack nature's moulds, an germens spill at once,	999
	That make ingrateful man!	999
	999
Fool	O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry	999
	house is better than this rain-water out o' door.	999
	Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters' blessing:	999
	here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!	999
	Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:	999
	I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;	999
	I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,	999
	You owe me no subscription: then let fall	999
	Your horrible pleasure: here I stand, your slave,	999
	A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man:	999
	But yet I call you servile ministers,	999
	That have with two pernicious daughters join'd	999
	Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head	999
	So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!	999
	999
Fool	He that has a house to put's head in has a good	999
	head-piece.	999
	The cod-piece that will house	999
	Before the head has any,	999
	The head and he shall louse;	999
	So beggars marry many.	999
	The man that makes his toe	999
	What he his heart should make	999
	Shall of a corn cry woe,	999
	And turn his sleep to wake.	999
	For there was never yet fair woman but she made	999
	mouths in a glass.	999
	999
KING LEAR	No, I will be the pattern of all patience;	999
	I will say nothing.	999
	999
	[Enter KENT]	999
	999
KENT	Who's there?	999
	999
Fool	Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece; that's a wise	999
	man and a fool.	999
	999
KENT	Alas, sir, are you here? things that love night	999
	Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies	999
	Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,	999
	And make them keep their caves: since I was man,	999
	Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,	999
	Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never	999
	Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry	999
	The affliction nor the fear.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Let the great gods,	999
	That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,	999
	Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,	999
	That hast within thee undivulged crimes,	999
	Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;	999
	Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue	999
	That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,	999
	That under covert and convenient seeming	999
	Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,	999
	Rive your concealing continents, and cry	999
	These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man	999
	More sinn'd against than sinning.	999
	999
KENT	Alack, bare-headed!	999
	Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;	999
	Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:	999
	Repose you there; while I to this hard house--	999
	More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;	999
	Which even but now, demanding after you,	999
	Denied me to come in--return, and force	999
	Their scanted courtesy.	999
	999
KING LEAR	My wits begin to turn.	999
	Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?	999
	I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?	999
	The art of our necessities is strange,	999
	That can make vile things precious. Come,	999
	your hovel.	999
	Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart	999
	That's sorry yet for thee.	999
	999
Fool	[Singing]	999
	999
	He that has and a little tiny wit--	999
	With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,--	999
	Must make content with his fortunes fit,	999
	For the rain it raineth every day.	999
	999
KING LEAR	True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.	999
	999
	[Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT]	999
	999
Fool	This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.	999
	I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:	999
	When priests are more in word than matter;	999
	When brewers mar their malt with water;	999
	When nobles are their tailors' tutors;	999
	No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;	999
	When every case in law is right;	999
	No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;	999
	When slanders do not live in tongues;	999
	Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;	999
	When usurers tell their gold i' the field;	999
	And bawds and whores do churches build;	999
	Then shall the realm of Albion	999
	Come to great confusion:	999
	Then comes the time, who lives to see't,	999
	That going shall be used with feet.	999
	This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.	999

	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural	999
	dealing. When I desire their leave that I might	999
	pity him, they took from me the use of mine own	999
	house; charged me, on pain of their perpetual	999
	displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for	999
	him, nor any way sustain him.	999
	999
EDMUND	Most savage and unnatural!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt	999
	the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have	999
	received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be	999
	spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:	999
	these injuries the king now bears will be revenged	999
	home; there's part of a power already footed: we	999
	must incline to the king. I will seek him, and	999
	privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with	999
	the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:	999
	if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.	999
	Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,	999
	the king my old master must be relieved. There is	999
	some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
EDMUND	This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke	999
	Instantly know; and of that letter too:	999

	Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the	999
	mind's free,	999
	The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind	999
	Doth from my senses take all feeling else	999
	Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!	999
	Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand	999
	For lifting food to't? But I will punish home:	999
	No, I will weep no more. In such a night	999
	To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.	999
	In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!	999
	Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,--	999
	O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;	999
	No more of that.	999
	999
KENT	                  Good my lord, enter here.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Prithee, go in thyself: seek thine own ease:	999
	This tempest will not give me leave to ponder	999
	On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.	999
	999
	[To the Fool]	999
	999
	In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,--	999
	Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.	999
	999
	[Fool goes in]	999
	999
	Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,	999
	That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,	999
	How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,	999
	Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you	999
	From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en	999
	Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;	999
	Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,	999
	That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,	999
	And show the heavens more just.	999
	999
EDGAR	[Within]  Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!	999
	999
	[The Fool runs out from the hovel]	999
	999
Fool	Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit	999
	Help me, help me!	999
	999
KENT	Give me thy hand. Who's there?	999
	999
Fool	A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.	999
	999
KENT	What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?	999
	Come forth.	999
	999
	[Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man]	999
	999
EDGAR	Away! the foul fiend follows me!	999
	Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.	999
	Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?	999
	And art thou come to this?	999
	999
EDGAR	Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul	999
	fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and	999
	through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;	999
	that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters	999
	in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made film	999
	proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over	999
	four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a	999
	traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,--O, do	999
	de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,	999
	star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some	999
	charity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could I	999
	have him now,--and there,--and there again, and there.	999
	999
	[Storm still]	999
	999
KING LEAR	What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?	999
	Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?	999
	999
Fool	Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air	999
	Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!	999
	999
KENT	He hath no daughters, sir.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature	999
	To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.	999
	Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers	999
	Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?	999
	Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot	999
	Those pelican daughters.	999
	999
EDGAR	Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:	999
	Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!	999
	999
Fool	This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.	999
	999
EDGAR	Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;	999
	keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with	999
	man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud	999
	array. Tom's a-cold.	999
	999
KING LEAR	What hast thou been?	999
	999
EDGAR	A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled	999
	my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of	999
	my mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness with	999
	her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and	999
	broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that	999
	slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:	999
	wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman	999
	out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of	999
	ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth,	999
	wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.	999
	Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of	999
	silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot	999
	out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen	999
	from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.	999
	Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:	999
	Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.	999
	Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.	999
	999
	[Storm still]	999
	999
KING LEAR	Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer	999
	with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.	999
	Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou	999
	owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep	999
	no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on	999
	's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:	999
	unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,	999
	forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!	999
	come unbutton here.	999
	999
	[Tearing off his clothes]	999
	999
Fool	Prithee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty night	999
	to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were	999
	like an old lecher's heart; a small spark, all the	999
	rest on's body cold. Look, here comes a walking fire.	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER, with a torch]	999
	999
EDGAR	This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins	999
	at curfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives	999
	the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the	999
	hare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the	999
	poor creature of earth.	999
	S. Withold footed thrice the old;	999
	He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;	999
	Bid her alight,	999
	And her troth plight,	999
	And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!	999
	999
KENT	How fares your grace?	999
	999
KING LEAR	What's he?	999
	999
KENT	Who's there? What is't you seek?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What are you there? Your names?	999
	999
EDGAR	Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad,	999
	the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in	999
	the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,	999
	eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat and	999
	the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the	999
	standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to	999
	tithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned; who	999
	hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his	999
	body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear;	999
	But mice and rats, and such small deer,	999
	Have been Tom's food for seven long year.	999
	Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What, hath your grace no better company?	999
	999
EDGAR	The prince of darkness is a gentleman:	999
	Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,	999
	That it doth hate what gets it.	999
	999
EDGAR	Poor Tom's a-cold.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer	999
	To obey in all your daughters' hard commands:	999
	Though their injunction be to bar my doors,	999
	And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,	999
	Yet have I ventured to come seek you out,	999
	And bring you where both fire and food is ready.	999
	999
KING LEAR	First let me talk with this philosopher.	999
	What is the cause of thunder?	999
	999
KENT	Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.	999
	999
KING LEAR	I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.	999
	What is your study?	999
	999
EDGAR	How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Let me ask you one word in private.	999
	999
KENT	Importune him once more to go, my lord;	999
	His wits begin to unsettle.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Canst thou blame him?	999
	999
	[Storm still]	999
	999
	His daughters seek his death: ah, that good Kent!	999
	He said it would be thus, poor banish'd man!	999
	Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,	999
	I am almost mad myself: I had a son,	999
	Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,	999
	But lately, very late: I loved him, friend;	999
	No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,	999
	The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this!	999
	I do beseech your grace,--	999
	999
KING LEAR	O, cry your mercy, sir.	999
	Noble philosopher, your company.	999
	999
EDGAR	Tom's a-cold.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Come let's in all.	999
	999
KENT	                  This way, my lord.	999
	999
KING LEAR	With him;	999
	I will keep still with my philosopher.	999
	999
KENT	Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Take him you on.	999
	999
KENT	Sirrah, come on; go along with us.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Come, good Athenian.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	No words, no words: hush.	999
	999
EDGAR	      Child Rowland to the dark tower came,	999
	His word was still,--Fie, foh, and fum,	999
	I smell the blood of a British man.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter CORNWALL and EDMUND]	999
	999
CORNWALL	I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.	999
	999
EDMUND	How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus	999
	gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think	999
	of.	999
	999
CORNWALL	I now perceive, it was not altogether your	999
	brother's evil disposition made him seek his death;	999
	but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable	999
	badness in himself.	999
	999
EDMUND	How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to	999
	be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which	999
	approves him an intelligent party to the advantages	999
	of France: O heavens! that this treason were not,	999
	or not I the detector!	999
	999
CORNWALL	o with me to the duchess.	999
	999
EDMUND	If the matter of this paper be certain, you have	999
	mighty business in hand.	999
	999
CORNWALL	True or false, it hath made thee earl of	999
	Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he	999
	may be ready for our apprehension.	999
	999
EDMUND	[Aside]  If I find him comforting the king, it will	999
	stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in	999
	my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore	999
	between that and my blood.	999
	999
CORNWALL	I will lay trust upon thee; and thou shalt find a	999

	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER, KING LEAR, KENT, Fool, and EDGAR]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Here is better than the open air; take it	999
	thankfully. I will piece out the comfort with what	999
	addition I can: I will not be long from you.	999
	999
KENT	All the power of his wits have given way to his	999
	impatience: the gods reward your kindness!	999
	999
	[Exit GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
EDGAR	Frateretto calls me; and tells me	999
	Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.	999
	Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.	999
	999
Fool	Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a	999
	gentleman or a yeoman?	999
	999
KING LEAR	A king, a king!	999
	999
Fool	No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son;	999
	for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman	999
	before him.	999
	999
KING LEAR	To have a thousand with red burning spits	999
	Come hissing in upon 'em,--	999
	999
EDGAR	The foul fiend bites my back.	999
	999
Fool	He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a	999
	horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.	999
	999
KING LEAR	It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.	999
	999
	[To EDGAR]	999
	999
	Come, sit thou here, most learned justicer;	999
	999
	[To the Fool]	999
	999
	Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes!	999
	999
EDGAR	   Look, where he stands and glares!	999
	Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?	999
	Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,--	999
	999
Fool	   Her boat hath a leak,	999
	And she must not speak	999
	Why she dares not come over to thee.	999
	999
EDGAR	The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a	999
	nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two	999
	white herring. Croak not, black angel; I have no	999
	food for thee.	999
	999
KENT	How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed:	999
	Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?	999
	999
KING LEAR	I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.	999
	999
	[To EDGAR]	999
	999
	Thou robed man of justice, take thy place;	999
	999
	[To the Fool]	999
	999
	And thou, his yoke-fellow of equity,	999
	Bench by his side:	999
	999
	[To KENT]	999
	999
	you are o' the commission,	999
	Sit you too.	999
	999
EDGAR	Let us deal justly.	999
	Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?	999
	Thy sheep be in the corn;	999
	And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,	999
	Thy sheep shall take no harm.	999
	Pur! the cat is gray.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take my	999
	oath before this honourable assembly, she kicked the	999
	poor king her father.	999
	999
Fool	Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?	999
	999
KING LEAR	She cannot deny it.	999
	999
Fool	Cry you mercy, I took you for a joint-stool.	999
	999
KING LEAR	And here's another, whose warp'd looks proclaim	999
	What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!	999
	Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!	999
	False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?	999
	999
EDGAR	Bless thy five wits!	999
	999
KENT	O pity! Sir, where is the patience now,	999
	That thou so oft have boasted to retain?	999
	999
EDGAR	[Aside]  My tears begin to take his part so much,	999
	They'll mar my counterfeiting.	999
	999
KING LEAR	The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and	999
	Sweet-heart, see, they bark at me.	999
	999
EDGAR	Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!	999
	Be thy mouth or black or white,	999
	Tooth that poisons if it bite;	999
	Mastiff, grey-hound, mongrel grim,	999
	Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,	999
	Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,	999
	Tom will make them weep and wail:	999
	For, with throwing thus my head,	999
	Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.	999
	Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and	999
	fairs and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds	999
	about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that	999
	makes these hard hearts?	999
	999
	[To EDGAR]	999
	999
	You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred; only I	999
	do not like the fashion of your garments: you will	999
	say they are Persian attire: but let them be changed.	999
	999
KENT	Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains:	999
	so, so, so. We'll go to supper i' he morning. So, so, so.	999
	999
Fool	And I'll go to bed at noon.	999
	999
	[Re-enter GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Come hither, friend: where is the king my master?	999
	999
KENT	Here, sir; but trouble him not, his wits are gone.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;	999
	I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him:	999
	There is a litter ready; lay him in 't,	999
	And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet	999
	Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master:	999
	If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,	999
	With thine, and all that offer to defend him,	999
	Stand in assured loss: take up, take up;	999
	And follow me, that will to some provision	999
	Give thee quick conduct.	999
	999
KENT	Oppressed nature sleeps:	999
	This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,	999
	Which, if convenience will not allow,	999
	Stand in hard cure.	999
	999
	[To the Fool]	999
	999
	Come, help to bear thy master;	999
	Thou must not stay behind.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Come, come, away.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but EDGAR]	999
	999
EDGAR	When we our betters see bearing our woes,	999
	We scarcely think our miseries our foes.	999
	Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,	999
	Leaving free things and happy shows behind:	999
	But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er skip,	999
	When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.	999
	How light and portable my pain seems now,	999
	When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,	999
	He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!	999
	Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,	999
	When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,	999
	In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.	999
	What will hap more to-night, safe 'scape the king!	999
	Lurk, lurk.	999

	999
GONERIL	Pluck out his eyes.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our	999
	sister company: the revenges we are bound to take	999
	upon your traitorous father are not fit for your	999
	beholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, to	999
	a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the	999

OSWALD	My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:	999

	Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;	999
	Who, with some other of the lords dependants,	999
	Are gone with him towards Dover; where they boast	999

	[Exeunt other Servants]	999
	999
	Though well we may not pass upon his life	999
	Without the form of justice, yet our power	999
	Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men	999
	May blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER, brought in by two or three]	999
	999
REGAN	Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Bind fast his corky arms.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What mean your graces? Good my friends, consider	999
	You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Bind him, I say.	999
	999
	[Servants bind him]	999
	999
REGAN	                  Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.	999
	999
CORNWALL	To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--	999
	999
	[REGAN plucks his beard]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done	999
	To pluck me by the beard.	999
	999
REGAN	So white, and such a traitor!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Naughty lady,	999
	These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,	999
	Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:	999
	With robbers' hands my hospitable favours	999
	You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?	999
	999
CORNWALL	Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?	999
	999
REGAN	Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.	999
	999
CORNWALL	And what confederacy have you with the traitors	999
	Late footed in the kingdom?	999
	999
REGAN	To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I have a letter guessingly set down,	999
	Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,	999
	And not from one opposed.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Cunning.	999
	999
REGAN	And false.	999
	999
CORNWALL	Where hast thou sent the king?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	To Dover.	999
	999
REGAN	Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--	999
	999
CORNWALL	Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.	999
	999
REGAN	Wherefore to Dover, sir?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Because I would not see thy cruel nails	999
	Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister	999
	In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.	999
	The sea, with such a storm as his bare head	999
	In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,	999
	And quench'd the stelled fires:	999
	Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.	999
	If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,	999
	Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'	999
	All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see	999
	The winged vengeance overtake such children.	999
	999
CORNWALL	See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.	999
	Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He that will think to live till he be old,	999
	Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!	999
	999
REGAN	One side will mock another; the other too.	999
	999
CORNWALL	If you see vengeance,--	999
	999
First Servant	Hold your hand, my lord:	999
	I have served you ever since I was a child;	999
	But better service have I never done you	999
	Than now to bid you hold.	999
	999
REGAN	How now, you dog!	999
	999
First Servant	If you did wear a beard upon your chin,	999
	I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?	999
	999
CORNWALL	My villain!	999
	999
	[They draw and fight]	999
	999
First Servant	Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.	999
	999
REGAN	Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!	999
	999
	[Takes a sword, and runs at him behind]	999
	999
First Servant	O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left	999
	To see some mischief on him. O!	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
CORNWALL	Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!	999
	Where is thy lustre now?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?	999
	Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,	999
	To quit this horrid act.	999
	999
REGAN	Out, treacherous villain!	999
	Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he	999
	That made the overture of thy treasons to us;	999
	Who is too good to pity thee.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	O my follies! then Edgar was abused.	999
	Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!	999
	999
REGAN	Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell	999
	His way to Dover.	999
	999
	[Exit one with GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
	How is't, my lord? how look you?	999
	999
CORNWALL	I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.	999
	Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave	999
	Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:	999
	Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.	999
	999
	[Exit CORNWALL, led by REGAN]	999
	999
Second Servant	I'll never care what wickedness I do,	999
	If this man come to good.	999
	999
Third Servant	If she live long,	999
	And in the end meet the old course of death,	999
	Women will all turn monsters.	999
	999
Second Servant	Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam	999
	To lead him where he would: his roguish madness	999
	Allows itself to any thing.	999
	999
Third Servant	Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs	999
	To apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!	999

	999
	[Enter EDGAR]	999
	999
EDGAR	Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,	999
	Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,	999
	The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,	999
	Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:	999
	The lamentable change is from the best;	999
	The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,	999
	Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!	999
	The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst	999
	Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER, led by an Old Man]	999
	999
	My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!	999
	But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,	999
	Lie would not yield to age.	999
	999
Old Man	O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, and	999
	your father's tenant, these fourscore years.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:	999
	Thy comforts can do me no good at all;	999
	Thee they may hurt.	999
	999
Old Man	Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;	999
	I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,	999
	Our means secure us, and our mere defects	999
	Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,	999
	The food of thy abused father's wrath!	999
	Might I but live to see thee in my touch,	999
	I'ld say I had eyes again!	999
	999
Old Man	How now! Who's there?	999
	999
EDGAR	[Aside]  O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at	999
	the worst'?	999
	I am worse than e'er I was.	999
	999
Old Man	'Tis poor mad Tom.	999
	999
EDGAR	[Aside]  And worse I may be yet: the worst is not	999
	So long as we can say  'This is the worst.'	999
	999
Old Man	Fellow, where goest?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Is it a beggar-man?	999
	999
Old Man	Madman and beggar too.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He has some reason, else he could not beg.	999
	I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;	999
	Which made me think a man a worm: my son	999
	Came then into my mind; and yet my mind	999
	Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard	999
	more since.	999
	As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.	999
	They kill us for their sport.	999
	999
EDGAR	[Aside]	How should this be?	999
	Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,	999
	Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Is that the naked fellow?	999
	999
Old Man	Ay, my lord.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,	999
	Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,	999
	I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;	999
	And bring some covering for this naked soul,	999
	Who I'll entreat to lead me.	999
	999
Old Man	Alack, sir, he is mad.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.	999
	Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;	999
	Above the rest, be gone.	999
	999
Old Man	I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,	999
	Come on't what will.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Sirrah, naked fellow,--	999
	999
EDGAR	Poor Tom's a-cold.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	I cannot daub it further.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Come hither, fellow.	999
	999
EDGAR	[Aside]  And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Know'st thou the way to Dover?	999
	999
EDGAR	Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor	999
	Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless	999
	thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five	999
	fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as	999
	Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of	999
	stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of	999
	mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids	999
	and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues	999
	Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched	999
	Makes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!	999
	Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,	999
	That slaves your ordinance, that will not see	999
	Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;	999
	So distribution should undo excess,	999
	And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?	999
	999
EDGAR	Ay, master.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	There is a cliff, whose high and bending head	999
	Looks fearfully in the confined deep:	999
	Bring me but to the very brim of it,	999
	And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear	999
	With something rich about me: from that place	999
	I shall no leading need.	999
	999
EDGAR	Give me thy arm:	999

	999
	999
	[Enter GONERIL and EDMUND]	999
	999
GONERIL	Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband	999
	Not met us on the way.	999
	999
	[Enter OSWALD]	999
	999
		 Now, where's your master'?	999
	999
OSWALD	Madam, within; but never man so changed.	999
	I told him of the army that was landed;	999
	He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:	999
	His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,	999
	And of the loyal service of his son,	999
	When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,	999
	And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:	999
	What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;	999
	What like, offensive.	999
	999
GONERIL	[To EDMUND]  Then shall you go no further.	999
	It is the cowish terror of his spirit,	999
	That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs	999
	Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way	999
	May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;	999
	Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:	999
	I must change arms at home, and give the distaff	999
	Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant	999
	Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,	999
	If you dare venture in your own behalf,	999
	A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;	999
	999
	[Giving a favour]	999
	999
	Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,	999
	Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:	999
	Conceive, and fare thee well.	999
	999
EDMUND	Yours in the ranks of death.	999
	999
GONERIL	My most dear Gloucester!	999
	999
	[Exit EDMUND]	999
	999
	O, the difference of man and man!	999
	To thee a woman's services are due:	999
	My fool usurps my body.	999
	999
OSWALD	Madam, here comes my lord.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter ALBANY]	999
	999
GONERIL	I have been worth the whistle.	999
	999
ALBANY	O Goneril!	999
	You are not worth the dust which the rude wind	999
	Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:	999
	That nature, which contemns its origin,	999
	Cannot be border'd certain in itself;	999
	She that herself will sliver and disbranch	999
	From her material sap, perforce must wither	999
	And come to deadly use.	999
	999
GONERIL	No more; the text is foolish.	999
	999
ALBANY	Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:	999
	Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?	999
	Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?	999
	A father, and a gracious aged man,	999
	Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,	999
	Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.	999
	Could my good brother suffer you to do it?	999
	A man, a prince, by him so benefited!	999
	If that the heavens do not their visible spirits	999
	Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,	999
	It will come,	999
	Humanity must perforce prey on itself,	999
	Like monsters of the deep.	999
	999
GONERIL	Milk-liver'd man!	999
	That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;	999
	Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning	999
	Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st	999
	Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd	999
	Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?	999
	France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;	999
	With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;	999
	Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest	999
	'Alack, why does he so?'	999
	999
ALBANY	See thyself, devil!	999
	Proper deformity seems not in the fiend	999
	So horrid as in woman.	999
	999
GONERIL	O vain fool!	999
	999
ALBANY	Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,	999
	Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness	999
	To let these hands obey my blood,	999
	They are apt enough to dislocate and tear	999
	Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,	999
	A woman's shape doth shield thee.	999
	999
GONERIL	Marry, your manhood now--	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
ALBANY	What news?	999
	999
Messenger	O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:	999
	Slain by his servant, going to put out	999
	The other eye of Gloucester.	999
	999
ALBANY	Gloucester's eye!	999
	999
Messenger	A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,	999
	Opposed against the act, bending his sword	999
	To his great master; who, thereat enraged,	999
	Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;	999
	But not without that harmful stroke, which since	999
	Hath pluck'd him after.	999
	999
ALBANY	This shows you are above,	999
	You justicers, that these our nether crimes	999
	So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!	999
	Lost he his other eye?	999
	999
Messenger	Both, both, my lord.	999
	This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;	999
	'Tis from your sister.	999
	999
GONERIL	[Aside]              One way I like this well;	999
	But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,	999
	May all the building in my fancy pluck	999
	Upon my hateful life: another way,	999
	The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ALBANY	Where was his son when they did take his eyes?	999
	999
Messenger	Come with my lady hither.	999
	999
ALBANY	He is not here.	999
	999
Messenger	No, my good lord; I met him back again.	999
	999
ALBANY	Knows he the wickedness?	999
	999
Messenger	Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;	999
	And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment	999
	Might have the freer course.	999
	999
ALBANY	Gloucester, I live	999
	To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,	999
	And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:	999
	Tell me what more thou know'st.	999

SCENE III	The French camp near Dover.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KENT and a Gentleman]	999
	999
KENT	Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back	999
	know you the reason?	999
	999
Gentleman	Something he left imperfect in the	999
	state, which since his coming forth is thought	999
	of; which imports to the kingdom so much	999
	fear and danger, that his personal return was	999
	most required and necessary.	999
	999
KENT	Who hath he left behind him general?	999
	999
Gentleman	The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.	999
	999
KENT	Did your letters pierce the queen to any	999
	demonstration of grief?	999
	999
Gentleman	Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;	999
	And now and then an ample tear trill'd down	999
	Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen	999
	Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,	999
	Sought to be king o'er her.	999
	999
KENT	O, then it moved her.	999
	999
Gentleman	Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove	999
	Who should express her goodliest. You have seen	999
	Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears	999
	Were like a better way: those happy smilets,	999
	That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know	999
	What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,	999
	As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,	999
	Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,	999
	If all could so become it.	999
	999
KENT	Made she no verbal question?	999
	999
Gentleman	'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'	999
	Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:	999
	Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!	999
	Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?	999
	Let pity not be believed!' There she shook	999
	The holy water from her heavenly eyes,	999
	And clamour moisten'd: then away she started	999
	To deal with grief alone.	999
	999
KENT	It is the stars,	999
	The stars above us, govern our conditions;	999
	Else one self mate and mate could not beget	999
	Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?	999
	999
Gentleman	No.	999
	999
KENT	Was this before the king return'd?	999
	999
Gentleman	No, since.	999
	999
KENT	Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;	999
	Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers	999
	What we are come about, and by no means	999
	Will yield to see his daughter.	999
	999
Gentleman	Why, good sir?	999
	999
KENT	A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,	999
	That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her	999
	To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights	999
	To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting	999
	His mind so venomously, that burning shame	999
	Detains him from Cordelia.	999
	999
Gentleman	Alack, poor gentleman!	999
	999
KENT	Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?	999
	999
Gentleman	'Tis so, they are afoot.	999
	999
KENT	Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,	999
	And leave you to attend him: some dear cause	999
	Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;	999
	When I am known aright, you shall not grieve	999

	999
CORDELIA	Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now	999
	As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;	999
	Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,	999
	With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,	999
	Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow	999
	In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;	999
	Search every acre in the high-grown field,	999
	And bring him to our eye.	999
	999
	[Exit an Officer]	999
	999
		    What can man's wisdom	999
	In the restoring his bereaved sense?	999
	He that helps him take all my outward worth.	999
	999
Doctor	There is means, madam:	999
	Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,	999
	The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,	999
	Are many simples operative, whose power	999
	Will close the eye of anguish.	999
	999
CORDELIA	All blest secrets,	999
	All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,	999
	Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate	999
	In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;	999
	Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life	999
	That wants the means to lead it.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	News, madam;	999
	The British powers are marching hitherward.	999
	999
CORDELIA	'Tis known before; our preparation stands	999
	In expectation of them. O dear father,	999
	It is thy business that I go about;	999
	Therefore great France	999
	My mourning and important tears hath pitied.	999
	No blown ambition doth our arms incite,	999
	But love, dear love, and our aged father's right:	999
	Soon may I hear and see him!	999

	999
	[Enter REGAN and OSWALD]	999
	999
REGAN	But are my brother's powers set forth?	999
	999
OSWALD	Ay, madam.	999
	999
REGAN	Himself in person there?	999
	999
OSWALD	Madam, with much ado:	999
	Your sister is the better soldier.	999
	999
REGAN	Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?	999
	999
OSWALD	No, madam.	999
	999
REGAN	What might import my sister's letter to him?	999
	999
OSWALD	I know not, lady.	999
	999
REGAN	'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.	999
	It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,	999
	To let him live: where he arrives he moves	999
	All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,	999
	In pity of his misery, to dispatch	999
	His nighted life: moreover, to descry	999
	The strength o' the enemy.	999
	999
OSWALD	I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.	999
	999
REGAN	Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;	999
	The ways are dangerous.	999
	999
OSWALD	I may not, madam:	999
	My lady charged my duty in this business.	999
	999
REGAN	Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you	999
	Transport her purposes by word? Belike,	999
	Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,	999
	Let me unseal the letter.	999
	999
OSWALD	Madam, I had rather--	999
	999
REGAN	I know your lady does not love her husband;	999
	I am sure of that: and at her late being here	999
	She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks	999
	To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.	999
	999
OSWALD	I, madam?	999
	999
REGAN	I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:	999
	Therefore I do advise you, take this note:	999
	My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;	999
	And more convenient is he for my hand	999
	Than for your lady's: you may gather more.	999
	If you do find him, pray you, give him this;	999
	And when your mistress hears thus much from you,	999
	I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.	999
	So, fare you well.	999
	If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,	999
	Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.	999
	999
OSWALD	Would I could meet him, madam! I should show	999
	What party I do follow.	999
	999

	999
SCENE VI	Fields near Dover.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	When shall we come to the top of that same hill?	999
	999
EDGAR	You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Methinks the ground is even.	999
	999
EDGAR	Horrible steep.	999
	Hark, do you hear the sea?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	No, truly.	999
	999
EDGAR	Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect	999
	By your eyes' anguish.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	So may it be, indeed:	999
	Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st	999
	In better phrase and matter than thou didst.	999
	999
EDGAR	You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed	999
	But in my garments.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Methinks you're better spoken.	999
	999
EDGAR	Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful	999
	And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!	999
	The crows and choughs that wing the midway air	999
	Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down	999
	Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!	999
	Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:	999
	The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,	999
	Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,	999
	Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy	999
	Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,	999
	That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,	999
	Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;	999
	Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight	999
	Topple down headlong.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Set me where you stand.	999
	999
EDGAR	Give me your hand: you are now within a foot	999
	Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon	999
	Would I not leap upright.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Let go my hand.	999
	Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel	999
	Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods	999
	Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;	999
	Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.	999
	999
EDGAR	Now fare you well, good sir.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	With all my heart.	999
	999
EDGAR	Why I do trifle thus with his despair	999
	Is done to cure it.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Kneeling]  O you mighty gods!	999
	This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,	999
	Shake patiently my great affliction off:	999
	If I could bear it longer, and not fall	999
	To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,	999
	My snuff and loathed part of nature should	999
	Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!	999
	Now, fellow, fare thee well.	999
	999
	[He falls forward]	999
	999
EDGAR	Gone, sir: farewell.	999
	And yet I know not how conceit may rob	999
	The treasury of life, when life itself	999
	Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,	999
	By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?	999
	Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!	999
	Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.	999
	What are you, sir?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	                  Away, and let me die.	999
	999
EDGAR	Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,	999
	So many fathom down precipitating,	999
	Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;	999
	Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.	999
	Ten masts at each make not the altitude	999
	Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:	999
	Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	But have I fall'n, or no?	999
	999
EDGAR	From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.	999
	Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far	999
	Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Alack, I have no eyes.	999
	Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,	999
	To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,	999
	When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,	999
	And frustrate his proud will.	999
	999
EDGAR	Give me your arm:	999
	Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Too well, too well.	999
	999
EDGAR	This is above all strangeness.	999
	Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that	999
	Which parted from you?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	A poor unfortunate beggar.	999
	999
EDGAR	As I stood here below, methought his eyes	999
	Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,	999
	Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:	999
	It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,	999
	Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours	999
	Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear	999
	Affliction till it do cry out itself	999
	'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,	999
	I took it for a man; often 'twould say	999
	'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.	999
	999
EDGAR	Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers]	999
	999
	The safer sense will ne'er accommodate	999
	His master thus.	999
	999
KING LEAR	No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the	999
	king himself.	999
	999
EDGAR	O thou side-piercing sight!	999
	999
KING LEAR	Nature's above art in that respect. There's your	999
	press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a	999
	crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,	999
	look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted	999
	cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove	999
	it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well	999
	flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!	999
	Give the word.	999
	999
EDGAR	Sweet marjoram.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Pass.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I know that voice.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered	999
	me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my	999
	beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'	999
	and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'	999
	too was no good divinity. When the rain came to	999
	wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when	999
	the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I	999
	found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are	999
	not men o' their words: they told me I was every	999
	thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	The trick of that voice I do well remember:	999
	Is 't not the king?	999
	999
KING LEAR	Ay, every inch a king:	999
	When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.	999
	I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?	999
	Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:	999
	The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly	999
	Does lecher in my sight.	999
	Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son	999
	Was kinder to his father than my daughters	999
	Got 'tween the lawful sheets.	999
	To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.	999
	Behold yond simpering dame,	999
	Whose face between her forks presages snow;	999
	That minces virtue, and does shake the head	999
	To hear of pleasure's name;	999
	The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't	999
	With a more riotous appetite.	999
	Down from the waist they are Centaurs,	999
	Though women all above:	999
	But to the girdle do the gods inherit,	999
	Beneath is all the fiends';	999
	There's hell, there's darkness, there's the	999
	sulphurous pit,	999
	Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,	999
	fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,	999
	good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:	999
	there's money for thee.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	O, let me kiss that hand!	999
	999
KING LEAR	Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world	999
	Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?	999
	999
KING LEAR	I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny	999
	at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not	999
	love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the	999
	penning of it.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.	999
	999
EDGAR	I would not take this from report; it is,	999
	And my heart breaks at it.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Read.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What, with the case of eyes?	999
	999
KING LEAR	O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your	999
	head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in	999
	a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how	999
	this world goes.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I see it feelingly.	999
	999
KING LEAR	What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes	999
	with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond	999
	justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in	999
	thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which	999
	is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen	999
	a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ay, sir.	999
	999
KING LEAR	And the creature run from the cur? There thou	999
	mightst behold the great image of authority: a	999
	dog's obeyed in office.	999
	Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!	999
	Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;	999
	Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind	999
	For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.	999
	Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;	999
	Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,	999
	And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:	999
	Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.	999
	None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:	999
	Take that of me, my friend, who have the power	999
	To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;	999
	And like a scurvy politician, seem	999
	To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:	999
	Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.	999
	999
EDGAR	O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!	999
	999
KING LEAR	If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.	999
	I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:	999
	Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:	999
	Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,	999
	We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Alack, alack the day!	999
	999
KING LEAR	When we are born, we cry that we are come	999
	To this great stage of fools: this a good block;	999
	It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe	999
	A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;	999
	And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,	999
	Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!	999
	999
	[Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants]	999
	999
Gentleman	O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,	999
	Your most dear daughter--	999
	999
KING LEAR	No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even	999
	The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;	999
	You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;	999
	I am cut to the brains.	999
	999
Gentleman	You shall have any thing.	999
	999
KING LEAR	No seconds? all myself?	999
	Why, this would make a man a man of salt,	999
	To use his eyes for garden water-pots,	999
	Ay, and laying autumn's dust.	999
	999
Gentleman	Good sir,--	999
	999
KING LEAR	I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!	999
	I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,	999
	My masters, know you that.	999
	999
Gentleman	You are a royal one, and we obey you.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you	999
	shall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.	999
	999
	[Exit running; Attendants follow]	999
	999
Gentleman	A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,	999
	Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,	999
	Who redeems nature from the general curse	999
	Which twain have brought her to.	999
	999
EDGAR	Hail, gentle sir.	999
	999
Gentleman	                  Sir, speed you: what's your will?	999
	999
EDGAR	Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?	999
	999
Gentleman	Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,	999
	Which can distinguish sound.	999
	999
EDGAR	But, by your favour,	999
	How near's the other army?	999
	999
Gentleman	Near and on speedy foot; the main descry	999
	Stands on the hourly thought.	999
	999
EDGAR	I thank you, sir: that's all.	999
	999
Gentleman	Though that the queen on special cause is here,	999
	Her army is moved on.	999
	999
EDGAR	I thank you, sir.	999
	999
	[Exit Gentleman]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:	999
	Let not my worser spirit tempt me again	999
	To die before you please!	999
	999
EDGAR	Well pray you, father.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Now, good sir, what are you?	999
	999
EDGAR	A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;	999
	Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,	999
	Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,	999
	I'll lead you to some biding.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Hearty thanks:	999
	The bounty and the benison of heaven	999
	To boot, and boot!	999
	999
	[Enter OSWALD]	999
	999
OSWALD	A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!	999
	That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh	999
	To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,	999
	Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out	999
	That must destroy thee.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Now let thy friendly hand	999
	Put strength enough to't.	999
	999
	[EDGAR interposes]	999
	999
OSWALD	Wherefore, bold peasant,	999
	Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;	999
	Lest that the infection of his fortune take	999
	Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.	999
	999
EDGAR	Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.	999
	999
OSWALD	Let go, slave, or thou diest!	999
	999
EDGAR	Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk	999
	pass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,	999
	'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.	999
	Nay, come not near th' old man; keep out, che vor	999
	ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be	999
	the harder: ch'ill be plain with you.	999
	999
OSWALD	Out, dunghill!	999
	999
EDGAR	Ch'ill pick your teeth, zir: come; no matter vor	999
	your foins.	999
	999
	[They fight, and EDGAR knocks him down]	999
	999
OSWALD	Slave, thou hast slain me: villain, take my purse:	999
	If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;	999
	And give the letters which thou find'st about me	999
	To Edmund earl of Gloucester; seek him out	999
	Upon the British party: O, untimely death!	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
EDGAR	I know thee well: a serviceable villain;	999
	As duteous to the vices of thy mistress	999
	As badness would desire.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What, is he dead?	999
	999
EDGAR	Sit you down, father; rest you	999
	Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of	999
	May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry	999
	He had no other death's-man. Let us see:	999
	Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:	999
	To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;	999
	Their papers, is more lawful.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have	999
	many opportunities to cut him off: if your will	999
	want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered.	999
	There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror:	999
	then am I the prisoner, and his bed my goal; from	999
	the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply	999
	the place for your labour.	999
		'Your--wife, so I would say--	999
		'Affectionate servant,	999
		'GONERIL.'	999
	O undistinguish'd space of woman's will!	999
	A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;	999
	And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,	999
	Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified	999
	Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time	999
	With this ungracious paper strike the sight	999
	Of the death practised duke: for him 'tis well	999
	That of thy death and business I can tell.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,	999
	That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling	999
	Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:	999
	So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,	999
	And woes by wrong imaginations lose	999
	The knowledge of themselves.	999
	999
EDGAR	Give me your hand:	999
	999
	[Drum afar off]	999
	999
	Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum:	999
	Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.	999

	999
SCENE VII	A tent in the French camp. LEAR on a bed asleep,	999
	soft music playing; Gentleman, and others attending.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CORDELIA, KENT, and Doctor]	999
	999
CORDELIA	O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,	999
	To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,	999
	And every measure fail me.	999
	999
KENT	To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.	999
	All my reports go with the modest truth;	999
	Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.	999
	999
CORDELIA	Be better suited:	999
	These weeds are memories of those worser hours:	999
	I prithee, put them off.	999
	999
KENT	Pardon me, dear madam;	999
	Yet to be known shortens my made intent:	999
	My boon I make it, that you know me not	999
	Till time and I think meet.	999
	999
CORDELIA	Then be't so, my good lord.	999
	999
	[To the Doctor]	999
	999
		      How does the king?	999
	999
Doctor	Madam, sleeps still.	999
	999
CORDELIA	O you kind gods,	999
	Cure this great breach in his abused nature!	999
	The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up	999
	Of this child-changed father!	999
	999
Doctor	So please your majesty	999
	That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.	999
	999
CORDELIA	Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed	999
	I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?	999
	999
Gentleman	Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep	999
	We put fresh garments on him.	999
	999
Doctor	Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;	999
	I doubt not of his temperance.	999
	999
CORDELIA	Very well.	999
	999
Doctor	Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!	999
	999
CORDELIA	O my dear father! Restoration hang	999
	Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss	999
	Repair those violent harms that my two sisters	999
	Have in thy reverence made!	999
	999
KENT	Kind and dear princess!	999
	999
CORDELIA	Had you not been their father, these white flakes	999
	Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face	999
	To be opposed against the warring winds?	999
	To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?	999
	In the most terrible and nimble stroke	999
	Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--	999
	With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,	999
	Though he had bit me, should have stood that night	999
	Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,	999
	To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,	999
	In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!	999
	'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once	999
	Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.	999
	999
Doctor	Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.	999
	999
CORDELIA	How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?	999
	999
KING LEAR	You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:	999
	Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound	999
	Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears	999
	Do scald like moulten lead.	999
	999
CORDELIA	Sir, do you know me?	999
	999
KING LEAR	You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?	999
	999
CORDELIA	Still, still, far wide!	999
	999
Doctor	He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?	999
	I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,	999
	To see another thus. I know not what to say.	999
	I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;	999
	I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured	999
	Of my condition!	999
	999
CORDELIA	                  O, look upon me, sir,	999
	And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:	999
	No, sir, you must not kneel.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Pray, do not mock me:	999
	I am a very foolish fond old man,	999
	Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;	999
	And, to deal plainly,	999
	I fear I am not in my perfect mind.	999
	Methinks I should know you, and know this man;	999
	Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant	999
	What place this is; and all the skill I have	999
	Remembers not these garments; nor I know not	999
	Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;	999
	For, as I am a man, I think this lady	999
	To be my child Cordelia.	999
	999
CORDELIA	And so I am, I am.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:	999
	If you have poison for me, I will drink it.	999
	I know you do not love me; for your sisters	999
	Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:	999
	You have some cause, they have not.	999
	999
CORDELIA	No cause, no cause.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Am I in France?	999
	999
KENT	                  In your own kingdom, sir.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Do not abuse me.	999
	999
Doctor	Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,	999
	You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger	999
	To make him even o'er the time he has lost.	999
	Desire him to go in; trouble him no more	999
	Till further settling.	999
	999
CORDELIA	Will't please your highness walk?	999
	999
KING LEAR	You must bear with me:	999
	Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman]	999
	999
Gentleman	Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?	999
	999
KENT	Most certain, sir.	999
	999
Gentleman	Who is conductor of his people?	999
	999
KENT	As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.	999
	999
Gentleman	They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl	999
	of Kent in Germany.	999
	999
KENT	Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the	999
	powers of the kingdom approach apace.	999
	999
Gentleman	The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you	999
	well, sir.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999

	999
	[Enter, with drum and colours, EDMUND, REGAN,	999
	Gentlemen, and Soldiers.	999
	999
EDMUND	Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,	999
	Or whether since he is advised by aught	999
	To change the course: he's full of alteration	999
	And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.	999
	999
	[To a Gentleman, who goes out]	999
	999
REGAN	Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.	999
	999
EDMUND	'Tis to be doubted, madam.	999
	999
REGAN	Now, sweet lord,	999
	You know the goodness I intend upon you:	999
	Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,	999
	Do you not love my sister?	999
	999
EDMUND	In honour'd love.	999
	999
REGAN	But have you never found my brother's way	999
	To the forfended place?	999
	999
EDMUND	That thought abuses you.	999
	999
REGAN	I am doubtful that you have been conjunct	999
	And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.	999
	999
EDMUND	No, by mine honour, madam.	999
	999
REGAN	I never shall endure her: dear my lord,	999
	Be not familiar with her.	999
	999
EDMUND	Fear me not:	999
	She and the duke her husband!	999
	999
	[Enter, with drum and colours, ALBANY, GONERIL, and Soldiers]	999
	999
GONERIL	[Aside]  I had rather lose the battle than that sister	999
	Should loosen him and me.	999
	999
ALBANY	Our very loving sister, well be-met.	999
	Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,	999
	With others whom the rigor of our state	999
	Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,	999
	I never yet was valiant: for this business,	999
	It toucheth us, as France invades our land,	999
	Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,	999
	Most just and heavy causes make oppose.	999
	999
EDMUND	Sir, you speak nobly.	999
	999
REGAN	Why is this reason'd?	999
	999
GONERIL	Combine together 'gainst the enemy;	999
	For these domestic and particular broils	999
	Are not the question here.	999
	999
ALBANY	Let's then determine	999
	With the ancient of war on our proceedings.	999
	999
EDMUND	I shall attend you presently at your tent.	999
	999
REGAN	Sister, you'll go with us?	999
	999
GONERIL	No.	999
	999
REGAN	'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.	999
	999
GONERIL	[Aside]  O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.	999
	999
	[As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised]	999
	999
EDGAR	If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,	999
	Hear me one word.	999
	999
ALBANY	                  I'll overtake you. Speak.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR]	999
	999
EDGAR	Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.	999
	If you have victory, let the trumpet sound	999
	For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,	999
	I can produce a champion that will prove	999
	What is avouched there. If you miscarry,	999
	Your business of the world hath so an end,	999
	And machination ceases. Fortune love you.	999
	999
ALBANY	Stay till I have read the letter.	999
	999
EDGAR	I was forbid it.	999
	When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,	999
	And I'll appear again.	999
	999
ALBANY	Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.	999
	999
	[Exit EDGAR]	999
	999
	[Re-enter EDMUND]	999
	999
EDMUND	The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.	999
	Here is the guess of their true strength and forces	999
	By diligent discovery; but your haste	999
	Is now urged on you.	999
	999
ALBANY	We will greet the time.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
EDMUND	To both these sisters have I sworn my love;	999
	Each jealous of the other, as the stung	999
	Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?	999
	Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,	999
	If both remain alive: to take the widow	999
	Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;	999
	And hardly shall I carry out my side,	999
	Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use	999
	His countenance for the battle; which being done,	999
	Let her who would be rid of him devise	999
	His speedy taking off. As for the mercy	999
	Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,	999
	The battle done, and they within our power,	999
	Shall never see his pardon; for my state	999
	Stands on me to defend, not to debate.	999

	Give me thy hand; come on.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.	999
	999
EDGAR	What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure	999
	Their going hence, even as their coming hither;	999
	Ripeness is all: come on.	999

	999
EDMUND	Some officers take them away: good guard,	999
	Until their greater pleasures first be known	999
	That are to censure them.	999
	999
CORDELIA	We are not the first	999
	Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.	999
	For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;	999
	Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.	999
	Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?	999
	999
KING LEAR	No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:	999
	We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:	999
	When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,	999
	And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,	999
	And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh	999
	At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues	999
	Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,	999
	Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;	999
	And take upon's the mystery of things,	999
	As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,	999
	In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,	999
	That ebb and flow by the moon.	999
	999
EDMUND	Take them away.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,	999
	The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?	999
	He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,	999
	And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;	999
	The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,	999
	Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve	999
	first. Come.	999
	999
	[Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA, guarded]	999
	999
EDMUND	Come hither, captain; hark.	999
	Take thou this note;	999
	999
	[Giving a paper]	999
	999
		go follow them to prison:	999
	One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost	999
	As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way	999
	To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men	999
	Are as the time is: to be tender-minded	999
	Does not become a sword: thy great employment	999
	Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,	999
	Or thrive by other means.	999
	999
Captain	I'll do 't, my lord.	999
	999
EDMUND	About it; and write happy when thou hast done.	999
	Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so	999
	As I have set it down.	999

Captain	I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;	999

	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, another	999
	Captain, and Soldiers]	999
	999
ALBANY	Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,	999
	And fortune led you well: you have the captives	999
	That were the opposites of this day's strife:	999
	We do require them of you, so to use them	999
	As we shall find their merits and our safety	999
	May equally determine.	999
	999
EDMUND	Sir, I thought it fit	999
	To send the old and miserable king	999
	To some retention and appointed guard;	999
	Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,	999
	To pluck the common bosom on his side,	999
	An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes	999
	Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;	999
	My reason all the same; and they are ready	999
	To-morrow, or at further space, to appear	999
	Where you shall hold your session. At this time	999
	We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;	999
	And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed	999
	By those that feel their sharpness:	999
	The question of Cordelia and her father	999
	Requires a fitter place.	999
	999
ALBANY	Sir, by your patience,	999
	I hold you but a subject of this war,	999
	Not as a brother.	999
	999
REGAN	                  That's as we list to grace him.	999
	Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,	999
	Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;	999
	Bore the commission of my place and person;	999
	The which immediacy may well stand up,	999
	And call itself your brother.	999
	999
GONERIL	Not so hot:	999
	In his own grace he doth exalt himself,	999
	More than in your addition.	999
	999
REGAN	In my rights,	999
	By me invested, he compeers the best.	999
	999
GONERIL	That were the most, if he should husband you.	999
	999
REGAN	Jesters do oft prove prophets.	999
	999
GONERIL	Holla, holla!	999
	That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.	999
	999
REGAN	Lady, I am not well; else I should answer	999
	From a full-flowing stomach. General,	999
	Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;	999
	Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:	999
	Witness the world, that I create thee here	999
	My lord and master.	999
	999
GONERIL	Mean you to enjoy him?	999
	999
ALBANY	The let-alone lies not in your good will.	999
	999
EDMUND	Nor in thine, lord.	999
	999
ALBANY	Half-blooded fellow, yes.	999
	999
REGAN	[To EDMUND]  Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.	999
	999
ALBANY	Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee	999
	On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,	999
	This gilded serpent	999
	999
	[Pointing to Goneril]	999
	999
	For your claim, fair sister,	999
	I bar it in the interest of my wife:	999
	'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,	999
	And I, her husband, contradict your bans.	999
	If you will marry, make your loves to me,	999
	My lady is bespoke.	999
	999
GONERIL	An interlude!	999
	999
ALBANY	Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:	999
	If none appear to prove upon thy head	999
	Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,	999
	There is my pledge;	999
	999
	[Throwing down a glove]	999
	999
	I'll prove it on thy heart,	999
	Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less	999
	Than I have here proclaim'd thee.	999
	999
REGAN	Sick, O, sick!	999
	999
GONERIL	[Aside]  If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.	999
	999
EDMUND	There's my exchange:	999
	999
	[Throwing down a glove]	999
	999
		what in the world he is	999
	That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:	999
	Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,	999
	On him, on you, who not? I will maintain	999
	My truth and honour firmly.	999
	999
ALBANY	A herald, ho!	999
	999
EDMUND	                  A herald, ho, a herald!	999
	999
ALBANY	Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,	999
	All levied in my name, have in my name	999
	Took their discharge.	999
	999
REGAN	My sickness grows upon me.	999
	999
ALBANY	She is not well; convey her to my tent.	999
	999
	[Exit Regan, led]	999
	999
	[Enter a Herald]	999
	999
	Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,	999
	And read out this.	999
	999
Captain	Sound, trumpet!	999
	999
	[A trumpet sounds]	999
	999
Herald	[Reads]  'If any man of quality or degree within	999
	the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund,	999
	supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold	999
	traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the	999
	trumpet: he is bold in his defence.'	999
	999
EDMUND	Sound!	999
	999
	[First trumpet]	999
	999
Herald	Again!	999
	999
	[Second trumpet]	999
	999
Herald	Again!	999
	999
	[Third trumpet]	999
	999
	[Trumpet answers within]	999
	999
	[Enter EDGAR, at the third sound, armed, with a	999
	trumpet before him]	999
	999
ALBANY	Ask him his purposes, why he appears	999
	Upon this call o' the trumpet.	999
	999
Herald	What are you?	999
	Your name, your quality? and why you answer	999
	This present summons?	999
	999
EDGAR	Know, my name is lost;	999
	By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:	999
	Yet am I noble as the adversary	999
	I come to cope.	999
	999
ALBANY	                  Which is that adversary?	999
	999
EDGAR	What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?	999
	999
EDMUND	Himself: what say'st thou to him?	999
	999
EDGAR	Draw thy sword,	999
	That, if my speech offend a noble heart,	999
	Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.	999
	Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,	999
	My oath, and my profession: I protest,	999
	Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,	999
	Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,	999
	Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;	999
	False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;	999
	Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;	999
	And, from the extremest upward of thy head	999
	To the descent and dust below thy foot,	999
	A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'	999
	This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent	999
	To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,	999
	Thou liest.	999
	999
EDMUND	In wisdom I should ask thy name;	999
	But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,	999
	And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,	999
	What safe and nicely I might well delay	999
	By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:	999
	Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;	999
	With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;	999
	Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,	999
	This sword of mine shall give them instant way,	999
	Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!	999
	999
	[Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls]	999
	999
ALBANY	Save him, save him!	999
	999
GONERIL	This is practise, Gloucester:	999
	By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer	999
	An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,	999
	But cozen'd and beguiled.	999
	999
ALBANY	Shut your mouth, dame,	999
	Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir:	999
	Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:	999
	No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.	999
	999
	[Gives the letter to EDMUND]	999
	999
GONERIL	Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:	999
	Who can arraign me for't.	999
	999
ALBANY	Most monstrous! oh!	999
	Know'st thou this paper?	999
	999
GONERIL	Ask me not what I know.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ALBANY	Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.	999
	999
EDMUND	What you have charged me with, that have I done;	999
	And more, much more; the time will bring it out:	999
	'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou	999
	That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,	999
	I do forgive thee.	999
	999
EDGAR	                  Let's exchange charity.	999
	I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;	999
	If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.	999
	My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.	999
	The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices	999
	Make instruments to plague us:	999
	The dark and vicious place where thee he got	999
	Cost him his eyes.	999
	999
EDMUND	                  Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;	999
	The wheel is come full circle: I am here.	999
	999
ALBANY	Methought thy very gait did prophesy	999
	A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:	999
	Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I	999
	Did hate thee or thy father!	999
	999
EDGAR	Worthy prince, I know't.	999
	999
ALBANY	Where have you hid yourself?	999
	How have you known the miseries of your father?	999
	999
EDGAR	By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;	999
	And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!	999
	The bloody proclamation to escape,	999
	That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!	999
	That we the pain of death would hourly die	999
	Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift	999
	Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance	999
	That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit	999
	Met I my father with his bleeding rings,	999
	Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,	999
	Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;	999
	Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,	999
	Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:	999
	Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,	999
	I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last	999
	Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,	999
	Alack, too weak the conflict to support!	999
	'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,	999
	Burst smilingly.	999
	999
EDMUND	This speech of yours hath moved me,	999
	And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;	999
	You look as you had something more to say.	999
	999
ALBANY	If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;	999
	For I am almost ready to dissolve,	999
	Hearing of this.	999
	999
EDGAR	                  This would have seem'd a period	999
	To such as love not sorrow; but another,	999
	To amplify too much, would make much more,	999
	And top extremity.	999
	Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,	999
	Who, having seen me in my worst estate,	999
	Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding	999
	Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms	999
	He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out	999
	As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;	999
	Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him	999
	That ever ear received: which in recounting	999
	His grief grew puissant and the strings of life	999
	Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,	999
	And there I left him tranced.	999
	999
ALBANY	But who was this?	999
	999
EDGAR	Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise	999
	Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service	999
	Improper for a slave.	999
	999
	[Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife]	999
	999
Gentleman	Help, help, O, help!	999
	999
EDGAR	What kind of help?	999
	999
ALBANY	Speak, man.	999
	999
EDGAR	What means that bloody knife?	999
	999
Gentleman	'Tis hot, it smokes;	999
	It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!	999
	999
ALBANY	Who dead? speak, man.	999
	999
Gentleman	Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister	999
	By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.	999
	999
EDMUND	I was contracted to them both: all three	999
	Now marry in an instant.	999
	999
EDGAR	Here comes Kent.	999
	999
ALBANY	Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:	999
	This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,	999
	Touches us not with pity.	999
	999
	[Exit Gentleman]	999
	999
	[Enter KENT]	999
	999
		    O, is this he?	999
	The time will not allow the compliment	999
	Which very manners urges.	999
	999
KENT	I am come	999
	To bid my king and master aye good night:	999
	Is he not here?	999
	999
ALBANY	                  Great thing of us forgot!	999
	Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?	999
	See'st thou this object, Kent?	999
	999
	[The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in]	999
	999
KENT	Alack, why thus?	999
	999
EDMUND	                  Yet Edmund was beloved:	999
	The one the other poison'd for my sake,	999
	And after slew herself.	999
	999
ALBANY	Even so. Cover their faces.	999
	999
EDMUND	I pant for life: some good I mean to do,	999
	Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,	999
	Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ	999
	Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:	999
	Nay, send in time.	999
	999
ALBANY	                  Run, run, O, run!	999
	999
EDGAR	To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send	999
	Thy token of reprieve.	999
	999
EDMUND	Well thought on: take my sword,	999
	Give it the captain.	999
	999
ALBANY	Haste thee, for thy life.	999
	999
	[Exit EDGAR]	999
	999
EDMUND	He hath commission from thy wife and me	999
	To hang Cordelia in the prison, and	999
	To lay the blame upon her own despair,	999
	That she fordid herself.	999
	999
ALBANY	The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.	999
	999
	[EDMUND is borne off]	999
	999
	[Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms;	999
	EDGAR, Captain, and others following]	999
	999
KING LEAR	Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:	999
	Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so	999
	That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!	999
	I know when one is dead, and when one lives;	999
	She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;	999
	If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,	999
	Why, then she lives.	999
	999
KENT	Is this the promised end	999
	999
EDGAR	Or image of that horror?	999
	999
ALBANY	Fall, and cease!	999
	999
KING LEAR	This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,	999
	It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows	999
	That ever I have felt.	999
	999
KENT	[Kneeling]  O my good master!	999
	999
KING LEAR	Prithee, away.	999
	999
EDGAR	'Tis noble Kent, your friend.	999
	999
KING LEAR	A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!	999
	I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!	999
	Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!	999
	What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,	999
	Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.	999
	I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.	999
	999
Captain	'Tis true, my lords, he did.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Did I not, fellow?	999
	I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion	999
	I would have made them skip: I am old now,	999
	And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?	999
	Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.	999
	999
KENT	If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,	999
	One of them we behold.	999
	999
KING LEAR	This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?	999
	999
KENT	The same,	999
	Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?	999
	999
KING LEAR	He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;	999
	He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.	999
	999
KENT	No, my good lord; I am the very man,--	999
	999
KING LEAR	I'll see that straight.	999
	999
KENT	That, from your first of difference and decay,	999
	Have follow'd your sad steps.	999
	999
KING LEAR	You are welcome hither.	999
	999
KENT	Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.	999
	Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,	999
	And desperately are dead.	999
	999
KING LEAR	Ay, so I think.	999
	999
ALBANY	He knows not what he says: and vain it is	999
	That we present us to him.	999
	999
EDGAR	Very bootless.	999
	999
	[Enter a Captain]	999
	999
Captain	Edmund is dead, my lord.	999
	999
ALBANY	That's but a trifle here.	999
	You lords and noble friends, know our intent.	999
	What comfort to this great decay may come	999
	Shall be applied: for us we will resign,	999
	During the life of this old majesty,	999
	To him our absolute power:	999
	999
	[To EDGAR and KENT]	999
	999
		     you, to your rights:	999
	With boot, and such addition as your honours	999
	Have more than merited. All friends shall taste	999
	The wages of their virtue, and all foes	999
	The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!	999
	999
KING LEAR	And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!	999
	Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,	999
	And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,	999
	Never, never, never, never, never!	999
	Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.	999
	Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,	999
	Look there, look there!	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
EDGAR	He faints! My lord, my lord!	999
	999
KENT	Break, heart; I prithee, break!	999
	999
EDGAR	Look up, my lord.	999
	999
KENT	Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much	999
	That would upon the rack of this tough world	999
	Stretch him out longer.	999
	999
EDGAR	He is gone, indeed.	999
	999
KENT	The wonder is, he hath endured so long:	999
	He but usurp'd his life.	999
	999
ALBANY	Bear them from hence. Our present business	999
	Is general woe.	999
	999
	[To KENT and EDGAR]	999
	999
	Friends of my soul, you twain	999
	Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.	999
	999
KENT	I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;	999
	My master calls me, I must not say no.	999
	999
ALBANY	The weight of this sad time we must obey;	999
	Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.	999
	The oldest hath borne most: we that are young	999
	Shall never see so much, nor live so long.	999

	999
	[Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN,	999
	LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant]	999
	999
DUNCAN	What bloody man is that? He can report,	999
	As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt	999
	The newest state.	999
	999
MALCOLM	                  This is the sergeant	999
	Who like a good and hardy soldier fought	999
	'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!	999
	Say to the king the knowledge of the broil	999
	As thou didst leave it.	999
	999
Sergeant	Doubtful it stood;	999
	As two spent swimmers, that do cling together	999
	And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--	999
	Worthy to be a rebel, for to that	999
	The multiplying villanies of nature	999
	Do swarm upon him--from the western isles	999
	Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;	999
	And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,	999
	Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:	999
	For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--	999
	Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,	999
	Which smoked with bloody execution,	999
	Like valour's minion carved out his passage	999
	Till he faced the slave;	999
	Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,	999
	Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,	999
	And fix'd his head upon our battlements.	999
	999
DUNCAN	O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!	999
	999
Sergeant	As whence the sun 'gins his reflection	999
	Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,	999
	So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come	999
	Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:	999
	No sooner justice had with valour arm'd	999
	Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,	999
	But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,	999
	With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men	999
	Began a fresh assault.	999
	999
DUNCAN	Dismay'd not this	999
	Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?	999
	999
Sergeant	Yes;	999
	As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.	999
	If I say sooth, I must report they were	999
	As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they	999
	Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:	999
	Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,	999
	Or memorise another Golgotha,	999
	I cannot tell.	999
	But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.	999
	999
DUNCAN	So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;	999
	They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.	999

	999
MALCOLM	                  The worthy thane of Ross.	999
	999
LENNOX	What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look	999
	That seems to speak things strange.	999
	999
ROSS	God save the king!	999
	999
DUNCAN	Whence camest thou, worthy thane?	999
	999
ROSS	From Fife, great king;	999
	Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky	999
	And fan our people cold. Norway himself,	999
	With terrible numbers,	999
	Assisted by that most disloyal traitor	999
	The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;	999
	Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,	999
	Confronted him with self-comparisons,	999
	Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.	999
	Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,	999
	The victory fell on us.	999
	999
DUNCAN	Great happiness!	999
	999
ROSS	That now	999
	Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:	999
	Nor would we deign him burial of his men	999
	Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch	999
	Ten thousand dollars to our general use.	999
	999
DUNCAN	No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive	999
	Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,	999
	And with his former title greet Macbeth.	999
	999
ROSS	I'll see it done.	999
	999
DUNCAN	What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.	999

SCENE III	A heath near Forres.	999
	999
	999
	[Thunder. Enter the three Witches]	999
	999
First Witch	Where hast thou been, sister?	999
	999
Second Witch	Killing swine.	999
	999
Third Witch	Sister, where thou?	999
	999
First Witch	A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,	999
	And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--	999
	'Give me,' quoth I:	999
	'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.	999
	Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:	999
	But in a sieve I'll thither sail,	999
	And, like a rat without a tail,	999
	I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.	999
	999
Second Witch	I'll give thee a wind.	999
	999
First Witch	Thou'rt kind.	999
	999
Third Witch	And I another.	999
	999
First Witch	I myself have all the other,	999
	And the very ports they blow,	999
	All the quarters that they know	999
	I' the shipman's card.	999
	I will drain him dry as hay:	999
	Sleep shall neither night nor day	999
	Hang upon his pent-house lid;	999
	He shall live a man forbid:	999
	Weary se'nnights nine times nine	999
	Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:	999
	Though his bark cannot be lost,	999
	Yet it shall be tempest-tost.	999
	Look what I have.	999
	999
Second Witch	Show me, show me.	999
	999
First Witch	Here I have a pilot's thumb,	999
	Wreck'd as homeward he did come.	999
	999
	[Drum within]	999
	999
Third Witch	A drum, a drum!	999
	Macbeth doth come.	999
	999
ALL	The weird sisters, hand in hand,	999
	Posters of the sea and land,	999
	Thus do go about, about:	999
	Thrice to thine and thrice to mine	999
	And thrice again, to make up nine.	999
	Peace! the charm's wound up.	999
	999
	[Enter MACBETH and BANQUO]	999
	999
MACBETH	So foul and fair a day I have not seen.	999
	999
BANQUO	How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these	999
	So wither'd and so wild in their attire,	999
	That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,	999
	And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught	999
	That man may question? You seem to understand me,	999
	By each at once her chappy finger laying	999
	Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,	999
	And yet your beards forbid me to interpret	999
	That you are so.	999
	999
MACBETH	                  Speak, if you can: what are you?	999
	999
First Witch	All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!	999
	999
Second Witch	All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!	999
	999
Third Witch	All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!	999
	999
BANQUO	Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear	999
	Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,	999
	Are ye fantastical, or that indeed	999
	Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner	999
	You greet with present grace and great prediction	999
	Of noble having and of royal hope,	999
	That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.	999
	If you can look into the seeds of time,	999
	And say which grain will grow and which will not,	999
	Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear	999
	Your favours nor your hate.	999
	999
First Witch	Hail!	999
	999
Second Witch	Hail!	999
	999
Third Witch	Hail!	999
	999
First Witch	Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.	999
	999
Second Witch	Not so happy, yet much happier.	999
	999
Third Witch	Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:	999
	So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!	999
	999
First Witch	Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!	999
	999
MACBETH	Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:	999
	By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;	999
	But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,	999
	A prosperous gentleman; and to be king	999
	Stands not within the prospect of belief,	999
	No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence	999
	You owe this strange intelligence? or why	999
	Upon this blasted heath you stop our way	999
	With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.	999
	999
	[Witches vanish]	999
	999
BANQUO	The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,	999
	And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?	999
	999
MACBETH	Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted	999
	As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!	999
	999
BANQUO	Were such things here as we do speak about?	999
	Or have we eaten on the insane root	999
	That takes the reason prisoner?	999
	999
MACBETH	Your children shall be kings.	999
	999
BANQUO	You shall be king.	999
	999
MACBETH	And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?	999
	999
BANQUO	To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?	999
	999
	[Enter ROSS and ANGUS]	999
	999
ROSS	The king hath happily received, Macbeth,	999
	The news of thy success; and when he reads	999
	Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,	999
	His wonders and his praises do contend	999
	Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,	999
	In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,	999
	He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,	999
	Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,	999
	Strange images of death. As thick as hail	999
	Came post with post; and every one did bear	999
	Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,	999
	And pour'd them down before him.	999
	999
ANGUS	We are sent	999
	To give thee from our royal master thanks;	999
	Only to herald thee into his sight,	999
	Not pay thee.	999
	999
ROSS	And, for an earnest of a greater honour,	999
	He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:	999
	In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!	999
	For it is thine.	999
	999
BANQUO	                  What, can the devil speak true?	999
	999
MACBETH	The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me	999
	In borrow'd robes?	999
	999
ANGUS	                  Who was the thane lives yet;	999
	But under heavy judgment bears that life	999
	Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined	999
	With those of Norway, or did line the rebel	999
	With hidden help and vantage, or that with both	999
	He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;	999
	But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,	999
	Have overthrown him.	999
	999
MACBETH	[Aside]  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!	999
	The greatest is behind.	999
	999
	[To ROSS and ANGUS]	999
	999
		  Thanks for your pains.	999
	999
	[To BANQUO]	999
	999
	Do you not hope your children shall be kings,	999
	When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me	999
	Promised no less to them?	999
	999
BANQUO	That trusted home	999
	Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,	999
	Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:	999
	And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,	999
	The instruments of darkness tell us truths,	999
	Win us with honest trifles, to betray's	999
	In deepest consequence.	999
	Cousins, a word, I pray you.	999
	999
MACBETH	[Aside]	Two truths are told,	999
	As happy prologues to the swelling act	999
	Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.	999
	999
	[Aside]  This supernatural soliciting	999
	Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,	999
	Why hath it given me earnest of success,	999
	Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:	999
	If good, why do I yield to that suggestion	999
	Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair	999
	And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,	999
	Against the use of nature? Present fears	999
	Are less than horrible imaginings:	999
	My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,	999
	Shakes so my single state of man that function	999
	Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is	999
	But what is not.	999
	999
BANQUO	                  Look, how our partner's rapt.	999
	999
MACBETH	[Aside]  If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,	999
	Without my stir.	999
	999
BANQUO	                  New horrors come upon him,	999
	Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould	999
	But with the aid of use.	999
	999
MACBETH	[Aside]                Come what come may,	999
	Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.	999
	999
BANQUO	Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.	999
	999
MACBETH	Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought	999
	With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains	999
	Are register'd where every day I turn	999
	The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.	999
	Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,	999
	The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak	999
	Our free hearts each to other.	999
	999
BANQUO	Very gladly.	999

	999
DUNCAN	Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not	999
	Those in commission yet return'd?	999
	999
MALCOLM	My liege,	999
	They are not yet come back. But I have spoke	999
	With one that saw him die: who did report	999
	That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,	999
	Implored your highness' pardon and set forth	999
	A deep repentance: nothing in his life	999
	Became him like the leaving it; he died	999
	As one that had been studied in his death	999
	To throw away the dearest thing he owed,	999
	As 'twere a careless trifle.	999
	999
DUNCAN	There's no art	999
	To find the mind's construction in the face:	999
	He was a gentleman on whom I built	999
	An absolute trust.	999
	999
	[Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS]	999
	999
	O worthiest cousin!	999
	The sin of my ingratitude even now	999
	Was heavy on me: thou art so far before	999
	That swiftest wing of recompense is slow	999
	To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,	999
	That the proportion both of thanks and payment	999
	Might have been mine! only I have left to say,	999
	More is thy due than more than all can pay.	999
	999
MACBETH	The service and the loyalty I owe,	999
	In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part	999
	Is to receive our duties; and our duties	999
	Are to your throne and state children and servants,	999
	Which do but what they should, by doing every thing	999
	Safe toward your love and honour.	999
	999
DUNCAN	Welcome hither:	999
	I have begun to plant thee, and will labour	999
	To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,	999
	That hast no less deserved, nor must be known	999
	No less to have done so, let me enfold thee	999
	And hold thee to my heart.	999
	999
BANQUO	There if I grow,	999
	The harvest is your own.	999
	999
DUNCAN	My plenteous joys,	999
	Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves	999
	In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,	999
	And you whose places are the nearest, know	999
	We will establish our estate upon	999
	Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter	999
	The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must	999
	Not unaccompanied invest him only,	999
	But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine	999
	On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,	999
	And bind us further to you.	999
	999
MACBETH	The rest is labour, which is not used for you:	999
	I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful	999
	The hearing of my wife with your approach;	999
	So humbly take my leave.	999
	999
DUNCAN	My worthy Cawdor!	999
	999
MACBETH	[Aside]  The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step	999
	On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,	999
	For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;	999
	Let not light see my black and deep desires:	999
	The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,	999
	Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DUNCAN	True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,	999
	And in his commendations I am fed;	999

	999
LADY MACBETH	'They met me in the day of success: and I have	999
	learned by the perfectest report, they have more in	999
	them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire	999
	to question them further, they made themselves air,	999
	into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in	999
	the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who	999
	all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,	999
	before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred	999
	me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that	999
	shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver	999
	thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou	999
	mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being	999
	ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it	999
	to thy heart, and farewell.'	999
	Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be	999
	What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;	999
	It is too full o' the milk of human kindness	999
	To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;	999
	Art not without ambition, but without	999
	The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,	999
	That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,	999
	And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,	999
	That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;	999
	And that which rather thou dost fear to do	999
	Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,	999
	That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;	999
	And chastise with the valour of my tongue	999
	All that impedes thee from the golden round,	999
	Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem	999
	To have thee crown'd withal.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999

		       What is your tidings?	999
	999
Messenger	The king comes here to-night.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Thou'rt mad to say it:	999
	Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,	999
	Would have inform'd for preparation.	999
	999
Messenger	So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:	999
	One of my fellows had the speed of him,	999
	Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more	999
	Than would make up his message.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Give him tending;	999

	999
	[Exit Messenger]	999
	999
		The raven himself is hoarse	999
	That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan	999
	Under my battlements. Come, you spirits	999
	That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,	999
	And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full	999
	Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;	999
	Stop up the access and passage to remorse,	999
	That no compunctious visitings of nature	999
	Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between	999
	The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,	999
	And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,	999
	Wherever in your sightless substances	999
	You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,	999
	And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,	999
	That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,	999
	Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,	999
	To cry 'Hold, hold!'	999

LADY MACBETH	O, never	999

	Your face, my thane, is as a book where men	999

	Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,	999
	Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,	999
	But be the serpent under't. He that's coming	999
	Must be provided for: and you shall put	999
	This night's great business into my dispatch;	999

	[Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM,	999
	DONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS,	999
	and Attendants]	999
	999
DUNCAN	This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air	999
	Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself	999
	Unto our gentle senses.	999
	999
BANQUO	This guest of summer,	999
	The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,	999
	By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath	999
	Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,	999
	Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird	999
	Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:	999
	Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,	999
	The air is delicate.	999
	999
	[Enter LADY MACBETH]	999
	999
DUNCAN	See, see, our honour'd hostess!	999
	The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,	999
	Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you	999
	How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,	999
	And thank us for your trouble.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	All our service	999
	In every point twice done and then done double	999
	Were poor and single business to contend	999
	Against those honours deep and broad wherewith	999
	Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,	999
	And the late dignities heap'd up to them,	999
	We rest your hermits.	999
	999
DUNCAN	Where's the thane of Cawdor?	999
	We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose	999
	To be his purveyor: but he rides well;	999
	And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him	999
	To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,	999
	We are your guest to-night.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Your servants ever	999
	Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,	999
	To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,	999
	Still to return your own.	999
	999
DUNCAN	Give me your hand;	999
	Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,	999
	And shall continue our graces towards him.	999
	By your leave, hostess.	999

	999
	999
	[Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers	999
	Servants with dishes and service, and pass over the	999
	stage. Then enter MACBETH]	999
	999
MACBETH	If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well	999
	It were done quickly: if the assassination	999
	Could trammel up the consequence, and catch	999
	With his surcease success; that but this blow	999
	Might be the be-all and the end-all here,	999
	But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,	999
	We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases	999
	We still have judgment here; that we but teach	999
	Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return	999
	To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice	999
	Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice	999
	To our own lips. He's here in double trust;	999
	First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,	999
	Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,	999
	Who should against his murderer shut the door,	999
	Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan	999
	Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been	999
	So clear in his great office, that his virtues	999
	Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against	999
	The deep damnation of his taking-off;	999
	And pity, like a naked new-born babe,	999
	Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed	999
	Upon the sightless couriers of the air,	999
	Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,	999
	That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur	999
	To prick the sides of my intent, but only	999
	Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself	999
	And falls on the other.	999
	999
	[Enter LADY MACBETH]	999
	999
		  How now! what news?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?	999
	999
MACBETH	Hath he ask'd for me?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Know you not he has?	999
	999
MACBETH	We will proceed no further in this business:	999
	He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought	999
	Golden opinions from all sorts of people,	999
	Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,	999
	Not cast aside so soon.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Was the hope drunk	999
	Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?	999
	And wakes it now, to look so green and pale	999
	At what it did so freely? From this time	999
	Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard	999
	To be the same in thine own act and valour	999
	As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that	999
	Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,	999
	And live a coward in thine own esteem,	999
	Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'	999
	Like the poor cat i' the adage?	999
	999
MACBETH	Prithee, peace:	999
	I dare do all that may become a man;	999
	Who dares do more is none.	999
LADY MACBETH	What beast was't, then,	999
	That made you break this enterprise to me?	999
	When you durst do it, then you were a man;	999
	And, to be more than what you were, you would	999
	Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place	999
	Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:	999
	They have made themselves, and that their fitness now	999
	Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know	999
	How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:	999
	I would, while it was smiling in my face,	999
	Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,	999
	And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you	999
	Have done to this.	999
	999
MACBETH	                  If we should fail?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	We fail!	999
	But screw your courage to the sticking-place,	999
	And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--	999
	Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey	999
	Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains	999
	Will I with wine and wassail so convince	999
	That memory, the warder of the brain,	999
	Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason	999
	A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep	999
	Their drenched natures lie as in a death,	999
	What cannot you and I perform upon	999
	The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon	999
	His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt	999
	Of our great quell?	999
	999
MACBETH	Bring forth men-children only;	999
	For thy undaunted mettle should compose	999
	Nothing but males. Will it not be received,	999
	When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two	999
	Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,	999
	That they have done't?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Who dares receive it other,	999
	As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar	999
	Upon his death?	999
	999
MACBETH	                  I am settled, and bend up	999
	Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.	999
	Away, and mock the time with fairest show:	999
	False face must hide what the false heart doth know.	999

	999
	[Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him]	999
	999
BANQUO	How goes the night, boy?	999
	999
FLEANCE	The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.	999
	999
BANQUO	And she goes down at twelve.	999
	999
FLEANCE	I take't, 'tis later, sir.	999
	999
BANQUO	Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;	999
	Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.	999
	A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,	999
	And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,	999
	Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature	999
	Gives way to in repose!	999
	999
	[Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch]	999
	999
		  Give me my sword.	999
	Who's there?	999
	999
MACBETH	A friend.	999
	999
BANQUO	What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:	999
	He hath been in unusual pleasure, and	999
	Sent forth great largess to your offices.	999
	This diamond he greets your wife withal,	999
	By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up	999
	In measureless content.	999
	999
MACBETH	Being unprepared,	999
	Our will became the servant to defect;	999
	Which else should free have wrought.	999
	999
BANQUO	All's well.	999
	I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:	999
	To you they have show'd some truth.	999
	999
MACBETH	I think not of them:	999
	Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,	999
	We would spend it in some words upon that business,	999
	If you would grant the time.	999
	999
BANQUO	At your kind'st leisure.	999
	999
MACBETH	If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,	999
	It shall make honour for you.	999
	999
BANQUO	So I lose none	999
	In seeking to augment it, but still keep	999
	My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,	999
	I shall be counsell'd.	999
	999
MACBETH	Good repose the while!	999
	999
BANQUO	Thanks, sir: the like to you!	999
	999
	[Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE]	999
	999
MACBETH	Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,	999
	She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant]	999
	999
	Is this a dagger which I see before me,	999
	The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.	999
	I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.	999
	Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible	999
	To feeling as to sight? or art thou but	999
	A dagger of the mind, a false creation,	999
	Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?	999
	I see thee yet, in form as palpable	999
	As this which now I draw.	999
	Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;	999
	And such an instrument I was to use.	999
	Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,	999
	Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,	999
	And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,	999
	Which was not so before. There's no such thing:	999
	It is the bloody business which informs	999
	Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld	999
	Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse	999
	The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates	999
	Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,	999
	Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,	999
	Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.	999
	With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design	999
	Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,	999
	Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear	999
	Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,	999
	And take the present horror from the time,	999
	Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:	999
	Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.	999
	999
	[A bell rings]	999
	999
	I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.	999
	Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell	999
	That summons thee to heaven or to hell.	999

SCENE II	The same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LADY MACBETH]	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;	999
	What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.	999
	Hark! Peace!	999
	It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,	999
	Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:	999
	The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms	999
	Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd	999
	their possets,	999
	That death and nature do contend about them,	999
	Whether they live or die.	999
	999
MACBETH	[Within]  Who's there? what, ho!	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,	999
	And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed	999
	Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;	999
	He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled	999
	My father as he slept, I had done't.	999
	999
	[Enter MACBETH]	999
	999
		                  My husband!	999
	999
MACBETH	I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.	999
	Did not you speak?	999
	999
MACBETH	                  When?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Now.	999
	999
MACBETH	As I descended?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Ay.	999
	999
MACBETH	Hark!	999
	Who lies i' the second chamber?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Donalbain.	999
	999
MACBETH	This is a sorry sight.	999
	999
	[Looking on his hands]	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.	999
	999
MACBETH	There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried	999
	'Murder!'	999
	That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:	999
	But they did say their prayers, and address'd them	999
	Again to sleep.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	                  There are two lodged together.	999
	999
MACBETH	One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;	999
	As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.	999
	Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'	999
	When they did say 'God bless us!'	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Consider it not so deeply.	999
	999
MACBETH	But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?	999
	I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'	999
	Stuck in my throat.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	These deeds must not be thought	999
	After these ways; so, it will make us mad.	999
	999
MACBETH	Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!	999
	Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,	999
	Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,	999
	The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,	999
	Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,	999
	Chief nourisher in life's feast,--	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	What do you mean?	999
	999
MACBETH	Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:	999
	'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor	999
	Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,	999
	You do unbend your noble strength, to think	999
	So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,	999
	And wash this filthy witness from your hand.	999
	Why did you bring these daggers from the place?	999
	They must lie there: go carry them; and smear	999
	The sleepy grooms with blood.	999
	999
MACBETH	I'll go no more:	999
	I am afraid to think what I have done;	999
	Look on't again I dare not.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Infirm of purpose!	999
	Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead	999
	Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood	999
	That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,	999
	I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;	999
	For it must seem their guilt.	999
	999
	[Exit. Knocking within]	999
	999
MACBETH	Whence is that knocking?	999
	How is't with me, when every noise appals me?	999
	What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.	999
	Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood	999
	Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather	999
	The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,	999
	Making the green one red.	999
	999
	[Re-enter LADY MACBETH]	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	My hands are of your colour; but I shame	999
	To wear a heart so white.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	999
		    I hear a knocking	999
	At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;	999
	A little water clears us of this deed:	999
	How easy is it, then! Your constancy	999
	Hath left you unattended.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	999
		   Hark! more knocking.	999
	Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,	999
	And show us to be watchers. Be not lost	999
	So poorly in your thoughts.	999
	999
MACBETH	To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999

	999
	999
	[Knocking within. Enter a Porter]	999
	999
Porter	Here's a knocking indeed! If a	999
	man were porter of hell-gate, he should have	999
	old turning the key.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
		Knock,	999
	knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of	999
	Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged	999
	himself on the expectation of plenty: come in	999
	time; have napkins enow about you; here	999
	you'll sweat for't.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	Knock,	999
	knock! Who's there, in the other devil's	999
	name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could	999
	swear in both the scales against either scale;	999
	who committed treason enough for God's sake,	999
	yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come	999
	in, equivocator.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	Knock,	999
	knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an	999
	English tailor come hither, for stealing out of	999
	a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may	999
	roast your goose.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	Knock,	999
	knock; never at quiet! What are you? But	999
	this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter	999
	it no further: I had thought to have let in	999
	some of all professions that go the primrose	999
	way to the everlasting bonfire.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	999
	Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.	999
	999
	[Opens the gate]	999
	999
	[Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX]	999
	999
MACDUFF	Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,	999
	That you do lie so late?	999
	999
Porter	'Faith sir, we were carousing till the	999
	second cock: and drink, sir, is a great	999
	provoker of three things.	999
	999
MACDUFF	What three things does drink especially provoke?	999
	999
Porter	Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and	999
	urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;	999
	it provokes the desire, but it takes	999
	away the performance: therefore, much drink	999
	may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:	999
	it makes him, and it mars him; it sets	999
	him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,	999
	and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and	999
	not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him	999
	in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.	999
	999
MACDUFF	I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.	999
	999
Porter	That it did, sir, i' the very throat on	999
	me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I	999
	think, being too strong for him, though he took	999
	up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast	999
	him.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Is thy master stirring?	999
	999
	[Enter MACBETH]	999
	999
	Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.	999
	999
LENNOX	Good morrow, noble sir.	999
	999
MACBETH	Good morrow, both.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Is the king stirring, worthy thane?	999
	999
MACBETH	Not yet.	999
	999
MACDUFF	He did command me to call timely on him:	999
	I have almost slipp'd the hour.	999
	999
MACBETH	I'll bring you to him.	999
	999
MACDUFF	I know this is a joyful trouble to you;	999
	But yet 'tis one.	999
	999
MACBETH	The labour we delight in physics pain.	999
	This is the door.	999
	999
MACDUFF	                  I'll make so bold to call,	999
	For 'tis my limited service.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LENNOX	Goes the king hence to-day?	999
	999
MACBETH	He does: he did appoint so.	999
	999
LENNOX	The night has been unruly: where we lay,	999
	Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,	999
	Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,	999
	And prophesying with accents terrible	999
	Of dire combustion and confused events	999
	New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird	999
	Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth	999
	Was feverous and did shake.	999
	999
MACBETH	'Twas a rough night.	999
	999
LENNOX	My young remembrance cannot parallel	999
	A fellow to it.	999
	999
	[Re-enter MACDUFF]	999
	999
MACDUFF	O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart	999
	Cannot conceive nor name thee!	999
	999
	999
MACBETH	|	999
	|	What's the matter.	999
LENNOX	|	999
	999
	999
MACDUFF	Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!	999
	Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope	999
	The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence	999
	The life o' the building!	999
	999
MACBETH	What is 't you say? the life?	999
	999
LENNOX	Mean you his majesty?	999
	999
MACDUFF	Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight	999
	With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;	999
	See, and then speak yourselves.	999
	999
	[Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX]	999
	999
		          Awake, awake!	999
	Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!	999
	Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!	999
	Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,	999
	And look on death itself! up, up, and see	999
	The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!	999
	As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,	999
	To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.	999
	999
	[Bell rings]	999
	999
	[Enter LADY MACBETH]	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	What's the business,	999
	That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley	999
	The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!	999
	999
MACDUFF	O gentle lady,	999
	'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:	999
	The repetition, in a woman's ear,	999
	Would murder as it fell.	999
	999
	[Enter BANQUO]	999
	999
		   O Banquo, Banquo,	999
	Our royal master 's murder'd!	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Woe, alas!	999
	What, in our house?	999
	999
BANQUO	Too cruel any where.	999
	Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,	999
	And say it is not so.	999
	999
	[Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS]	999
	999
MACBETH	Had I but died an hour before this chance,	999
	I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,	999
	There 's nothing serious in mortality:	999
	All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;	999
	The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees	999
	Is left this vault to brag of.	999
	999
	[Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN]	999
	999
DONALBAIN	What is amiss?	999
	999
MACBETH	                  You are, and do not know't:	999
	The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood	999
	Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Your royal father 's murder'd.	999
	999
MALCOLM	O, by whom?	999
	999
LENNOX	Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:	999
	Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;	999
	So were their daggers, which unwiped we found	999
	Upon their pillows:	999
	They stared, and were distracted; no man's life	999
	Was to be trusted with them.	999
	999
MACBETH	O, yet I do repent me of my fury,	999
	That I did kill them.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Wherefore did you so?	999
	999
MACBETH	Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,	999
	Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:	999
	The expedition my violent love	999
	Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,	999
	His silver skin laced with his golden blood;	999
	And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature	999
	For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,	999
	Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers	999
	Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,	999
	That had a heart to love, and in that heart	999
	Courage to make 's love known?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Help me hence, ho!	999
	999
MACDUFF	Look to the lady.	999
	999
MALCOLM	[Aside to DONALBAIN]  Why do we hold our tongues,	999
	That most may claim this argument for ours?	999
	999
DONALBAIN	[Aside to MALCOLM]  What should be spoken here,	999
	where our fate,	999
	Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?	999
	Let 's away;	999
	Our tears are not yet brew'd.	999
	999
MALCOLM	[Aside to DONALBAIN]        Nor our strong sorrow	999
	Upon the foot of motion.	999
	999
BANQUO	Look to the lady:	999
	999
	[LADY MACBETH is carried out]	999
	999
	And when we have our naked frailties hid,	999
	That suffer in exposure, let us meet,	999
	And question this most bloody piece of work,	999
	To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:	999
	In the great hand of God I stand; and thence	999
	Against the undivulged pretence I fight	999
	Of treasonous malice.	999
	999
MACDUFF	And so do I.	999
	999
ALL	So all.	999
	999
MACBETH	Let's briefly put on manly readiness,	999
	And meet i' the hall together.	999
	999
ALL	Well contented.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.	999
	999
MALCOLM	What will you do? Let's not consort with them:	999
	To show an unfelt sorrow is an office	999
	Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.	999
	999
DONALBAIN	To Ireland, I; our separated fortune	999
	Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,	999
	There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,	999
	The nearer bloody.	999
	999
MALCOLM	                  This murderous shaft that's shot	999
	Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way	999
	Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;	999
	And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,	999
	But shift away: there's warrant in that theft	999
	Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.	999

	999
SCENE IV	Outside Macbeth's castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ROSS and an old Man]	999
	999
Old Man	Threescore and ten I can remember well:	999
	Within the volume of which time I have seen	999
	Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night	999
	Hath trifled former knowings.	999
	999
ROSS	Ah, good father,	999
	Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,	999
	Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,	999
	And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:	999
	Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,	999
	That darkness does the face of earth entomb,	999
	When living light should kiss it?	999
	999
Old Man	'Tis unnatural,	999
	Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,	999
	A falcon, towering in her pride of place,	999
	Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.	999
	999
ROSS	And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--	999
	Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,	999
	Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,	999
	Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make	999
	War with mankind.	999
	999
Old Man	'Tis said they eat each other.	999
	999
ROSS	They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes	999
	That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.	999
	999
	[Enter MACDUFF]	999
	999
	How goes the world, sir, now?	999
	999
MACDUFF	Why, see you not?	999
	999
ROSS	Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?	999
	999
MACDUFF	Those that Macbeth hath slain.	999
	999
ROSS	Alas, the day!	999
	What good could they pretend?	999
	999
MACDUFF	They were suborn'd:	999
	Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,	999
	Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them	999
	Suspicion of the deed.	999
	999
ROSS	'Gainst nature still!	999
	Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up	999
	Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like	999
	The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.	999
	999
MACDUFF	He is already named, and gone to Scone	999
	To be invested.	999
	999
ROSS	                  Where is Duncan's body?	999
	999
MACDUFF	Carried to Colmekill,	999
	The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,	999
	And guardian of their bones.	999
	999
ROSS	Will you to Scone?	999
	999
MACDUFF	No, cousin, I'll to Fife.	999
	999
ROSS	Well, I will thither.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!	999
	Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!	999
	999
ROSS	Farewell, father.	999
	999
Old Man	God's benison go with you; and with those	999
	That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!	999

SCENE I	Forres. The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter BANQUO]	999
	999
BANQUO	Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,	999
	As the weird women promised, and, I fear,	999
	Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said	999
	It should not stand in thy posterity,	999
	But that myself should be the root and father	999
	Of many kings. If there come truth from them--	999
	As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--	999
	Why, by the verities on thee made good,	999
	May they not be my oracles as well,	999
	And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.	999
	999
	[Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY	999
	MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and	999
	Attendants]	999
	999
MACBETH	Here's our chief guest.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	If he had been forgotten,	999
	It had been as a gap in our great feast,	999
	And all-thing unbecoming.	999
	999
MACBETH	To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,	999
	And I'll request your presence.	999
	999
BANQUO	Let your highness	999
	Command upon me; to the which my duties	999
	Are with a most indissoluble tie	999
	For ever knit.	999
	999
MACBETH	                  Ride you this afternoon?	999
	999
BANQUO	Ay, my good lord.	999
	999
MACBETH	We should have else desired your good advice,	999
	Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,	999
	In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.	999
	Is't far you ride?	999
	999
BANQUO	As far, my lord, as will fill up the time	999
	'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,	999
	I must become a borrower of the night	999
	For a dark hour or twain.	999
	999
MACBETH	Fail not our feast.	999
	999
BANQUO	My lord, I will not.	999
	999
MACBETH	We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd	999
	In England and in Ireland, not confessing	999
	Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers	999
	With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,	999
	When therewithal we shall have cause of state	999
	Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,	999
	Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?	999
	999
BANQUO	Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.	999
	999
MACBETH	I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;	999
	And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit BANQUO]	999
	999
	Let every man be master of his time	999
	Till seven at night: to make society	999
	The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself	999
	Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant]	999
	999
	Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men	999
	Our pleasure?	999
	999
ATTENDANT	They are, my lord, without the palace gate.	999
	999
MACBETH	Bring them before us.	999
	999
	[Exit Attendant]	999
	999
		To be thus is nothing;	999
	But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo	999
	Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature	999
	Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;	999
	And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,	999
	He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour	999
	To act in safety. There is none but he	999
	Whose being I do fear: and, under him,	999
	My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,	999
	Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters	999
	When first they put the name of king upon me,	999
	And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like	999
	They hail'd him father to a line of kings:	999
	Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,	999
	And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,	999
	Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,	999
	No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,	999
	For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;	999
	For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;	999
	Put rancours in the vessel of my peace	999
	Only for them; and mine eternal jewel	999
	Given to the common enemy of man,	999
	To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!	999
	Rather than so, come fate into the list.	999
	And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!	999
	999
	[Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers]	999
	999
	Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.	999
	999
	[Exit Attendant]	999
	999
	Was it not yesterday we spoke together?	999
	999
First Murderer	It was, so please your highness.	999
	999
MACBETH	Well then, now	999
	Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know	999
	That it was he in the times past which held you	999
	So under fortune, which you thought had been	999
	Our innocent self: this I made good to you	999
	In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,	999
	How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,	999
	the instruments,	999
	Who wrought with them, and all things else that might	999
	To half a soul and to a notion crazed	999
	Say 'Thus did Banquo.'	999
	999
First Murderer	You made it known to us.	999
	999
MACBETH	I did so, and went further, which is now	999
	Our point of second meeting. Do you find	999
	Your patience so predominant in your nature	999
	That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd	999
	To pray for this good man and for his issue,	999
	Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave	999
	And beggar'd yours for ever?	999
	999
First Murderer	We are men, my liege.	999
	999
MACBETH	Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;	999
	As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,	999
	Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept	999
	All by the name of dogs: the valued file	999
	Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,	999
	The housekeeper, the hunter, every one	999
	According to the gift which bounteous nature	999
	Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive	999
	Particular addition. from the bill	999
	That writes them all alike: and so of men.	999
	Now, if you have a station in the file,	999
	Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;	999
	And I will put that business in your bosoms,	999
	Whose execution takes your enemy off,	999
	Grapples you to the heart and love of us,	999
	Who wear our health but sickly in his life,	999
	Which in his death were perfect.	999
	999
Second Murderer	I am one, my liege,	999
	Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world	999
	Have so incensed that I am reckless what	999
	I do to spite the world.	999
	999
First Murderer	And I another	999
	So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,	999
	That I would set my lie on any chance,	999
	To mend it, or be rid on't.	999
	999
MACBETH	Both of you	999
	Know Banquo was your enemy.	999
	999
Both Murderers	True, my lord.	999
	999
MACBETH	So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,	999
	That every minute of his being thrusts	999
	Against my near'st of life: and though I could	999
	With barefaced power sweep him from my sight	999
	And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,	999
	For certain friends that are both his and mine,	999
	Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall	999
	Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,	999
	That I to your assistance do make love,	999
	Masking the business from the common eye	999
	For sundry weighty reasons.	999
	999
Second Murderer	We shall, my lord,	999
	Perform what you command us.	999
	999
First Murderer	Though our lives--	999
	999
MACBETH	Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most	999
	I will advise you where to plant yourselves;	999
	Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,	999
	The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,	999
	And something from the palace; always thought	999
	That I require a clearness: and with him--	999
	To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--	999
	Fleance his son, that keeps him company,	999
	Whose absence is no less material to me	999
	Than is his father's, must embrace the fate	999
	Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:	999
	I'll come to you anon.	999
	999
Both Murderers	We are resolved, my lord.	999
	999
MACBETH	I'll call upon you straight: abide within.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Murderers]	999
	999
	It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,	999
	If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.	999

	999
	[Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant]	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Is Banquo gone from court?	999
	999
Servant	Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Say to the king, I would attend his leisure	999
	For a few words.	999
	999
Servant	                  Madam, I will.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Nought's had, all's spent,	999
	Where our desire is got without content:	999
	'Tis safer to be that which we destroy	999
	Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.	999
	999
	[Enter MACBETH]	999
	999
	How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,	999
	Of sorriest fancies your companions making,	999
	Using those thoughts which should indeed have died	999
	With them they think on? Things without all remedy	999
	Should be without regard: what's done is done.	999
	999
MACBETH	We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:	999
	She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice	999
	Remains in danger of her former tooth.	999
	But let the frame of things disjoint, both the	999
	worlds suffer,	999
	Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep	999
	In the affliction of these terrible dreams	999
	That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,	999
	Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,	999
	Than on the torture of the mind to lie	999
	In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;	999
	After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;	999
	Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,	999
	Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,	999
	Can touch him further.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Come on;	999
	Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;	999
	Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.	999
	999
MACBETH	So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:	999
	Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;	999
	Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:	999
	Unsafe the while, that we	999
	Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,	999
	And make our faces vizards to our hearts,	999
	Disguising what they are.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	You must leave this.	999
	999
MACBETH	O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!	999
	Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	But in them nature's copy's not eterne.	999
	999
MACBETH	There's comfort yet; they are assailable;	999
	Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown	999
	His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons	999
	The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums	999
	Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done	999
	A deed of dreadful note.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	What's to be done?	999
	999
MACBETH	Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,	999
	Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,	999
	Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;	999
	And with thy bloody and invisible hand	999
	Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond	999
	Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow	999
	Makes wing to the rooky wood:	999
	Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;	999
	While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.	999
	Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;	999
	Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.	999
	So, prithee, go with me.	999

SCENE III	A park near the palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter three Murderers]	999
	999
First Murderer	But who did bid thee join with us?	999
	999
Third Murderer	Macbeth.	999
	999
Second Murderer	He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers	999
	Our offices and what we have to do	999
	To the direction just.	999
	999
First Murderer	Then stand with us.	999
	The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:	999
	Now spurs the lated traveller apace	999
	To gain the timely inn; and near approaches	999
	The subject of our watch.	999
	999
Third Murderer	Hark! I hear horses.	999
	999
BANQUO	[Within]  Give us a light there, ho!	999
	999
Second Murderer	Then 'tis he: the rest	999
	That are within the note of expectation	999
	Already are i' the court.	999
	999
First Murderer	His horses go about.	999
	999
Third Murderer	Almost a mile: but he does usually,	999
	So all men do, from hence to the palace gate	999
	Make it their walk.	999
	999
Second Murderer	A light, a light!	999
	999
	[Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch]	999
	999
Third Murderer	'Tis he.	999
	999
First Murderer	Stand to't.	999
	999
BANQUO	It will be rain to-night.	999
	999
First Murderer	Let it come down.	999
	999
	[They set upon BANQUO]	999
	999
BANQUO	O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!	999
	Thou mayst revenge. O slave!	999
	999
	[Dies. FLEANCE escapes]	999
	999
Third Murderer	Who did strike out the light?	999
	999
First Murderer	Wast not the way?	999
	999
Third Murderer	There's but one down; the son is fled.	999
	999
Second Murderer	We have lost	999
	Best half of our affair.	999
	999
First Murderer	Well, let's away, and say how much is done.	999

	999
	999
	[A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH,	999
	ROSS, LENNOX, Lords, and Attendants]	999
	999
MACBETH	You know your own degrees; sit down: at first	999
	And last the hearty welcome.	999
Lords	Thanks to your majesty.	999
	999
MACBETH	Ourself will mingle with society,	999
	And play the humble host.	999
	Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time	999
	We will require her welcome.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;	999
	For my heart speaks they are welcome.	999
	999
	[First Murderer appears at the door]	999
	999
MACBETH	See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.	999
	Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:	999
	Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure	999
	The table round.	999
	999
	[Approaching the door]	999
	999
	There's blood on thy face.	999
	999
First Murderer	'Tis Banquo's then.	999
	999
MACBETH	'Tis better thee without than he within.	999
	Is he dispatch'd?	999
	999
First Murderer	My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.	999
	999
MACBETH	Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good	999
	That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,	999
	Thou art the nonpareil.	999
	999
First Murderer	Most royal sir,	999
	Fleance is 'scaped.	999
	999
MACBETH	Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,	999
	Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,	999
	As broad and general as the casing air:	999
	But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in	999
	To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?	999
	999
First Murderer	Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,	999
	With twenty trenched gashes on his head;	999
	The least a death to nature.	999
	999
MACBETH	Thanks for that:	999
	There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled	999
	Hath nature that in time will venom breed,	999
	No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow	999
	We'll hear, ourselves, again.	999
	999
	[Exit Murderer]	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	My royal lord,	999
	You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold	999
	That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,	999
	'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;	999
	From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;	999
	Meeting were bare without it.	999
	999
MACBETH	Sweet remembrancer!	999
	Now, good digestion wait on appetite,	999
	And health on both!	999
	999
LENNOX	May't please your highness sit.	999
	999
	[The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in	999
	MACBETH's place]	999
	999
MACBETH	Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,	999
	Were the graced person of our Banquo present;	999
	Who may I rather challenge for unkindness	999
	Than pity for mischance!	999
	999
ROSS	His absence, sir,	999
	Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness	999
	To grace us with your royal company.	999
	999
MACBETH	The table's full.	999
	999
LENNOX	                  Here is a place reserved, sir.	999
	999
MACBETH	Where?	999
	999
LENNOX	Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?	999
	999
MACBETH	Which of you have done this?	999
	999
Lords	What, my good lord?	999
	999
MACBETH	Thou canst not say I did it: never shake	999
	Thy gory locks at me.	999
	999
ROSS	Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,	999
	And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;	999
	The fit is momentary; upon a thought	999
	He will again be well: if much you note him,	999
	You shall offend him and extend his passion:	999
	Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?	999
	999
MACBETH	Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that	999
	Which might appal the devil.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	O proper stuff!	999
	This is the very painting of your fear:	999
	This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,	999
	Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,	999
	Impostors to true fear, would well become	999
	A woman's story at a winter's fire,	999
	Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!	999
	Why do you make such faces? When all's done,	999
	You look but on a stool.	999
	999
MACBETH	Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!	999
	how say you?	999
	Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.	999
	If charnel-houses and our graves must send	999
	Those that we bury back, our monuments	999
	Shall be the maws of kites.	999
	999
	[GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes]	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	What, quite unmann'd in folly?	999
	999
MACBETH	If I stand here, I saw him.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Fie, for shame!	999
	999
MACBETH	Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,	999
	Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;	999
	Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd	999
	Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,	999
	That, when the brains were out, the man would die,	999
	And there an end; but now they rise again,	999
	With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,	999
	And push us from our stools: this is more strange	999
	Than such a murder is.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	My worthy lord,	999
	Your noble friends do lack you.	999
	999
MACBETH	I do forget.	999
	Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,	999
	I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing	999
	To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;	999
	Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.	999
	I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,	999
	And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;	999
	Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,	999
	And all to all.	999
	999
Lords	                  Our duties, and the pledge.	999
	999
	[Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO]	999
	999
MACBETH	Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!	999
	Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;	999
	Thou hast no speculation in those eyes	999
	Which thou dost glare with!	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Think of this, good peers,	999
	But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;	999
	Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.	999
	999
MACBETH	What man dare, I dare:	999
	Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,	999
	The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;	999
	Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves	999
	Shall never tremble: or be alive again,	999
	And dare me to the desert with thy sword;	999
	If trembling I inhabit then, protest me	999
	The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!	999
	Unreal mockery, hence!	999
	999
	[GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes]	999
	999
		 Why, so: being gone,	999
	I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,	999
	With most admired disorder.	999
	999
MACBETH	Can such things be,	999
	And overcome us like a summer's cloud,	999
	Without our special wonder? You make me strange	999
	Even to the disposition that I owe,	999
	When now I think you can behold such sights,	999
	And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,	999
	When mine is blanched with fear.	999
	999
ROSS	What sights, my lord?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;	999
	Question enrages him. At once, good night:	999
	Stand not upon the order of your going,	999
	But go at once.	999
	999
LENNOX	                  Good night; and better health	999
	Attend his majesty!	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	A kind good night to all!	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH]	999
	999
MACBETH	It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:	999
	Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;	999
	Augurs and understood relations have	999
	By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth	999
	The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Almost at odds with morning, which is which.	999
	999
MACBETH	How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person	999
	At our great bidding?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Did you send to him, sir?	999
	999
MACBETH	I hear it by the way; but I will send:	999
	There's not a one of them but in his house	999
	I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,	999
	And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:	999
	More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,	999
	By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,	999
	All causes shall give way: I am in blood	999
	Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,	999
	Returning were as tedious as go o'er:	999
	Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;	999
	Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	You lack the season of all natures, sleep.	999
	999
MACBETH	Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse	999
	Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:	999
	We are yet but young in deed.	999

	999
	[Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE]	999
	999
First Witch	Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.	999
	999
HECATE	Have I not reason, beldams as you are,	999
	Saucy and overbold? How did you dare	999
	To trade and traffic with Macbeth	999
	In riddles and affairs of death;	999
	And I, the mistress of your charms,	999
	The close contriver of all harms,	999
	Was never call'd to bear my part,	999
	Or show the glory of our art?	999
	And, which is worse, all you have done	999
	Hath been but for a wayward son,	999
	Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,	999
	Loves for his own ends, not for you.	999
	But make amends now: get you gone,	999
	And at the pit of Acheron	999
	Meet me i' the morning: thither he	999
	Will come to know his destiny:	999
	Your vessels and your spells provide,	999
	Your charms and every thing beside.	999
	I am for the air; this night I'll spend	999
	Unto a dismal and a fatal end:	999
	Great business must be wrought ere noon:	999
	Upon the corner of the moon	999
	There hangs a vaporous drop profound;	999
	I'll catch it ere it come to ground:	999
	And that distill'd by magic sleights	999
	Shall raise such artificial sprites	999
	As by the strength of their illusion	999
	Shall draw him on to his confusion:	999
	He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear	999
	He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:	999
	And you all know, security	999
	Is mortals' chiefest enemy.	999
	999
	[Music and a song within: 'Come away, come	999
	away,' &c]	999

SCENE VI	Forres. The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LENNOX and another Lord]	999
	999
LENNOX	My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,	999
	Which can interpret further: only, I say,	999
	Things have been strangely borne. The	999
	gracious Duncan	999
	Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:	999
	And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;	999
	Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,	999
	For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.	999
	Who cannot want the thought how monstrous	999
	It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain	999
	To kill their gracious father? damned fact!	999
	How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight	999
	In pious rage the two delinquents tear,	999
	That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?	999
	Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;	999
	For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive	999
	To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,	999
	He has borne all things well: and I do think	999
	That had he Duncan's sons under his key--	999
	As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they	999
	should find	999
	What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.	999
	But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd	999
	His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear	999
	Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell	999
	Where he bestows himself?	999
	999
Lord	The son of Duncan,	999
	From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth	999
	Lives in the English court, and is received	999
	Of the most pious Edward with such grace	999
	That the malevolence of fortune nothing	999
	Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff	999
	Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid	999
	To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:	999
	That, by the help of these--with Him above	999
	To ratify the work--we may again	999
	Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,	999
	Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,	999
	Do faithful homage and receive free honours:	999
	All which we pine for now: and this report	999
	Hath so exasperate the king that he	999
	Prepares for some attempt of war.	999
	999
LENNOX	Sent he to Macduff?	999
	999
Lord	He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'	999
	The cloudy messenger turns me his back,	999
	And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time	999
	That clogs me with this answer.'	999
	999
LENNOX	And that well might	999
	Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance	999
	His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel	999
	Fly to the court of England and unfold	999
	His message ere he come, that a swift blessing	999
	May soon return to this our suffering country	999
	Under a hand accursed!	999
	999
Lord	I'll send my prayers with him.	999

	999
	999
First Witch	Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.	999
	999
Second Witch	Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.	999
	999
Third Witch	Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.	999
	999
First Witch	Round about the cauldron go;	999
	In the poison'd entrails throw.	999
	Toad, that under cold stone	999
	Days and nights has thirty-one	999
	Swelter'd venom sleeping got,	999
	Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.	999
	999
ALL	Double, double toil and trouble;	999
	Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.	999
	999
Second Witch	Fillet of a fenny snake,	999
	In the cauldron boil and bake;	999
	Eye of newt and toe of frog,	999
	Wool of bat and tongue of dog,	999
	Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,	999
	Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,	999
	For a charm of powerful trouble,	999
	Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.	999
	999
ALL	Double, double toil and trouble;	999
	Fire burn and cauldron bubble.	999
	999
Third Witch	Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,	999
	Witches' mummy, maw and gulf	999
	Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,	999
	Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,	999
	Liver of blaspheming Jew,	999
	Gall of goat, and slips of yew	999
	Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,	999
	Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,	999
	Finger of birth-strangled babe	999
	Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,	999
	Make the gruel thick and slab:	999
	Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,	999
	For the ingredients of our cauldron.	999
	999
ALL	Double, double toil and trouble;	999
	Fire burn and cauldron bubble.	999
	999
Second Witch	Cool it with a baboon's blood,	999
	Then the charm is firm and good.	999
	999
	[Enter HECATE to the other three Witches]	999
	999
HECATE	O well done! I commend your pains;	999
	And every one shall share i' the gains;	999
	And now about the cauldron sing,	999
	Live elves and fairies in a ring,	999
	Enchanting all that you put in.	999
	999
	[Music and a song: 'Black spirits,' &c]	999
	999
	[HECATE retires]	999
	999
Second Witch	By the pricking of my thumbs,	999
	Something wicked this way comes.	999
	Open, locks,	999
	Whoever knocks!	999
	999
	[Enter MACBETH]	999
	999
MACBETH	How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!	999
	What is't you do?	999
	999
ALL	                  A deed without a name.	999
	999
MACBETH	I conjure you, by that which you profess,	999
	Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:	999
	Though you untie the winds and let them fight	999
	Against the churches; though the yesty waves	999
	Confound and swallow navigation up;	999
	Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;	999
	Though castles topple on their warders' heads;	999
	Though palaces and pyramids do slope	999
	Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure	999
	Of nature's germens tumble all together,	999
	Even till destruction sicken; answer me	999
	To what I ask you.	999
	999
First Witch	                  Speak.	999
	999
Second Witch	Demand.	999
	999
Third Witch	We'll answer.	999
	999
First Witch	Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,	999
	Or from our masters?	999
	999
MACBETH	Call 'em; let me see 'em.	999
	999
First Witch	Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten	999
	Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten	999
	From the murderer's gibbet throw	999
	Into the flame.	999
	999
ALL	                  Come, high or low;	999
	Thyself and office deftly show!	999
	999
	[Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head]	999
	999
MACBETH	Tell me, thou unknown power,--	999
	999
First Witch	He knows thy thought:	999
	Hear his speech, but say thou nought.	999
	999
First Apparition	Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;	999
	Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.	999
	999
	[Descends]	999
	999
MACBETH	Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;	999
	Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one	999
	word more,--	999
	999
First Witch	He will not be commanded: here's another,	999
	More potent than the first.	999
	999
	[Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child]	999
	999
Second Apparition	Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!	999
	999
MACBETH	Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.	999
	999
Second Apparition	Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn	999
	The power of man, for none of woman born	999
	Shall harm Macbeth.	999
	999
	[Descends]	999
	999
MACBETH	Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?	999
	But yet I'll make assurance double sure,	999
	And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;	999
	That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,	999
	And sleep in spite of thunder.	999
	999
	[Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned,	999
	with a tree in his hand]	999
	999
		         What is this	999
	That rises like the issue of a king,	999
	And wears upon his baby-brow the round	999
	And top of sovereignty?	999
	999
ALL	Listen, but speak not to't.	999
	999
Third Apparition	Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care	999
	Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:	999
	Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until	999
	Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill	999
	Shall come against him.	999
	999
	[Descends]	999
	999
MACBETH	That will never be	999
	Who can impress the forest, bid the tree	999
	Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!	999
	Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood	999
	Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth	999
	Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath	999
	To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart	999
	Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art	999
	Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever	999
	Reign in this kingdom?	999
	999
ALL	Seek to know no more.	999
	999
MACBETH	I will be satisfied: deny me this,	999
	And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.	999
	Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?	999
	999
	[Hautboys]	999
	999
First Witch	Show!	999
	999
Second Witch	Show!	999
	999
Third Witch	Show!	999
	999
ALL	Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;	999
	Come like shadows, so depart!	999
	999
	[A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in	999
	his hand; GHOST OF BANQUO following]	999
	999
MACBETH	Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!	999
	Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,	999
	Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.	999
	A third is like the former. Filthy hags!	999
	Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!	999
	What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?	999
	Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:	999
	And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass	999
	Which shows me many more; and some I see	999
	That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:	999
	Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;	999
	For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,	999
	And points at them for his.	999
	999
	[Apparitions vanish]	999
	999
		      What, is this so?	999
	999
First Witch	Ay, sir, all this is so: but why	999
	Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?	999
	Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,	999
	And show the best of our delights:	999
	I'll charm the air to give a sound,	999
	While you perform your antic round:	999
	That this great king may kindly say,	999
	Our duties did his welcome pay.	999
	999
	[Music. The witches dance and then vanish,	999
	with HECATE]	999
	999
MACBETH	Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour	999
	Stand aye accursed in the calendar!	999
	Come in, without there!	999
	999
	[Enter LENNOX]	999
	999
LENNOX	What's your grace's will?	999
	999
MACBETH	Saw you the weird sisters?	999
	999
LENNOX	No, my lord.	999
	999
MACBETH	Came they not by you?	999
	999
LENNOX	No, indeed, my lord.	999
	999
MACBETH	Infected be the air whereon they ride;	999
	And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear	999
	The galloping of horse: who was't came by?	999
	999
LENNOX	'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word	999
	Macduff is fled to England.	999
	999
MACBETH	Fled to England!	999
	999
LENNOX	Ay, my good lord.	999
	999
MACBETH	Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:	999
	The flighty purpose never is o'ertook	999
	Unless the deed go with it; from this moment	999
	The very firstlings of my heart shall be	999
	The firstlings of my hand. And even now,	999
	To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:	999
	The castle of Macduff I will surprise;	999
	Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword	999
	His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls	999
	That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;	999
	This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.	999
	But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?	999
	Come, bring me where they are.	999

SCENE II	Fife. Macduff's castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS]	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	What had he done, to make him fly the land?	999
	999
ROSS	You must have patience, madam.	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	He had none:	999
	His flight was madness: when our actions do not,	999
	Our fears do make us traitors.	999
	999
ROSS	You know not	999
	Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,	999
	His mansion and his titles in a place	999
	From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;	999
	He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,	999
	The most diminutive of birds, will fight,	999
	Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.	999
	All is the fear and nothing is the love;	999
	As little is the wisdom, where the flight	999
	So runs against all reason.	999
	999
ROSS	My dearest coz,	999
	I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,	999
	He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows	999
	The fits o' the season. I dare not speak	999
	much further;	999
	But cruel are the times, when we are traitors	999
	And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour	999
	From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,	999
	But float upon a wild and violent sea	999
	Each way and move. I take my leave of you:	999
	Shall not be long but I'll be here again:	999
	Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward	999
	To what they were before. My pretty cousin,	999
	Blessing upon you!	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.	999
	999
ROSS	I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,	999
	It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:	999
	I take my leave at once.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Sirrah, your father's dead;	999
	And what will you do now? How will you live?	999
	999
Son	As birds do, mother.	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	What, with worms and flies?	999
	999
Son	With what I get, I mean; and so do they.	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,	999
	The pitfall nor the gin.	999
	999
Son	Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.	999
	My father is not dead, for all your saying.	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?	999
	999
Son	Nay, how will you do for a husband?	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.	999
	999
Son	Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,	999
	With wit enough for thee.	999
	999
Son	Was my father a traitor, mother?	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Ay, that he was.	999
	999
Son	What is a traitor?	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Why, one that swears and lies.	999
	999
Son	And be all traitors that do so?	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.	999
	999
Son	And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Every one.	999
	999
Son	Who must hang them?	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Why, the honest men.	999
	999
Son	Then the liars and swearers are fools,	999
	for there are liars and swearers enow to beat	999
	the honest men and hang up them.	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Now, God help thee, poor monkey!	999
	But how wilt thou do for a father?	999
	999
Son	If he were dead, you'ld weep for	999
	him: if you would not, it were a good sign	999
	that I should quickly have a new father.	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,	999
	Though in your state of honour I am perfect.	999
	I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:	999
	If you will take a homely man's advice,	999
	Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.	999
	To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;	999
	To do worse to you were fell cruelty,	999
	Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!	999
	I dare abide no longer.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	Whither should I fly?	999
	I have done no harm. But I remember now	999
	I am in this earthly world; where to do harm	999
	Is often laudable, to do good sometime	999
	Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,	999
	Do I put up that womanly defence,	999
	To say I have done no harm?	999
	999
	[Enter Murderers]	999
	999
		      What are these faces?	999
	999
First Murderer	Where is your husband?	999
	999
LADY MACDUFF	I hope, in no place so unsanctified	999
	Where such as thou mayst find him.	999
	999
First Murderer	He's a traitor.	999
	999
Son	Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!	999
	999
First Murderer	What, you egg!	999
	999
	[Stabbing him]	999
	999
	Young fry of treachery!	999
	999
Son	He has kill'd me, mother:	999
	Run away, I pray you!	999

	999
SCENE III	England. Before the King's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter MALCOLM and MACDUFF]	999
	999
MALCOLM	Let us seek out some desolate shade, and there	999
	Weep our sad bosoms empty.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Let us rather	999
	Hold fast the mortal sword, and like good men	999
	Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn	999
	New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows	999
	Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds	999
	As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out	999
	Like syllable of dolour.	999
	999
MALCOLM	What I believe I'll wail,	999
	What know believe, and what I can redress,	999
	As I shall find the time to friend, I will.	999
	What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.	999
	This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,	999
	Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.	999
	He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;	999
	but something	999
	You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom	999
	To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb	999
	To appease an angry god.	999
	999
MACDUFF	I am not treacherous.	999
	999
MALCOLM	But Macbeth is.	999
	A good and virtuous nature may recoil	999
	In an imperial charge. But I shall crave	999
	your pardon;	999
	That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:	999
	Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;	999
	Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,	999
	Yet grace must still look so.	999
	999
MACDUFF	I have lost my hopes.	999
	999
MALCOLM	Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.	999
	Why in that rawness left you wife and child,	999
	Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,	999
	Without leave-taking? I pray you,	999
	Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,	999
	But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,	999
	Whatever I shall think.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Bleed, bleed, poor country!	999
	Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,	999
	For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou	999
	thy wrongs;	999
	The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:	999
	I would not be the villain that thou think'st	999
	For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,	999
	And the rich East to boot.	999
	999
MALCOLM	Be not offended:	999
	I speak not as in absolute fear of you.	999
	I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;	999
	It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash	999
	Is added to her wounds: I think withal	999
	There would be hands uplifted in my right;	999
	And here from gracious England have I offer	999
	Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,	999
	When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,	999
	Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country	999
	Shall have more vices than it had before,	999
	More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,	999
	By him that shall succeed.	999
	999
MACDUFF	What should he be?	999
	999
MALCOLM	It is myself I mean: in whom I know	999
	All the particulars of vice so grafted	999
	That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth	999
	Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state	999
	Esteem him as a lamb, being compared	999
	With my confineless harms.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Not in the legions	999
	Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd	999
	In evils to top Macbeth.	999
	999
MALCOLM	I grant him bloody,	999
	Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,	999
	Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin	999
	That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,	999
	In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,	999
	Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up	999
	The cistern of my lust, and my desire	999
	All continent impediments would o'erbear	999
	That did oppose my will: better Macbeth	999
	Than such an one to reign.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Boundless intemperance	999
	In nature is a tyranny; it hath been	999
	The untimely emptying of the happy throne	999
	And fall of many kings. But fear not yet	999
	To take upon you what is yours: you may	999
	Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,	999
	And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.	999
	We have willing dames enough: there cannot be	999
	That vulture in you, to devour so many	999
	As will to greatness dedicate themselves,	999
	Finding it so inclined.	999
	999
MALCOLM	With this there grows	999
	In my most ill-composed affection such	999
	A stanchless avarice that, were I king,	999
	I should cut off the nobles for their lands,	999
	Desire his jewels and this other's house:	999
	And my more-having would be as a sauce	999
	To make me hunger more; that I should forge	999
	Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,	999
	Destroying them for wealth.	999
	999
MACDUFF	This avarice	999
	Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root	999
	Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been	999
	The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;	999
	Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.	999
	Of your mere own: all these are portable,	999
	With other graces weigh'd.	999
	999
MALCOLM	But I have none: the king-becoming graces,	999
	As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,	999
	Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,	999
	Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,	999
	I have no relish of them, but abound	999
	In the division of each several crime,	999
	Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should	999
	Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,	999
	Uproar the universal peace, confound	999
	All unity on earth.	999
	999
MACDUFF	O Scotland, Scotland!	999
	999
MALCOLM	If such a one be fit to govern, speak:	999
	I am as I have spoken.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Fit to govern!	999
	No, not to live. O nation miserable,	999
	With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,	999
	When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,	999
	Since that the truest issue of thy throne	999
	By his own interdiction stands accursed,	999
	And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father	999
	Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,	999
	Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,	999
	Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!	999
	These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself	999
	Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,	999
	Thy hope ends here!	999
	999
MALCOLM	Macduff, this noble passion,	999
	Child of integrity, hath from my soul	999
	Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts	999
	To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth	999
	By many of these trains hath sought to win me	999
	Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me	999
	From over-credulous haste: but God above	999
	Deal between thee and me! for even now	999
	I put myself to thy direction, and	999
	Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure	999
	The taints and blames I laid upon myself,	999
	For strangers to my nature. I am yet	999
	Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,	999
	Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,	999
	At no time broke my faith, would not betray	999
	The devil to his fellow and delight	999
	No less in truth than life: my first false speaking	999
	Was this upon myself: what I am truly,	999
	Is thine and my poor country's to command:	999
	Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,	999
	Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,	999
	Already at a point, was setting forth.	999
	Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness	999
	Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?	999
	999
MACDUFF	Such welcome and unwelcome things at once	999
	'Tis hard to reconcile.	999
	999
	[Enter a Doctor]	999
	999
MALCOLM	Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?	999
	999
Doctor	Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls	999
	That stay his cure: their malady convinces	999
	The great assay of art; but at his touch--	999
	Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--	999
	They presently amend.	999
	999
MALCOLM	I thank you, doctor.	999
	999
	[Exit Doctor]	999
	999
MACDUFF	What's the disease he means?	999
	999
MALCOLM	'Tis call'd the evil:	999
	A most miraculous work in this good king;	999
	Which often, since my here-remain in England,	999
	I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,	999
	Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,	999
	All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,	999
	The mere despair of surgery, he cures,	999
	Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,	999
	Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,	999
	To the succeeding royalty he leaves	999
	The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,	999
	He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,	999
	And sundry blessings hang about his throne,	999
	That speak him full of grace.	999
	999
	[Enter ROSS]	999
	999
MACDUFF	See, who comes here?	999
	999
MALCOLM	My countryman; but yet I know him not.	999
	999
MACDUFF	My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.	999
	999
MALCOLM	I know him now. Good God, betimes remove	999
	The means that makes us strangers!	999
	999
ROSS	Sir, amen.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Stands Scotland where it did?	999
	999
ROSS	Alas, poor country!	999
	Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot	999
	Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,	999
	But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;	999
	Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air	999
	Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems	999
	A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell	999
	Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives	999
	Expire before the flowers in their caps,	999
	Dying or ere they sicken.	999
	999
MACDUFF	O, relation	999
	Too nice, and yet too true!	999
	999
MALCOLM	What's the newest grief?	999
	999
ROSS	That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:	999
	Each minute teems a new one.	999
	999
MACDUFF	How does my wife?	999
	999
ROSS	Why, well.	999
	999
MACDUFF	         And all my children?	999
	999
ROSS	Well too.	999
	999
MACDUFF	The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?	999
	999
ROSS	No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.	999
	999
MACDUFF	But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?	999
	999
ROSS	When I came hither to transport the tidings,	999
	Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour	999
	Of many worthy fellows that were out;	999
	Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,	999
	For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:	999
	Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland	999
	Would create soldiers, make our women fight,	999
	To doff their dire distresses.	999
	999
MALCOLM	Be't their comfort	999
	We are coming thither: gracious England hath	999
	Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;	999
	An older and a better soldier none	999
	That Christendom gives out.	999
	999
ROSS	Would I could answer	999
	This comfort with the like! But I have words	999
	That would be howl'd out in the desert air,	999
	Where hearing should not latch them.	999
	999
MACDUFF	What concern they?	999
	The general cause? or is it a fee-grief	999
	Due to some single breast?	999
	999
ROSS	No mind that's honest	999
	But in it shares some woe; though the main part	999
	Pertains to you alone.	999
	999
MACDUFF	If it be mine,	999
	Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.	999
	999
ROSS	Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,	999
	Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound	999
	That ever yet they heard.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Hum! I guess at it.	999
	999
ROSS	Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes	999
	Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,	999
	Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,	999
	To add the death of you.	999
	999
MALCOLM	Merciful heaven!	999
	What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;	999
	Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak	999
	Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.	999
	999
MACDUFF	My children too?	999
	999
ROSS	                  Wife, children, servants, all	999
	That could be found.	999
	999
MACDUFF	And I must be from thence!	999
	My wife kill'd too?	999
	999
ROSS	I have said.	999
	999
MALCOLM	Be comforted:	999
	Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,	999
	To cure this deadly grief.	999
	999
MACDUFF	He has no children. All my pretty ones?	999
	Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?	999
	What, all my pretty chickens and their dam	999
	At one fell swoop?	999
	999
MALCOLM	Dispute it like a man.	999
	999
MACDUFF	I shall do so;	999
	But I must also feel it as a man:	999
	I cannot but remember such things were,	999
	That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,	999
	And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,	999
	They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,	999
	Not for their own demerits, but for mine,	999
	Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!	999
	999
MALCOLM	Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief	999
	Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.	999
	999
MACDUFF	O, I could play the woman with mine eyes	999
	And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,	999
	Cut short all intermission; front to front	999
	Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;	999
	Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,	999
	Heaven forgive him too!	999
	999
MALCOLM	This tune goes manly.	999
	Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;	999
	Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth	999
	Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above	999
	Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:	999

	999
	999
	[Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman]	999
	999
Doctor	I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive	999
	no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?	999
	999
Gentlewoman	Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen	999
	her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon	999
	her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,	999
	write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again	999
	return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.	999
	999
Doctor	A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once	999
	the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of	999
	watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her	999
	walking and other actual performances, what, at any	999
	time, have you heard her say?	999
	999
Gentlewoman	That, sir, which I will not report after her.	999
	999
Doctor	You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.	999
	999
Gentlewoman	Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to	999
	confirm my speech.	999
	999
	[Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper]	999
	999
	Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;	999
	and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.	999
	999
Doctor	How came she by that light?	999
	999
Gentlewoman	Why, it stood by her: she has light by her	999
	continually; 'tis her command.	999
	999
Doctor	You see, her eyes are open.	999
	999
Gentlewoman	Ay, but their sense is shut.	999
	999
Doctor	What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.	999
	999
Gentlewoman	It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus	999
	washing her hands: I have known her continue in	999
	this a quarter of an hour.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Yet here's a spot.	999
	999
Doctor	Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from	999
	her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,	999
	then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my	999
	lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we	999
	fear who knows it, when none can call our power to	999
	account?--Yet who would have thought the old man	999
	to have had so much blood in him.	999
	999
Doctor	Do you mark that?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--	999
	What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'	999
	that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with	999
	this starting.	999
	999
Doctor	Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.	999
	999
Gentlewoman	She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of	999
	that: heaven knows what she has known.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Here's the smell of the blood still: all the	999
	perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little	999
	hand. Oh, oh, oh!	999
	999
Doctor	What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.	999
	999
Gentlewoman	I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the	999
	dignity of the whole body.	999
	999
Doctor	Well, well, well,--	999
	999
Gentlewoman	Pray God it be, sir.	999
	999
Doctor	This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known	999
	those which have walked in their sleep who have died	999
	holily in their beds.	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so	999
	pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he	999
	cannot come out on's grave.	999
	999
Doctor	Even so?	999
	999
LADY MACBETH	To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:	999
	come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's	999
	done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
Doctor	Will she go now to bed?	999
	999
Gentlewoman	Directly.	999
	999
Doctor	Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds	999
	Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds	999
	To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:	999
	More needs she the divine than the physician.	999
	God, God forgive us all! Look after her;	999
	Remove from her the means of all annoyance,	999
	And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:	999
	My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.	999
	I think, but dare not speak.	999

	999
	999
	[Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS,	999
	LENNOX, and Soldiers]	999
	999
MENTEITH	The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,	999
	His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:	999
	Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes	999
	Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm	999
	Excite the mortified man.	999
	999
ANGUS	Near Birnam wood	999
	Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.	999
	999
CAITHNESS	Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?	999
	999
LENNOX	For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file	999
	Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,	999
	And many unrough youths that even now	999
	Protest their first of manhood.	999
	999
MENTEITH	What does the tyrant?	999
	999
CAITHNESS	Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:	999
	Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him	999
	Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,	999
	He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause	999
	Within the belt of rule.	999
	999
ANGUS	Now does he feel	999
	His secret murders sticking on his hands;	999
	Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;	999
	Those he commands move only in command,	999
	Nothing in love: now does he feel his title	999
	Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe	999
	Upon a dwarfish thief.	999
	999
MENTEITH	Who then shall blame	999
	His pester'd senses to recoil and start,	999
	When all that is within him does condemn	999
	Itself for being there?	999
	999
CAITHNESS	Well, march we on,	999
	To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:	999
	Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,	999
	And with him pour we in our country's purge	999
	Each drop of us.	999
	999
LENNOX	                  Or so much as it needs,	999
	To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.	999

MACBETH	Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:	999
	Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,	999
	I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?	999
	Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know	999
	All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:	999
	'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman	999
	Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,	999
	false thanes,	999
	And mingle with the English epicures:	999
	The mind I sway by and the heart I bear	999
	Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.	999

MACBETH	Geese, villain!	999
	999
Servant	Soldiers, sir.	999
	999
MACBETH	Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,	999
	Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?	999
	Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine	999
	Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?	999
	999
Servant	The English force, so please you.	999

MACBETH	Take thy face hence.	999

		Seyton!--I am sick at heart,	999
	When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push	999
	Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.	999
	I have lived long enough: my way of life	999
	Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;	999
	And that which should accompany old age,	999
	As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,	999
	I must not look to have; but, in their stead,	999
	Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,	999
	Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!	999
	999
	[Enter SEYTON]	999
	999
SEYTON	What is your gracious pleasure?	999
	999
MACBETH	What news more?	999
	999
SEYTON	All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.	999
	999
MACBETH	I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.	999
	Give me my armour.	999
	999
SEYTON	'Tis not needed yet.	999
	999
MACBETH	I'll put it on.	999
	Send out more horses; skirr the country round;	999
	Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.	999
	How does your patient, doctor?	999
	999
Doctor	Not so sick, my lord,	999
	As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,	999
	That keep her from her rest.	999
	999
MACBETH	Cure her of that.	999
	Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,	999
	Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,	999
	Raze out the written troubles of the brain	999
	And with some sweet oblivious antidote	999
	Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff	999
	Which weighs upon the heart?	999
	999
Doctor	Therein the patient	999
	Must minister to himself.	999
	999
MACBETH	Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.	999
	Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.	999
	Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.	999
	Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast	999
	The water of my land, find her disease,	999
	And purge it to a sound and pristine health,	999
	I would applaud thee to the very echo,	999
	That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--	999
	What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,	999
	Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?	999
	999
Doctor	Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation	999
	Makes us hear something.	999
	999
MACBETH	Bring it after me.	999
	I will not be afraid of death and bane,	999
	Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.	999

SIWARD	We learn no other but the confident tyrant	999

	999
MALCOLM	'Tis his main hope:	999
	For where there is advantage to be given,	999
	Both more and less have given him the revolt,	999
	And none serve with him but constrained things	999
	Whose hearts are absent too.	999

MACDUFF	Let our just censures	999

MACBETH	I have almost forgot the taste of fears;	999
	The time has been, my senses would have cool'd	999
	To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair	999
	Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir	999
	As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;	999
	Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts	999
	Cannot once start me.	999
	999
	[Re-enter SEYTON]	999
	999
		Wherefore was that cry?	999
	999
SEYTON	The queen, my lord, is dead.	999
	999
MACBETH	She should have died hereafter;	999
	There would have been a time for such a word.	999
	To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,	999
	Creeps in this petty pace from day to day	999
	To the last syllable of recorded time,	999
	And all our yesterdays have lighted fools	999
	The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!	999
	Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player	999
	That struts and frets his hour upon the stage	999
	And then is heard no more: it is a tale	999
	Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,	999
	Signifying nothing.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
	Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.	999
	999
Messenger	Gracious my lord,	999
	I should report that which I say I saw,	999
	But know not how to do it.	999
	999
MACBETH	Well, say, sir.	999
	999
Messenger	As I did stand my watch upon the hill,	999
	I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,	999
	The wood began to move.	999
	999
MACBETH	Liar and slave!	999
	999
Messenger	Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:	999
	Within this three mile may you see it coming;	999
	I say, a moving grove.	999
	999
MACBETH	If thou speak'st false,	999
	Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,	999
	Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,	999
	I care not if thou dost for me as much.	999
	I pull in resolution, and begin	999
	To doubt the equivocation of the fiend	999
	That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood	999
	Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood	999
	Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!	999
	If this which he avouches does appear,	999
	There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.	999
	I gin to be aweary of the sun,	999
	And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.	999
	Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!	999
	At least we'll die with harness on our back.	999

	and their Army, with boughs]	999
	999
MALCOLM	Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.	999
	And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,	999
	Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,	999
	Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we	999
	Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,	999
	According to our order.	999
	999
SIWARD	Fare you well.	999
	Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,	999
	Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,	999

	[Alarums. Enter MACBETH]	999
	999
MACBETH	They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,	999
	But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he	999
	That was not born of woman? Such a one	999
	Am I to fear, or none.	999
	999
	[Enter YOUNG SIWARD]	999
	999
YOUNG SIWARD	What is thy name?	999
	999
MACBETH	                  Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.	999
	999
YOUNG SIWARD	No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name	999
	Than any is in hell.	999
	999
MACBETH	My name's Macbeth.	999
	999
YOUNG SIWARD	The devil himself could not pronounce a title	999
	More hateful to mine ear.	999
	999
MACBETH	No, nor more fearful.	999
	999
YOUNG SIWARD	Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword	999
	I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.	999
	999
	[They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain]	999
	999
MACBETH	Thou wast born of woman	999
	But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,	999
	Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Alarums. Enter MACDUFF]	999
	999
MACDUFF	That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!	999
	If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,	999
	My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.	999
	I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms	999
	Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,	999
	Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge	999
	I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;	999
	By this great clatter, one of greatest note	999
	Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!	999
	And more I beg not.	999
	999
	[Exit. Alarums]	999
	999
	[Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD]	999
	999
SIWARD	This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:	999
	The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;	999
	The noble thanes do bravely in the war;	999
	The day almost itself professes yours,	999
	And little is to do.	999
	999
MALCOLM	We have met with foes	999

	999
MACBETH	Why should I play the Roman fool, and die	999
	On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes	999
	Do better upon them.	999
	999
	[Enter MACDUFF]	999
	999
MACDUFF	Turn, hell-hound, turn!	999
	999
MACBETH	Of all men else I have avoided thee:	999
	But get thee back; my soul is too much charged	999
	With blood of thine already.	999
	999
MACDUFF	I have no words:	999
	My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain	999
	Than terms can give thee out!	999
	999
	[They fight]	999
	999
MACBETH	Thou losest labour:	999
	As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air	999
	With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:	999
	Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;	999
	I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,	999
	To one of woman born.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Despair thy charm;	999
	And let the angel whom thou still hast served	999
	Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb	999
	Untimely ripp'd.	999
	999
MACBETH	Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,	999
	For it hath cow'd my better part of man!	999
	And be these juggling fiends no more believed,	999
	That palter with us in a double sense;	999
	That keep the word of promise to our ear,	999
	And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.	999
	999
MACDUFF	Then yield thee, coward,	999
	And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:	999
	We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,	999
	Painted on a pole, and underwrit,	999
	'Here may you see the tyrant.'	999
	999
MACBETH	I will not yield,	999
	To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,	999
	And to be baited with the rabble's curse.	999
	Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,	999
	And thou opposed, being of no woman born,	999
	Yet I will try the last. Before my body	999
	I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,	999
	And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'	999
	999
	[Exeunt, fighting. Alarums]	999
	999
	[Retreat. Flourish. Enter, with drum and colours,	999
	MALCOLM, SIWARD, ROSS, the other Thanes, and Soldiers]	999
	999
MALCOLM	I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.	999
	999
SIWARD	Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,	999
	So great a day as this is cheaply bought.	999
	999
MALCOLM	Macduff is missing, and your noble son.	999
	999
ROSS	Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:	999
	He only lived but till he was a man;	999
	The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd	999
	In the unshrinking station where he fought,	999
	But like a man he died.	999
	999
SIWARD	Then he is dead?	999
	999
ROSS	Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow	999
	Must not be measured by his worth, for then	999
	It hath no end.	999
	999
SIWARD	                  Had he his hurts before?	999
	999
ROSS	Ay, on the front.	999
	999
SIWARD	                  Why then, God's soldier be he!	999
	Had I as many sons as I have hairs,	999
	I would not wish them to a fairer death:	999
	And so, his knell is knoll'd.	999
	999
MALCOLM	He's worth more sorrow,	999
	And that I'll spend for him.	999
	999
SIWARD	He's worth no more	999
	They say he parted well, and paid his score:	999
	And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.	999
	999
	[Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head]	999
	999
MACDUFF	Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands	999
	The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:	999
	I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,	999
	That speak my salutation in their minds;	999
	Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:	999
	Hail, King of Scotland!	999
	999
ALL	Hail, King of Scotland!	999
	999
	[Flourish]	999

MALCOLM	We shall not spend a large expense of time	999
	Before we reckon with your several loves,	999
	And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,	999
	Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland	999
	In such an honour named. What's more to do,	999
	Which would be planted newly with the time,	999
	As calling home our exiled friends abroad	999
	That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;	999
	Producing forth the cruel ministers	999
	Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,	999
	Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands	999
	Took off her life; this, and what needful else	999
	That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,	999
	We will perform in measure, time and place:	999
	So, thanks to all at once and to each one,	999

	999
	999
	[Enter RODERIGO and IAGO]	999
	999
RODERIGO	Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly	999
	That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse	999
	As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.	999
	999
IAGO	'Sblood, but you will not hear me:	999
	If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.	999
	999
IAGO	Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,	999
	In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,	999
	Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,	999
	I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:	999
	But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,	999
	Evades them, with a bombast circumstance	999
	Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;	999
	And, in conclusion,	999
	Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,	999
	'I have already chose my officer.'	999
	And what was he?	999
	Forsooth, a great arithmetician,	999
	One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,	999
	A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;	999
	That never set a squadron in the field,	999
	Nor the division of a battle knows	999
	More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,	999
	Wherein the toged consuls can propose	999
	As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,	999
	Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:	999
	And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof	999
	At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds	999
	Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd	999
	By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,	999
	He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,	999
	And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.	999
	999
RODERIGO	By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.	999
	999
IAGO	Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,	999
	Preferment goes by letter and affection,	999
	And not by old gradation, where each second	999
	Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,	999
	Whether I in any just term am affined	999
	To love the Moor.	999
	999
RODERIGO	I would not follow him then.	999
	999
IAGO	O, sir, content you;	999
	I follow him to serve my turn upon him:	999
	We cannot all be masters, nor all masters	999
	Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark	999
	Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,	999
	That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,	999
	Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,	999
	For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:	999
	Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are	999
	Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,	999
	Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,	999
	And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,	999
	Do well thrive by them and when they have lined	999
	their coats	999
	Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;	999
	And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,	999
	It is as sure as you are Roderigo,	999
	Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:	999
	In following him, I follow but myself;	999
	Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,	999
	But seeming so, for my peculiar end:	999
	For when my outward action doth demonstrate	999
	The native act and figure of my heart	999
	In compliment extern, 'tis not long after	999
	But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve	999
	For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.	999
	999
RODERIGO	What a full fortune does the thicklips owe	999
	If he can carry't thus!	999
	999
IAGO	Call up her father,	999
	Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,	999
	Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,	999
	And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,	999
	Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,	999
	Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,	999
	As it may lose some colour.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.	999
	999
IAGO	Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell	999
	As when, by night and negligence, the fire	999
	Is spied in populous cities.	999
	999
RODERIGO	What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!	999
	999
IAGO	Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!	999
	Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!	999
	Thieves! thieves!	999
	999
	[BRABANTIO appears above, at a window]	999
	999
BRABANTIO	What is the reason of this terrible summons?	999
	What is the matter there?	999
	999
RODERIGO	Signior, is all your family within?	999
	999
IAGO	Are your doors lock'd?	999
	999
BRABANTIO	Why, wherefore ask you this?	999
	999
IAGO	'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on	999
	your gown;	999
	Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;	999
	Even now, now, very now, an old black ram	999
	Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;	999
	Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,	999
	Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:	999
	Arise, I say.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	                  What, have you lost your wits?	999
	999
RODERIGO	Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?	999
	999
BRABANTIO	Not I	what are you?	999
	999
RODERIGO	My name is Roderigo.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	The worser welcome:	999
	I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:	999
	In honest plainness thou hast heard me say	999
	My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,	999
	Being full of supper and distempering draughts,	999
	Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come	999
	To start my quiet.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Sir, sir, sir,--	999
	999
BRABANTIO	                  But thou must needs be sure	999
	My spirit and my place have in them power	999
	To make this bitter to thee.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Patience, good sir.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;	999
	My house is not a grange.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Most grave Brabantio,	999
	In simple and pure soul I come to you.	999
	999
IAGO	'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not	999
	serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to	999
	do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll	999
	have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;	999
	you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have	999
	coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	What profane wretch art thou?	999
	999
IAGO	I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter	999
	and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	Thou art a villain.	999
	999
IAGO	You are--a senator.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,	999
	If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,	999
	As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,	999
	At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,	999
	Transported, with no worse nor better guard	999
	But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,	999
	To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--	999
	If this be known to you and your allowance,	999
	We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;	999
	But if you know not this, my manners tell me	999
	We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe	999
	That, from the sense of all civility,	999
	I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:	999
	Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,	999
	I say again, hath made a gross revolt;	999
	Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes	999
	In an extravagant and wheeling stranger	999
	Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:	999
	If she be in her chamber or your house,	999
	Let loose on me the justice of the state	999
	For thus deluding you.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	Strike on the tinder, ho!	999
	Give me a taper! call up all my people!	999
	This accident is not unlike my dream:	999
	Belief of it oppresses me already.	999
	Light, I say! light!	999
	999
	[Exit above]	999
	999
IAGO	Farewell; for I must leave you:	999
	It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,	999
	To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--	999
	Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,	999
	However this may gall him with some cheque,	999
	Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd	999
	With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,	999
	Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,	999
	Another of his fathom they have none,	999
	To lead their business: in which regard,	999
	Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.	999
	Yet, for necessity of present life,	999
	I must show out a flag and sign of love,	999
	Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,	999
	Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;	999
	And there will I be with him. So, farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches]	999
	999
BRABANTIO	It is too true an evil: gone she is;	999
	And what's to come of my despised time	999
	Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,	999
	Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!	999
	With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!	999
	How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me	999
	Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:	999
	Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?	999
	999
RODERIGO	Truly, I think they are.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!	999
	Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds	999
	By what you see them act. Is there not charms	999
	By which the property of youth and maidhood	999
	May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,	999
	Of some such thing?	999
	999
RODERIGO	Yes, sir, I have indeed.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!	999
	Some one way, some another. Do you know	999
	Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?	999
	999
RODERIGO	I think I can discover him, if you please,	999
	To get good guard and go along with me.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;	999
	I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!	999
	And raise some special officers of night.	999
	On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.	999

SCENE II	Another street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches]	999
	999
IAGO	Though in the trade of war I have slain men,	999
	Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience	999
	To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity	999
	Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times	999
	I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.	999
	999
OTHELLO	'Tis better as it is.	999
	999
IAGO	Nay, but he prated,	999
	999
	And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms	999
	Against your honour	999
	That, with the little godliness I have,	999
	I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,	999
	Are you fast married? Be assured of this,	999
	That the magnifico is much beloved,	999
	And hath in his effect a voice potential	999
	As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;	999
	Or put upon you what restraint and grievance	999
	The law, with all his might to enforce it on,	999
	Will give him cable.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Let him do his spite:	999
	My services which I have done the signiory	999
	Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--	999
	Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,	999
	I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being	999
	From men of royal siege, and my demerits	999
	May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune	999
	As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,	999
	But that I love the gentle Desdemona,	999
	I would not my unhoused free condition	999
	Put into circumscription and confine	999
	For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?	999
	999
IAGO	Those are the raised father and his friends:	999
	You were best go in.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Not I	I must be found:	999
	My parts, my title and my perfect soul	999
	Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?	999
	999
IAGO	By Janus, I think no.	999
	999
	[Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches]	999
	999
OTHELLO	The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.	999
	The goodness of the night upon you, friends!	999
	What is the news?	999
	999
CASSIO	                  The duke does greet you, general,	999
	And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,	999
	Even on the instant.	999
	999
OTHELLO	What is the matter, think you?	999
	999
CASSIO	Something from Cyprus as I may divine:	999
	It is a business of some heat: the galleys	999
	Have sent a dozen sequent messengers	999
	This very night at one another's heels,	999
	And many of the consuls, raised and met,	999
	Are at the duke's already: you have been	999
	hotly call'd for;	999
	When, being not at your lodging to be found,	999
	The senate hath sent about three several guests	999
	To search you out.	999
	999
OTHELLO	'Tis well I am found by you.	999
	I will but spend a word here in the house,	999
	And go with you.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CASSIO	                  Ancient, what makes he here?	999
	999
IAGO	'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:	999
	If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.	999
	999
CASSIO	I do not understand.	999
	999
IAGO	He's married.	999
	999
CASSIO	To who?	999
	999
	[Re-enter OTHELLO]	999
	999
IAGO	Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Have with you.	999
	999
CASSIO	Here comes another troop to seek for you.	999
	999
IAGO	It is Brabantio. General, be advised;	999
	He comes to bad intent.	999
	999
	[Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with	999
	torches and weapons]	999
	999
OTHELLO	Holla! stand there!	999
	999
RODERIGO	Signior, it is the Moor.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	Down with him, thief!	999
	999
	[They draw on both sides]	999
	999
IAGO	You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.	999
	Good signior, you shall more command with years	999
	Than with your weapons.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?	999
	Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;	999
	For I'll refer me to all things of sense,	999
	If she in chains of magic were not bound,	999
	Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,	999
	So opposite to marriage that she shunned	999
	The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,	999
	Would ever have, to incur a general mock,	999
	Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom	999
	Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.	999
	Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense	999
	That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,	999
	Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals	999
	That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;	999
	'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.	999
	I therefore apprehend and do attach thee	999
	For an abuser of the world, a practiser	999
	Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.	999
	Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,	999
	Subdue him at his peril.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Hold your hands,	999
	Both you of my inclining, and the rest:	999
	Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it	999
	Without a prompter. Where will you that I go	999
	To answer this your charge?	999
	999
BRABANTIO	To prison, till fit time	999
	Of law and course of direct session	999
	Call thee to answer.	999
	999
OTHELLO	What if I do obey?	999
	How may the duke be therewith satisfied,	999
	Whose messengers are here about my side,	999
	Upon some present business of the state	999
	To bring me to him?	999
	999
First Officer	'Tis true, most worthy signior;	999
	The duke's in council and your noble self,	999
	I am sure, is sent for.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	How! the duke in council!	999
	In this time of the night! Bring him away:	999
	Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,	999
	Or any of my brothers of the state,	999
	Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;	999
	For if such actions may have passage free,	999
	Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.	999

SCENE III	A council-chamber.	999
	999
	999
	[The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers	999
	attending]	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	There is no composition in these news	999
	That gives them credit.	999
	999
First Senator	Indeed, they are disproportion'd;	999
	My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	And mine, a hundred and forty.	999
	999
Second Senator	And mine, two hundred:	999
	But though they jump not on a just account,--	999
	As in these cases, where the aim reports,	999
	'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm	999
	A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:	999
	I do not so secure me in the error,	999
	But the main article I do approve	999
	In fearful sense.	999
	999
Sailor	[Within]  What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!	999
	999
First Officer	A messenger from the galleys.	999
	999
	[Enter a Sailor]	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	Now, what's the business?	999
	999
Sailor	The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;	999
	So was I bid report here to the state	999
	By Signior Angelo.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	How say you by this change?	999
	999
First Senator	This cannot be,	999
	By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,	999
	To keep us in false gaze. When we consider	999
	The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,	999
	And let ourselves again but understand,	999
	That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,	999
	So may he with more facile question bear it,	999
	For that it stands not in such warlike brace,	999
	But altogether lacks the abilities	999
	That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,	999
	We must not think the Turk is so unskilful	999
	To leave that latest which concerns him first,	999
	Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,	999
	To wake and wage a danger profitless.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.	999
	999
First Officer	Here is more news.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,	999
	Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,	999
	Have there injointed them with an after fleet.	999
	999
First Senator	Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?	999
	999
Messenger	Of thirty sail: and now they do restem	999
	Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance	999
	Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,	999
	Your trusty and most valiant servitor,	999
	With his free duty recommends you thus,	999
	And prays you to believe him.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.	999
	Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?	999
	999
First Senator	He's now in Florence.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.	999
	999
First Senator	Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.	999
	999
	[Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers]	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you	999
	Against the general enemy Ottoman.	999
	999
	[To BRABANTIO]	999
	999
	I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;	999
	We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;	999
	Neither my place nor aught I heard of business	999
	Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care	999
	Take hold on me, for my particular grief	999
	Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature	999
	That it engluts and swallows other sorrows	999
	And it is still itself.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	Why, what's the matter?	999
	999
BRABANTIO	My daughter! O, my daughter!	999
	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	|	Dead?	999
Senator	|	999
	999
	999
BRABANTIO	Ay, to me;	999
	She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted	999
	By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;	999
	For nature so preposterously to err,	999
	Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,	999
	Sans witchcraft could not.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding	999
	Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself	999
	And you of her, the bloody book of law	999
	You shall yourself read in the bitter letter	999
	After your own sense, yea, though our proper son	999
	Stood in your action.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	Humbly I thank your grace.	999
	Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,	999
	Your special mandate for the state-affairs	999
	Hath hither brought.	999
	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	|	999
	|                 We are very sorry for't.	999
Senator	|	999
	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	[To OTHELLO]  What, in your own part, can you say to this?	999
	999
BRABANTIO	Nothing, but this is so.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,	999
	My very noble and approved good masters,	999
	That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,	999
	It is most true; true, I have married her:	999
	The very head and front of my offending	999
	Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,	999
	And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:	999
	For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,	999
	Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used	999
	Their dearest action in the tented field,	999
	And little of this great world can I speak,	999
	More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,	999
	And therefore little shall I grace my cause	999
	In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,	999
	I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver	999
	Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,	999
	What conjuration and what mighty magic,	999
	For such proceeding I am charged withal,	999
	I won his daughter.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	A maiden never bold;	999
	Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion	999
	Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,	999
	Of years, of country, credit, every thing,	999
	To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!	999
	It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect	999
	That will confess perfection so could err	999
	Against all rules of nature, and must be driven	999
	To find out practises of cunning hell,	999
	Why this should be. I therefore vouch again	999
	That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,	999
	Or with some dram conjured to this effect,	999
	He wrought upon her.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	To vouch this, is no proof,	999
	Without more wider and more overt test	999
	Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods	999
	Of modern seeming do prefer against him.	999
	999
First Senator	But, Othello, speak:	999
	Did you by indirect and forced courses	999
	Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?	999
	Or came it by request and such fair question	999
	As soul to soul affordeth?	999
	999
OTHELLO	I do beseech you,	999
	Send for the lady to the Sagittary,	999
	And let her speak of me before her father:	999
	If you do find me foul in her report,	999
	The trust, the office I do hold of you,	999
	Not only take away, but let your sentence	999
	Even fall upon my life.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	Fetch Desdemona hither.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.	999
	999
	[Exeunt IAGO and Attendants]	999
	999
	And, till she come, as truly as to heaven	999
	I do confess the vices of my blood,	999
	So justly to your grave ears I'll present	999
	How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,	999
	And she in mine.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	Say it, Othello.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Her father loved me; oft invited me;	999
	Still question'd me the story of my life,	999
	From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,	999
	That I have passed.	999
	I ran it through, even from my boyish days,	999
	To the very moment that he bade me tell it;	999
	Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,	999
	Of moving accidents by flood and field	999
	Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,	999
	Of being taken by the insolent foe	999
	And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence	999
	And portance in my travels' history:	999
	Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,	999
	Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven	999
	It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;	999
	And of the Cannibals that each other eat,	999
	The Anthropophagi and men whose heads	999
	Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear	999
	Would Desdemona seriously incline:	999
	But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:	999
	Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,	999
	She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear	999
	Devour up my discourse: which I observing,	999
	Took once a pliant hour, and found good means	999
	To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart	999
	That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,	999
	Whereof by parcels she had something heard,	999
	But not intentively: I did consent,	999
	And often did beguile her of her tears,	999
	When I did speak of some distressful stroke	999
	That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,	999
	She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:	999
	She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,	999
	'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:	999
	She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd	999
	That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,	999
	And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,	999
	I should but teach him how to tell my story.	999
	And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:	999
	She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,	999
	And I loved her that she did pity them.	999
	This only is the witchcraft I have used:	999
	Here comes the lady; let her witness it.	999
	999
	[Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants]	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	I think this tale would win my daughter too.	999
	Good Brabantio,	999
	Take up this mangled matter at the best:	999
	Men do their broken weapons rather use	999
	Than their bare hands.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	I pray you, hear her speak:	999
	If she confess that she was half the wooer,	999
	Destruction on my head, if my bad blame	999
	Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:	999
	Do you perceive in all this noble company	999
	Where most you owe obedience?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	My noble father,	999
	I do perceive here a divided duty:	999
	To you I am bound for life and education;	999
	My life and education both do learn me	999
	How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;	999
	I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,	999
	And so much duty as my mother show'd	999
	To you, preferring you before her father,	999
	So much I challenge that I may profess	999
	Due to the Moor my lord.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	God be wi' you! I have done.	999
	Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:	999
	I had rather to adopt a child than get it.	999
	Come hither, Moor:	999
	I here do give thee that with all my heart	999
	Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart	999
	I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,	999
	I am glad at soul I have no other child:	999
	For thy escape would teach me tyranny,	999
	To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,	999
	Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers	999
	Into your favour.	999
	When remedies are past, the griefs are ended	999
	By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.	999
	To mourn a mischief that is past and gone	999
	Is the next way to draw new mischief on.	999
	What cannot be preserved when fortune takes	999
	Patience her injury a mockery makes.	999
	The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;	999
	He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;	999
	We lose it not, so long as we can smile.	999
	He bears the sentence well that nothing bears	999
	But the free comfort which from thence he hears,	999
	But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow	999
	That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.	999
	These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,	999
	Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:	999
	But words are words; I never yet did hear	999
	That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.	999
	I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for	999
	Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best	999
	known to you; and though we have there a substitute	999
	of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a	999
	sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer	999
	voice on you: you must therefore be content to	999
	slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this	999
	more stubborn and boisterous expedition.	999
	999
OTHELLO	The tyrant custom, most grave senators,	999
	Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war	999
	My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise	999
	A natural and prompt alacrity	999
	I find in hardness, and do undertake	999
	These present wars against the Ottomites.	999
	Most humbly therefore bending to your state,	999
	I crave fit disposition for my wife.	999
	Due reference of place and exhibition,	999
	With such accommodation and besort	999
	As levels with her breeding.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	If you please,	999
	Be't at her father's.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	I'll not have it so.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Nor I.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	     Nor I; I would not there reside,	999
	To put my father in impatient thoughts	999
	By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,	999
	To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;	999
	And let me find a charter in your voice,	999
	To assist my simpleness.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	What would You, Desdemona?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	That I did love the Moor to live with him,	999
	My downright violence and storm of fortunes	999
	May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued	999
	Even to the very quality of my lord:	999
	I saw Othello's visage in his mind,	999
	And to his honour and his valiant parts	999
	Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.	999
	So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,	999
	A moth of peace, and he go to the war,	999
	The rites for which I love him are bereft me,	999
	And I a heavy interim shall support	999
	By his dear absence. Let me go with him.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Let her have your voices.	999
	Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,	999
	To please the palate of my appetite,	999
	Nor to comply with heat--the young affects	999
	In me defunct--and proper satisfaction.	999
	But to be free and bounteous to her mind:	999
	And heaven defend your good souls, that you think	999
	I will your serious and great business scant	999
	For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys	999
	Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness	999
	My speculative and officed instruments,	999
	That my disports corrupt and taint my business,	999
	Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,	999
	And all indign and base adversities	999
	Make head against my estimation!	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	Be it as you shall privately determine,	999
	Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,	999
	And speed must answer it.	999
	999
First Senator	You must away to-night.	999
	999
OTHELLO	With all my heart.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.	999
	Othello, leave some officer behind,	999
	And he shall our commission bring to you;	999
	With such things else of quality and respect	999
	As doth import you.	999
	999
OTHELLO	So please your grace, my ancient;	999
	A man he is of honest and trust:	999
	To his conveyance I assign my wife,	999
	With what else needful your good grace shall think	999
	To be sent after me.	999
	999
DUKE OF VENICE	Let it be so.	999
	Good night to every one.	999
	999
	[To BRABANTIO]	999
	999
		   And, noble signior,	999
	If virtue no delighted beauty lack,	999
	Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.	999
	999
First Senator	Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.	999
	999
BRABANTIO	Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:	999
	She has deceived her father, and may thee.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers, &c]	999
	999
OTHELLO	My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,	999
	My Desdemona must I leave to thee:	999
	I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:	999
	And bring them after in the best advantage.	999
	999
	Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour	999
	Of love, of worldly matters and direction,	999
	To spend with thee: we must obey the time.	999
	999
	[Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA]	999
	999
RODERIGO	Iago,--	999
	999
IAGO	What say'st thou, noble heart?	999
	999
RODERIGO	What will I do, thinkest thou?	999
	999
IAGO	Why, go to bed, and sleep.	999
	999
RODERIGO	I will incontinently drown myself.	999
	999
IAGO	If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,	999
	thou silly gentleman!	999
	999
RODERIGO	It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and	999
	then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.	999
	999
IAGO	O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four	999
	times seven years; and since I could distinguish	999
	betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man	999
	that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I	999
	would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I	999
	would change my humanity with a baboon.	999
	999
RODERIGO	What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so	999
	fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.	999
	999
IAGO	Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus	999
	or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which	999
	our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant	999
	nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up	999
	thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or	999
	distract it with many, either to have it sterile	999
	with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the	999
	power and corrigible authority of this lies in our	999
	wills. If the balance of our lives had not one	999
	scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the	999
	blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us	999
	to most preposterous conclusions: but we have	999
	reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal	999
	stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that	999
	you call love to be a sect or scion.	999
	999
RODERIGO	It cannot be.	999
	999
IAGO	It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of	999
	the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown	999
	cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy	999
	friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with	999
	cables of perdurable toughness; I could never	999
	better stead thee than now. Put money in thy	999
	purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with	999
	an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It	999
	cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her	999
	love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he	999
	his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou	999
	shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but	999
	money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in	999
	their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food	999
	that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be	999
	to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must	999
	change for youth: when she is sated with his body,	999
	she will find the error of her choice: she must	999
	have change, she must: therefore put money in thy	999
	purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a	999
	more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money	999
	thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt	999
	an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not	999
	too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou	999
	shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of	999
	drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek	999
	thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than	999
	to be drowned and go without her.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on	999
	the issue?	999
	999
IAGO	Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told	999
	thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I	999
	hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no	999
	less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge	999
	against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost	999
	thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many	999
	events in the womb of time which will be delivered.	999
	Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more	999
	of this to-morrow. Adieu.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Where shall we meet i' the morning?	999
	999
IAGO	At my lodging.	999
	999
RODERIGO	I'll be with thee betimes.	999
	999
IAGO	Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?	999
	999
RODERIGO	What say you?	999
	999
IAGO	No more of drowning, do you hear?	999
	999
RODERIGO	I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
IAGO	Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:	999
	For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,	999
	If I would time expend with such a snipe.	999
	But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:	999
	And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets	999
	He has done my office: I know not if't be true;	999
	But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,	999
	Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;	999
	The better shall my purpose work on him.	999
	Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:	999
	To get his place and to plume up my will	999
	In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--	999
	After some time, to abuse Othello's ear	999
	That he is too familiar with his wife.	999
	He hath a person and a smooth dispose	999
	To be suspected, framed to make women false.	999
	The Moor is of a free and open nature,	999
	That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,	999
	And will as tenderly be led by the nose	999
	As asses are.	999
	I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night	999
	Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen]	999
	999
MONTANO	What from the cape can you discern at sea?	999
	999
First Gentleman	Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;	999
	I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,	999
	Descry a sail.	999
	999
MONTANO	Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;	999
	A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:	999
	If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,	999
	What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,	999
	Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?	999
	999
Second Gentleman	A segregation of the Turkish fleet:	999
	999
	For do but stand upon the foaming shore,	999
	The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;	999
	The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,	999
	seems to cast water on the burning bear,	999
	And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:	999
	I never did like molestation view	999
	On the enchafed flood.	999
	999
MONTANO	If that the Turkish fleet	999
	Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:	999
	It is impossible they bear it out.	999
	999
	[Enter a third Gentleman]	999
	999
Third Gentleman	News, lads! our wars are done.	999
	The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,	999
	That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice	999
	Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance	999
	On most part of their fleet.	999
	999
MONTANO	How! is this true?	999
	999
Third Gentleman	The ship is here put in,	999
	A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,	999
	Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,	999
	Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,	999
	And is in full commission here for Cyprus.	999
	999
MONTANO	I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.	999
	999
Third Gentleman	But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort	999
	Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,	999
	And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted	999
	With foul and violent tempest.	999
	999
MONTANO	Pray heavens he be;	999
	For I have served him, and the man commands	999
	Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!	999
	As well to see the vessel that's come in	999
	As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,	999
	Even till we make the main and the aerial blue	999
	An indistinct regard.	999
	999
Third Gentleman	Come, let's do so:	999
	For every minute is expectancy	999
	Of more arrivance.	999
	999
	[Enter CASSIO]	999
	999
CASSIO	Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,	999
	That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens	999
	Give him defence against the elements,	999
	For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.	999
	999
MONTANO	Is he well shipp'd?	999
	999
CASSIO	His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot	999
	Of very expert and approved allowance;	999
	Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,	999
	Stand in bold cure.	999
	999
	[A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!']	999
	999
	[Enter a fourth Gentleman]	999
	999
CASSIO	What noise?	999
	999
Fourth Gentleman	The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea	999
	Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'	999
	999
CASSIO	My hopes do shape him for the governor.	999
	999
	[Guns heard]	999
	999
Second Gentlemen	They do discharge their shot of courtesy:	999
	Our friends at least.	999
	999
CASSIO	I pray you, sir, go forth,	999
	And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	I shall.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
MONTANO	But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?	999
	999
CASSIO	Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid	999
	That paragons description and wild fame;	999
	One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,	999
	And in the essential vesture of creation	999
	Does tire the ingener.	999
	999
	[Re-enter second Gentleman]	999
	999
	How now! who has put in?	999
	999
Second Gentleman	'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.	999
	999
CASSIO	Has had most favourable and happy speed:	999
	Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,	999
	The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--	999
	Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--	999
	As having sense of beauty, do omit	999
	Their mortal natures, letting go safely by	999
	The divine Desdemona.	999
	999
MONTANO	What is she?	999
	999
CASSIO	She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,	999
	Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,	999
	Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts	999
	A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,	999
	And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,	999
	That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,	999
	Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,	999
	Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits	999
	And bring all Cyprus comfort!	999
	999
	[Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and	999
	Attendants]	999
	999
		        O, behold,	999
	The riches of the ship is come on shore!	999
	Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.	999
	Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,	999
	Before, behind thee, and on every hand,	999
	Enwheel thee round!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I thank you, valiant Cassio.	999
	What tidings can you tell me of my lord?	999
	999
CASSIO	He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught	999
	But that he's well and will be shortly here.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	O, but I fear--How lost you company?	999
	999
CASSIO	The great contention of the sea and skies	999
	Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.	999
	999
	[Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard]	999
	999
Second Gentleman	They give their greeting to the citadel;	999
	This likewise is a friend.	999
	999
CASSIO	See for the news.	999
	999
	[Exit Gentleman]	999
	999
	Good ancient, you are welcome.	999
	999
	[To EMILIA]	999
	999
		         Welcome, mistress.	999
	Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,	999
	That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding	999
	That gives me this bold show of courtesy.	999
	999
	[Kissing her]	999
	999
IAGO	Sir, would she give you so much of her lips	999
	As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,	999
	You'll have enough.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Alas, she has no speech.	999
	999
IAGO	In faith, too much;	999
	I find it still, when I have list to sleep:	999
	Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,	999
	She puts her tongue a little in her heart,	999
	And chides with thinking.	999
	999
EMILIA	You have little cause to say so.	999
	999
IAGO	Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,	999
	Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,	999
	Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,	999
	Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	O, fie upon thee, slanderer!	999
	999
IAGO	Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:	999
	You rise to play and go to bed to work.	999
	999
EMILIA	You shall not write my praise.	999
	999
IAGO	No, let me not.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst	999
	praise me?	999
	999
IAGO	O gentle lady, do not put me to't;	999
	For I am nothing, if not critical.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?	999
	999
IAGO	Ay, madam.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I am not merry; but I do beguile	999
	The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.	999
	Come, how wouldst thou praise me?	999
	999
IAGO	I am about it; but indeed my invention	999
	Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;	999
	It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,	999
	And thus she is deliver'd.	999
	If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,	999
	The one's for use, the other useth it.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Well praised! How if she be black and witty?	999
	999
IAGO	If she be black, and thereto have a wit,	999
	She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Worse and worse.	999
	999
EMILIA	How if fair and foolish?	999
	999
IAGO	She never yet was foolish that was fair;	999
	For even her folly help'd her to an heir.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'	999
	the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for	999
	her that's foul and foolish?	999
	999
IAGO	There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,	999
	But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.	999
	But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving	999
	woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her	999
	merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?	999
	999
IAGO	She that was ever fair and never proud,	999
	Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,	999
	Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,	999
	Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'	999
	She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,	999
	Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,	999
	She that in wisdom never was so frail	999
	To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;	999
	She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,	999
	See suitors following and not look behind,	999
	She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--	999
	999
DESDEMONA	To do what?	999
	999
IAGO	To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn	999
	of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say	999
	you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal	999
	counsellor?	999
	999
CASSIO	He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in	999
	the soldier than in the scholar.	999
	999
IAGO	[Aside]  He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,	999
	whisper: with as little a web as this will I	999
	ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon	999
	her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.	999
	You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as	999
	these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had	999
	been better you had not kissed your three fingers so	999
	oft, which now again you are most apt to play the	999
	sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent	999
	courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers	999
	to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!	999
	999
	[Trumpet within]	999
	999
	The Moor! I know his trumpet.	999
	999
CASSIO	'Tis truly so.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Let's meet him and receive him.	999
	999
CASSIO	Lo, where he comes!	999
	999
	[Enter OTHELLO and Attendants]	999
	999
OTHELLO	O my fair warrior!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	                  My dear Othello!	999
	999
OTHELLO	It gives me wonder great as my content	999
	To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!	999
	If after every tempest come such calms,	999
	May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!	999
	And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas	999
	Olympus-high and duck again as low	999
	As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,	999
	'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,	999
	My soul hath her content so absolute	999
	That not another comfort like to this	999
	Succeeds in unknown fate.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	The heavens forbid	999
	But that our loves and comforts should increase,	999
	Even as our days do grow!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Amen to that, sweet powers!	999
	I cannot speak enough of this content;	999
	It stops me here; it is too much of joy:	999
	And this, and this, the greatest discords be	999
	999
	[Kissing her]	999
	999
	That e'er our hearts shall make!	999
	999
IAGO	[Aside]  O, you are well tuned now!	999
	But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,	999
	As honest as I am.	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  Come, let us to the castle.	999
	News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks	999
	are drown'd.	999
	How does my old acquaintance of this isle?	999
	Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;	999
	I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,	999
	I prattle out of fashion, and I dote	999
	In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,	999
	Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:	999
	Bring thou the master to the citadel;	999
	He is a good one, and his worthiness	999
	Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,	999
	Once more, well met at Cyprus.	999
	999
	[Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]	999
	999
IAGO	Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come	999
	hither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base	999
	men being in love have then a nobility in their	999
	natures more than is native to them--list me. The	999
	lieutenant tonight watches on the court of	999
	guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is	999
	directly in love with him.	999
	999
	999
RODERIGO	With him! why, 'tis not possible.	999
	999
IAGO	Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.	999
	Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,	999
	but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:	999
	and will she love him still for prating? let not	999
	thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;	999
	and what delight shall she have to look on the	999
	devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of	999
	sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to	999
	give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,	999
	sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which	999
	the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these	999
	required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will	999
	find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,	999
	disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will	999
	instruct her in it and compel her to some second	999
	choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most	999
	pregnant and unforced position--who stands so	999
	eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio	999
	does? a knave very voluble; no further	999
	conscionable than in putting on the mere form of	999
	civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing	999
	of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,	999
	none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a	999
	finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and	999
	counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never	999
	present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the	999
	knave is handsome, young, and hath all those	999
	requisites in him that folly and green minds look	999
	after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman	999
	hath found him already.	999
	999
RODERIGO	I cannot believe that in her; she's full of	999
	most blessed condition.	999
	999
IAGO	Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of	999
	grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never	999
	have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou	999
	not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst	999
	not mark that?	999
	999
RODERIGO	Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.	999
	999
IAGO	Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue	999
	to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met	999
	so near with their lips that their breaths embraced	999
	together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these	999
	mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes	999
	the master and main exercise, the incorporate	999
	conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I	999
	have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;	999
	for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows	999
	you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find	999
	some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking	999
	too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what	999
	other course you please, which the time shall more	999
	favourably minister.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Well.	999
	999
IAGO	Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply	999
	may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for	999
	even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to	999
	mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true	999
	taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So	999
	shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by	999
	the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the	999
	impediment most profitably removed, without the	999
	which there were no expectation of our prosperity.	999
	999
RODERIGO	I will do this, if I can bring it to any	999
	opportunity.	999
	999
IAGO	I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:	999
	I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Adieu.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
IAGO	That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;	999
	That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:	999
	The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,	999
	Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,	999
	And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona	999
	A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;	999
	Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure	999
	I stand accountant for as great a sin,	999
	But partly led to diet my revenge,	999
	For that I do suspect the lusty Moor	999
	Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof	999
	Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;	999
	And nothing can or shall content my soul	999
	Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,	999
	Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor	999
	At least into a jealousy so strong	999
	That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,	999
	If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash	999
	For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,	999
	I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,	999
	Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--	999
	For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--	999
	Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.	999
	For making him egregiously an ass	999
	And practising upon his peace and quiet	999
	Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:	999
	Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.	999

	999
Herald	It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant	999
	general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,	999
	importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,	999
	every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,	999
	some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and	999
	revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these	999
	beneficial news, it is the celebration of his	999
	nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be	999
	proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full	999

	999
	[Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and Attendants]	999
	999
OTHELLO	Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:	999
	Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,	999
	Not to outsport discretion.	999
	999
CASSIO	Iago hath direction what to do;	999
	But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye	999
	Will I look to't.	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  Iago is most honest.	999
	Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest	999
	Let me have speech with you.	999
	999
	[To DESDEMONA]	999
	999
		       Come, my dear love,	999
	The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;	999
	That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.	999
	Good night.	999
	999
	[Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]	999
	999
	[Enter IAGO]	999
	999
CASSIO	Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.	999
	999
IAGO	Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the	999
	clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love	999
	of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:	999
	he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and	999
	she is sport for Jove.	999
	999
CASSIO	She's a most exquisite lady.	999
	999
IAGO	And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.	999
	999
CASSIO	Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.	999
	999
IAGO	What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of	999
	provocation.	999
	999
CASSIO	An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.	999
	999
IAGO	And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?	999
	999
CASSIO	She is indeed perfection.	999
	999
IAGO	Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I	999
	have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace	999
	of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to	999
	the health of black Othello.	999
	999
CASSIO	Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and	999
	unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish	999
	courtesy would invent some other custom of	999
	entertainment.	999
	999
IAGO	O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for	999
	you.	999
	999
CASSIO	I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was	999
	craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation	999
	it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,	999
	and dare not task my weakness with any more.	999
	999
IAGO	What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants	999
	desire it.	999
	999
CASSIO	Where are they?	999
	999
IAGO	Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.	999
	999
CASSIO	I'll do't; but it dislikes me.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
IAGO	If I can fasten but one cup upon him,	999
	With that which he hath drunk to-night already,	999
	He'll be as full of quarrel and offence	999
	As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,	999
	Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,	999
	To Desdemona hath to-night caroused	999
	Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:	999
	Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,	999
	That hold their honours in a wary distance,	999
	The very elements of this warlike isle,	999
	Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,	999
	And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,	999
	Am I to put our Cassio in some action	999
	That may offend the isle.--But here they come:	999
	If consequence do but approve my dream,	999
	My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.	999
	999
	[Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen;	999
	servants following with wine]	999
	999
CASSIO	'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.	999
	999
MONTANO	Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am	999
	a soldier.	999
	999
IAGO	Some wine, ho!	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	And let me the canakin clink, clink;	999
	And let me the canakin clink	999
	A soldier's a man;	999
	A life's but a span;	999
	Why, then, let a soldier drink.	999
	Some wine, boys!	999
	999
CASSIO	'Fore God, an excellent song.	999
	999
IAGO	I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are	999
	most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and	999
	your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothing	999
	to your English.	999
	999
CASSIO	Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?	999
	999
IAGO	Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead	999
	drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he	999
	gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle	999
	can be filled.	999
	999
CASSIO	To the health of our general!	999
	999
MONTANO	I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.	999
	999
IAGO	O sweet England!	999
	King Stephen was a worthy peer,	999
	His breeches cost him but a crown;	999
	He held them sixpence all too dear,	999
	With that he call'd the tailor lown.	999
	He was a wight of high renown,	999
	And thou art but of low degree:	999
	'Tis pride that pulls the country down;	999
	Then take thine auld cloak about thee.	999
	Some wine, ho!	999
	999
CASSIO	Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.	999
	999
IAGO	Will you hear't again?	999
	999
CASSIO	No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that	999
	does those things. Well, God's above all; and there	999
	be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.	999
	999
IAGO	It's true, good lieutenant.	999
	999
CASSIO	For mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor	999
	any man of quality,--I hope to be saved.	999
	999
IAGO	And so do I too, lieutenant.	999
	999
CASSIO	Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the	999
	lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's	999
	have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive	999
	us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.	999
	Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my	999
	ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:	999
	I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and	999
	speak well enough.	999
	999
All	Excellent well.	999
	999
CASSIO	Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
MONTANO	To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.	999
	999
IAGO	You see this fellow that is gone before;	999
	He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar	999
	And give direction: and do but see his vice;	999
	'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,	999
	The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.	999
	I fear the trust Othello puts him in.	999
	On some odd time of his infirmity,	999
	Will shake this island.	999
	999
MONTANO	But is he often thus?	999
	999
IAGO	'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:	999
	He'll watch the horologe a double set,	999
	If drink rock not his cradle.	999
	999
MONTANO	It were well	999
	The general were put in mind of it.	999
	Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature	999
	Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,	999
	And looks not on his evils: is not this true?	999
	999
	[Enter RODERIGO]	999
	999
IAGO	[Aside to him]  How now, Roderigo!	999
	I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.	999
	999
	[Exit RODERIGO]	999
	999
MONTANO	And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor	999
	Should hazard such a place as his own second	999
	With one of an ingraft infirmity:	999
	It were an honest action to say	999
	So to the Moor.	999
	999
IAGO	                  Not I, for this fair island:	999
	I do love Cassio well; and would do much	999
	To cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?	999
	999
	[Cry within: 'Help! help!']	999
	999
	[Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO]	999
	999
CASSIO	You rogue! you rascal!	999
	999
MONTANO	What's the matter, lieutenant?	999
	999
CASSIO	A knave teach me my duty!	999
	I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Beat me!	999
	999
CASSIO	       Dost thou prate, rogue?	999
	999
	[Striking RODERIGO]	999
	999
MONTANO	Nay, good lieutenant;	999
	999
	[Staying him]	999
	999
	I pray you, sir, hold your hand.	999
	999
CASSIO	Let me go, sir,	999
	Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.	999
	999
MONTANO	Come, come,	999
		                  you're drunk.	999
	999
CASSIO	Drunk!	999
	999
	[They fight]	999
	999
IAGO	[Aside to RODERIGO]  Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.	999
	999
	[Exit RODERIGO]	999
	999
	Nay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;--	999
	Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir;	999
	Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!	999
	999
	[Bell rings]	999
	999
	Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!	999
	The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!	999
	You will be shamed for ever.	999
	999
	[Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants]	999
	999
OTHELLO	What is the matter here?	999
	999
MONTANO	'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.	999

	[Faints]	999
	999
OTHELLO	Hold, for your lives!	999
	999
IAGO	Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,--	999
	Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?	999
	Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?	999
	Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that	999
	Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?	999
	For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:	999
	He that stirs next to carve for his own rage	999
	Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.	999
	Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle	999
	From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?	999
	Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,	999
	Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.	999
	999
IAGO	I do not know: friends all but now, even now,	999
	In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom	999
	Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--	999
	As if some planet had unwitted men--	999
	Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,	999
	In opposition bloody. I cannot speak	999
	Any beginning to this peevish odds;	999
	And would in action glorious I had lost	999
	Those legs that brought me to a part of it!	999
	999
OTHELLO	How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?	999
	999
CASSIO	I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;	999
	The gravity and stillness of your youth	999
	The world hath noted, and your name is great	999
	In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,	999
	That you unlace your reputation thus	999
	And spend your rich opinion for the name	999
	Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.	999
	999
MONTANO	Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:	999
	Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--	999
	While I spare speech, which something now	999
	offends me,--	999
	Of all that I do know: nor know I aught	999
	By me that's said or done amiss this night;	999
	Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,	999
	And to defend ourselves it be a sin	999
	When violence assails us.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Now, by heaven,	999
	My blood begins my safer guides to rule;	999
	And passion, having my best judgment collied,	999
	Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,	999
	Or do but lift this arm, the best of you	999
	Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know	999
	How this foul rout began, who set it on;	999
	And he that is approved in this offence,	999
	Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,	999
	Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,	999
	Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,	999
	To manage private and domestic quarrel,	999
	In night, and on the court and guard of safety!	999
	'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?	999
	999
MONTANO	If partially affined, or leagued in office,	999
	Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,	999
	Thou art no soldier.	999
	999
IAGO	Touch me not so near:	999
	I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth	999
	Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;	999
	Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth	999
	Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.	999
	Montano and myself being in speech,	999
	There comes a fellow crying out for help:	999
	And Cassio following him with determined sword,	999
	To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman	999
	Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:	999
	Myself the crying fellow did pursue,	999
	Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--	999
	The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,	999
	Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather	999
	For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,	999
	And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night	999
	I ne'er might say before. When I came back--	999
	For this was brief--I found them close together,	999
	At blow and thrust; even as again they were	999
	When you yourself did part them.	999
	More of this matter cannot I report:	999
	But men are men; the best sometimes forget:	999
	Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,	999
	As men in rage strike those that wish them best,	999
	Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received	999
	From him that fled some strange indignity,	999
	Which patience could not pass.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I know, Iago,	999
	Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,	999
	Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee	999
	But never more be officer of mine.	999
	999
	[Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended]	999
	999
	Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!	999
	I'll make thee an example.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	What's the matter?	999
	999
OTHELLO	All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.	999
	Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:	999
	Lead him off.	999
	999
	[To MONTANO, who is led off]	999
	999
	Iago, look with care about the town,	999
	And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.	999
	Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life	999
	To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO]	999
	999
IAGO	What, are you hurt, lieutenant?	999
	999
CASSIO	Ay, past all surgery.	999
	999
IAGO	Marry, heaven forbid!	999
	999
CASSIO	Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost	999
	my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of	999
	myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,	999
	Iago, my reputation!	999
	999
IAGO	As I am an honest man, I thought you had received	999
	some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than	999
	in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false	999
	imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without	999
	deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,	999
	unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!	999
	there are ways to recover the general again: you	999
	are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in	999
	policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his	999
	offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue	999
	to him again, and he's yours.	999
	999
CASSIO	I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so	999
	good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so	999
	indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?	999
	and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse	999
	fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible	999
	spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,	999
	let us call thee devil!	999
	999
IAGO	What was he that you followed with your sword? What	999
	had he done to you?	999
	999
CASSIO	I know not.	999
	999
IAGO	Is't possible?	999
	999
CASSIO	I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;	999
	a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men	999
	should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away	999
	their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance	999
	revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!	999
	999
IAGO	Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus	999
	recovered?	999
	999
CASSIO	It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place	999
	to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me	999
	another, to make me frankly despise myself.	999
	999
IAGO	Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,	999
	the place, and the condition of this country	999
	stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;	999
	but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.	999
	999
CASSIO	I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me	999
	I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,	999
	such an answer would stop them all. To be now a	999
	sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a	999
	beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is	999
	unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.	999
	999
IAGO	Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,	999
	if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.	999
	And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.	999
	999
CASSIO	I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!	999
	999
IAGO	You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.	999
	I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife	999
	is now the general: may say so in this respect, for	999
	that he hath devoted and given up himself to the	999
	contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and	999
	graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune	999
	her help to put you in your place again: she is of	999
	so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,	999
	she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more	999
	than she is requested: this broken joint between	999
	you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my	999
	fortunes against any lay worth naming, this	999
	crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.	999
	999
CASSIO	You advise me well.	999
	999
IAGO	I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.	999
	999
CASSIO	I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will	999
	beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:	999
	I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.	999
	999
IAGO	You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I	999
	must to the watch.	999
	999
CASSIO: Good night, honest Iago.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
IAGO	And what's he then that says I play the villain?	999
	When this advice is free I give and honest,	999
	Probal to thinking and indeed the course	999
	To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy	999
	The inclining Desdemona to subdue	999
	In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful	999
	As the free elements. And then for her	999
	To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,	999
	All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,	999
	His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,	999
	That she may make, unmake, do what she list,	999
	Even as her appetite shall play the god	999
	With his weak function. How am I then a villain	999
	To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,	999
	Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!	999
	When devils will the blackest sins put on,	999
	They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,	999
	As I do now: for whiles this honest fool	999
	Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes	999
	And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,	999
	I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,	999
	That she repeals him for her body's lust;	999
	And by how much she strives to do him good,	999
	She shall undo her credit with the Moor.	999
	So will I turn her virtue into pitch,	999
	And out of her own goodness make the net	999
	That shall enmesh them all.	999
	999
	[Re-enter RODERIGO]	999
	999
		      How now, Roderigo!	999
	999
RODERIGO	I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that	999
	hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is	999
	almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well	999
	cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall	999
	have so much experience for my pains, and so, with	999
	no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.	999
	999
IAGO	How poor are they that have not patience!	999
	What wound did ever heal but by degrees?	999
	Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;	999
	And wit depends on dilatory time.	999
	Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.	999
	And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:	999
	Though other things grow fair against the sun,	999
	Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:	999
	Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;	999
	Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.	999
	Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:	999
	Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:	999
	Nay, get thee gone.	999
	999
	[Exit RODERIGO]	999
	999
	Two things are to be done:	999
	My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;	999
	I'll set her on;	999
	Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,	999
	And bring him jump when he may Cassio find	999
	Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way	999
	Dull not device by coldness and delay.	999

	[Enter Clown]	999
	999
Clown	Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,	999
	that they speak i' the nose thus?	999
	999
First Musician	How, sir, how!	999
	999
Clown	Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?	999
	999
First Musician	Ay, marry, are they, sir.	999
	999
Clown	O, thereby hangs a tail.	999
	999
First Musician	Whereby hangs a tale, sir?	999
	999
Clown	Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.	999
	But, masters, here's money for you: and the general	999
	so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's	999
	sake, to make no more noise with it.	999
	999
First Musician	Well, sir, we will not.	999
	999
Clown	If you have any music that may not be heard, to't	999
	again: but, as they say to hear music the general	999
	does not greatly care.	999
	999
First Musician	We have none such, sir.	999
	999
Clown	Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:	999
	go; vanish into air; away!	999

CASSIO	Dost thou hear, my honest friend?	999

Clown	No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.	999
	999
CASSIO	Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece	999
	of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends	999
	the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's	999
	one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:	999
	wilt thou do this?	999
	999
Clown	She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I	999
	shall seem to notify unto her.	999
	999
CASSIO	Do, good my friend.	999
	999
	[Exit Clown]	999

	In happy time, Iago.	999
	999
IAGO	You have not been a-bed, then?	999
	999
CASSIO	Why, no; the day had broke	999
	Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,	999
	To send in to your wife: my suit to her	999
	Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona	999
	Procure me some access.	999
	999
IAGO	I'll send her to you presently;	999
	And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor	999
	Out of the way, that your converse and business	999
	May be more free.	999
	999
CASSIO	I humbly thank you for't.	999

	999
EMILIA	Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry	999
	For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.	999
	The general and his wife are talking of it;	999
	And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,	999
	That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,	999
	And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom	999
	He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you	999
	And needs no other suitor but his likings	999
	To take the safest occasion by the front	999
	To bring you in again.	999
	999
CASSIO	Yet, I beseech you,	999
	If you think fit, or that it may be done,	999
	Give me advantage of some brief discourse	999
	With Desdemona alone.	999
	999
EMILIA	Pray you, come in;	999
	I will bestow you where you shall have time	999

DESDEMONA	Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do	999

	999
EMILIA	Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,	999
	As if the case were his.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,	999
	But I will have my lord and you again	999
	As friendly as you were.	999
	999
CASSIO	Bounteous madam,	999
	Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,	999
	He's never any thing but your true servant.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:	999
	You have known him long; and be you well assured	999
	He shall in strangeness stand no further off	999
	Than in a polite distance.	999
	999
CASSIO	Ay, but, lady,	999
	That policy may either last so long,	999
	Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,	999
	Or breed itself so out of circumstance,	999
	That, I being absent and my place supplied,	999
	My general will forget my love and service.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Do not doubt that; before Emilia here	999
	I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,	999
	If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it	999
	To the last article: my lord shall never rest;	999
	I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;	999
	His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;	999
	I'll intermingle every thing he does	999
	With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;	999
	For thy solicitor shall rather die	999
	Than give thy cause away.	999

EMILIA	Madam, here comes my lord.	999
	999
CASSIO	Madam, I'll take my leave.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Why, stay, and hear me speak.	999
	999
CASSIO	Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,	999
	Unfit for mine own purposes.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Well, do your discretion.	999
	999
	[Exit CASSIO]	999

IAGO	Ha! I like not that.	999

OTHELLO	What dost thou say?	999
	999
IAGO	Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?	999
	999
IAGO	Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,	999
	That he would steal away so guilty-like,	999
	Seeing you coming.	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  I do believe 'twas he.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	How now, my lord!	999
	I have been talking with a suitor here,	999
	A man that languishes in your displeasure.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Who is't you mean?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,	999
	If I have any grace or power to move you,	999
	His present reconciliation take;	999
	For if he be not one that truly loves you,	999
	That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,	999
	I have no judgment in an honest face:	999
	I prithee, call him back.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Went he hence now?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Ay, sooth; so humbled	999
	That he hath left part of his grief with me,	999
	To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	But shall't be shortly?	999
	999
OTHELLO	The sooner, sweet, for you.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Shall't be to-night at supper?	999
	999
OTHELLO	No, not to-night.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	To-morrow dinner, then?	999
	999
OTHELLO	I shall not dine at home;	999
	I meet the captains at the citadel.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;	999
	On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:	999
	I prithee, name the time, but let it not	999
	Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;	999
	And yet his trespass, in our common reason--	999
	Save that, they say, the wars must make examples	999
	Out of their best--is not almost a fault	999
	To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?	999
	Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,	999
	What you would ask me, that I should deny,	999
	Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,	999
	That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,	999
	When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,	999
	Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do	999
	To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--	999
	999
OTHELLO	Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;	999
	I will deny thee nothing.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Why, this is not a boon;	999
	'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,	999
	Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,	999
	Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit	999
	To your own person: nay, when I have a suit	999
	Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,	999
	It shall be full of poise and difficult weight	999
	And fearful to be granted.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I will deny thee nothing:	999
	Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,	999
	To leave me but a little to myself.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;	999
	Whate'er you be, I am obedient.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]	999
	999
OTHELLO	Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,	999
	But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,	999
	Chaos is come again.	999
	999
IAGO	My noble lord--	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  What dost thou say, Iago?	999
	999
IAGO	Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,	999
	Know of your love?	999
	999
OTHELLO	He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?	999
	999
IAGO	But for a satisfaction of my thought;	999
	No further harm.	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  Why of thy thought, Iago?	999
	999
IAGO	I did not think he had been acquainted with her.	999
	999
OTHELLO	O, yes; and went between us very oft.	999
	999
IAGO	Indeed!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?	999
	Is he not honest?	999
	999
IAGO	Honest, my lord!	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  Honest! ay, honest.	999
	999
IAGO	My lord, for aught I know.	999
	999
OTHELLO	What dost thou think?	999
	999
IAGO	Think, my lord!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Think, my lord!	999
	By heaven, he echoes me,	999
	As if there were some monster in his thought	999
	Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:	999
	I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,	999
	When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?	999
	And when I told thee he was of my counsel	999
	In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'	999
	And didst contract and purse thy brow together,	999
	As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain	999
	Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,	999
	Show me thy thought.	999
	999
IAGO	My lord, you know I love you.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I think thou dost;	999
	And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,	999
	And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,	999
	Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:	999
	For such things in a false disloyal knave	999
	Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just	999
	They are close delations, working from the heart	999
	That passion cannot rule.	999
	999
IAGO	For Michael Cassio,	999
	I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I think so too.	999
	999
IAGO	                  Men should be what they seem;	999
	Or those that be not, would they might seem none!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Certain, men should be what they seem.	999
	999
IAGO	Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Nay, yet there's more in this:	999
	I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,	999
	As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts	999
	The worst of words.	999
	999
IAGO	Good my lord, pardon me:	999
	Though I am bound to every act of duty,	999
	I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.	999
	Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;	999
	As where's that palace whereinto foul things	999
	Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,	999
	But some uncleanly apprehensions	999
	Keep leets and law-days and in session sit	999
	With meditations lawful?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,	999
	If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear	999
	A stranger to thy thoughts.	999
	999
IAGO	I do beseech you--	999
	Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,	999
	As, I confess, it is my nature's plague	999
	To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy	999
	Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,	999
	From one that so imperfectly conceits,	999
	Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble	999
	Out of his scattering and unsure observance.	999
	It were not for your quiet nor your good,	999
	Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,	999
	To let you know my thoughts.	999
	999
OTHELLO	What dost thou mean?	999
	999
IAGO	Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,	999
	Is the immediate jewel of their souls:	999
	Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;	999
	'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:	999
	But he that filches from me my good name	999
	Robs me of that which not enriches him	999
	And makes me poor indeed.	999
	999
OTHELLO	By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.	999
	999
IAGO	You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;	999
	Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Ha!	999
	999
IAGO	O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;	999
	It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock	999
	The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss	999
	Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;	999
	But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er	999
	Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!	999
	999
OTHELLO	O misery!	999
	999
IAGO	Poor and content is rich and rich enough,	999
	But riches fineless is as poor as winter	999
	To him that ever fears he shall be poor.	999
	Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend	999
	From jealousy!	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  Why, why is this?	999
	Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,	999
	To follow still the changes of the moon	999
	With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt	999
	Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,	999
	When I shall turn the business of my soul	999
	To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,	999
	Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous	999
	To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,	999
	Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;	999
	Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:	999
	Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw	999
	The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;	999
	For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;	999
	I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;	999
	And on the proof, there is no more but this,--	999
	Away at once with love or jealousy!	999
	999
IAGO	I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason	999
	To show the love and duty that I bear you	999
	With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,	999
	Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.	999
	Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;	999
	Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:	999
	I would not have your free and noble nature,	999
	Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:	999
	I know our country disposition well;	999
	In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks	999
	They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience	999
	Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Dost thou say so?	999
	999
IAGO	She did deceive her father, marrying you;	999
	And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,	999
	She loved them most.	999
	999
OTHELLO	And so she did.	999
	999
IAGO	Why, go to then;	999
	She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,	999
	To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-	999
	He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;	999
	I humbly do beseech you of your pardon	999
	For too much loving you.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I am bound to thee for ever.	999
	999
IAGO	I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Not a jot, not a jot.	999
	999
IAGO	I' faith, I fear it has.	999
	I hope you will consider what is spoke	999
	Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:	999
	I am to pray you not to strain my speech	999
	To grosser issues nor to larger reach	999
	Than to suspicion.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I will not.	999
	999
IAGO	          Should you do so, my lord,	999
	My speech should fall into such vile success	999
	As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--	999
	My lord, I see you're moved.	999
	999
OTHELLO	No, not much moved:	999
	I do not think but Desdemona's honest.	999
	999
IAGO	Long live she so! and long live you to think so!	999
	999
OTHELLO	And yet, how nature erring from itself,--	999
	999
IAGO	Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--	999
	Not to affect many proposed matches	999
	Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,	999
	Whereto we see in all things nature tends--	999
	Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,	999
	Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.	999
	But pardon me; I do not in position	999
	Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear	999
	Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,	999
	May fall to match you with her country forms	999
	And happily repent.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Farewell, farewell:	999
	If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;	999
	Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:	999
	999
IAGO	[Going]  My lord, I take my leave.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless	999
	Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.	999
	999
IAGO	[Returning]  My lord, I would I might entreat	999
	your honour	999
	To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:	999
	Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,	999
	For sure, he fills it up with great ability,	999
	Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,	999
	You shall by that perceive him and his means:	999
	Note, if your lady strain his entertainment	999
	With any strong or vehement importunity;	999
	Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,	999
	Let me be thought too busy in my fears--	999
	As worthy cause I have to fear I am--	999
	And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Fear not my government.	999
	999
IAGO	I once more take my leave.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
OTHELLO	This fellow's of exceeding honesty,	999
	And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,	999
	Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,	999
	Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,	999
	I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,	999
	To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black	999
	And have not those soft parts of conversation	999
	That chamberers have, or for I am declined	999
	Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--	999
	She's gone. I am abused; and my relief	999
	Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,	999
	That we can call these delicate creatures ours,	999
	And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,	999
	And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,	999
	Than keep a corner in the thing I love	999
	For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;	999
	Prerogatived are they less than the base;	999
	'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:	999
	Even then this forked plague is fated to us	999
	When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:	999
	999
	[Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA]	999
	999
	If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!	999
	I'll not believe't.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	How now, my dear Othello!	999
	Your dinner, and the generous islanders	999
	By you invited, do attend your presence.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I am to blame.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	                  Why do you speak so faintly?	999
	Are you not well?	999
	999
OTHELLO	I have a pain upon my forehead here.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:	999
	Let me but bind it hard, within this hour	999
	It will be well.	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  Your napkin is too little:	999
	999
	[He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops]	999
	999
	Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I am very sorry that you are not well.	999
	999
	[Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA]	999
	999
EMILIA	I am glad I have found this napkin:	999
	This was her first remembrance from the Moor:	999
	My wayward husband hath a hundred times	999
	Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,	999
	For he conjured her she should ever keep it,	999
	That she reserves it evermore about her	999
	To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,	999
	And give't Iago: what he will do with it	999
	Heaven knows, not I;	999
	I nothing but to please his fantasy.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Iago]	999
	999
IAGO	How now! what do you here alone?	999
	999
EMILIA	Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.	999
	999
IAGO	A thing for me? it is a common thing--	999
	999
EMILIA	Ha!	999
	999
IAGO	To have a foolish wife.	999
	999
EMILIA	O, is that all? What will you give me now	999
	For the same handkerchief?	999
	999
IAGO	What handkerchief?	999
	999
EMILIA	What handkerchief?	999
	Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;	999
	That which so often you did bid me steal.	999
	999
IAGO	Hast stol'n it from her?	999
	999
EMILIA	No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.	999
	And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.	999
	Look, here it is.	999
	999
IAGO	                  A good wench; give it me.	999
	999
EMILIA	What will you do with 't, that you have been	999
	so earnest	999
	To have me filch it?	999
	999
IAGO	[Snatching it]  Why, what's that to you?	999
	999
EMILIA	If it be not for some purpose of import,	999
	Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad	999
	When she shall lack it.	999
	999
IAGO	Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.	999
	Go, leave me.	999
	999
	[Exit EMILIA]	999
	999
	I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,	999
	And let him find it. Trifles light as air	999
	Are to the jealous confirmations strong	999
	As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.	999
	The Moor already changes with my poison:	999
	Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.	999
	Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,	999
	But with a little act upon the blood.	999
	Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:	999
	Look, where he comes!	999
	999
	[Re-enter OTHELLO]	999
	999
		Not poppy, nor mandragora,	999
	Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,	999
	Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep	999
	Which thou owedst yesterday.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Ha! ha! false to me?	999
	999
IAGO	Why, how now, general! no more of that.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:	999
	I swear 'tis better to be much abused	999
	Than but to know't a little.	999
	999
IAGO	How now, my lord!	999
	999
OTHELLO	What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?	999
	I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:	999
	I slept the next night well, was free and merry;	999
	I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:	999
	He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,	999
	Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.	999
	999
IAGO	I am sorry to hear this.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I had been happy, if the general camp,	999
	Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,	999
	So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever	999
	Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!	999
	Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,	999
	That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!	999
	Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,	999
	The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,	999
	The royal banner, and all quality,	999
	Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!	999
	And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats	999
	The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,	999
	Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!	999
	999
IAGO	Is't possible, my lord?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,	999
	Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:	999
	Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,	999
	Thou hadst been better have been born a dog	999
	Than answer my waked wrath!	999
	999
IAGO	Is't come to this?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,	999
	That the probation bear no hinge nor loop	999
	To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!	999
	999
IAGO	My noble lord,--	999
	999
OTHELLO	If thou dost slander her and torture me,	999
	Never pray more; abandon all remorse;	999
	On horror's head horrors accumulate;	999
	Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;	999
	For nothing canst thou to damnation add	999
	Greater than that.	999
	999
IAGO	                  O grace! O heaven forgive me!	999
	Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?	999
	God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.	999
	That livest to make thine honesty a vice!	999
	O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,	999
	To be direct and honest is not safe.	999
	I thank you for this profit; and from hence	999
	I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.	999
	999
IAGO	I should be wise, for honesty's a fool	999
	And loses that it works for.	999
	999
OTHELLO	By the world,	999
	I think my wife be honest and think she is not;	999
	I think that thou art just and think thou art not.	999
	I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh	999
	As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black	999
	As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,	999
	Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,	999
	I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!	999
	999
IAGO	I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:	999
	I do repent me that I put it to you.	999
	You would be satisfied?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Would! nay, I will.	999
	999
IAGO	And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?	999
	Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--	999
	Behold her topp'd?	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  Death and damnation! O!	999
	999
IAGO	It were a tedious difficulty, I think,	999
	To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,	999
	If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster	999
	More than their own! What then? how then?	999
	What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?	999
	It is impossible you should see this,	999
	Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,	999
	As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross	999
	As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,	999
	If imputation and strong circumstances,	999
	Which lead directly to the door of truth,	999
	Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Give me a living reason she's disloyal.	999
	999
IAGO	I do not like the office:	999
	But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,	999
	Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,	999
	I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;	999
	And, being troubled with a raging tooth,	999
	I could not sleep.	999
	There are a kind of men so loose of soul,	999
	That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:	999
	One of this kind is Cassio:	999
	In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,	999
	Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'	999
	And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,	999
	Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,	999
	As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots	999
	That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg	999
	Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then	999
	Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'	999
	999
OTHELLO	O monstrous! monstrous!	999
	999
IAGO	Nay, this was but his dream.	999
	999
OTHELLO	But this denoted a foregone conclusion:	999
	'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.	999
	999
IAGO	And this may help to thicken other proofs	999
	That do demonstrate thinly.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I'll tear her all to pieces.	999
	999
IAGO	Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;	999
	She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,	999
	Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief	999
	Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?	999
	999
OTHELLO	I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.	999
	999
IAGO	I know not that; but such a handkerchief--	999
	I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day	999
	See Cassio wipe his beard with.	999
	999
OTHELLO	If it be that--	999
	999
IAGO	If it be that, or any that was hers,	999
	It speaks against her with the other proofs.	999
	999
OTHELLO	O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!	999
	One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.	999
	Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;	999
	All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.	999
	'Tis gone.	999
	Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!	999
	Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne	999
	To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,	999
	For 'tis of aspics' tongues!	999
	999
IAGO	Yet be content.	999
	999
OTHELLO	O, blood, blood, blood!	999
	999
IAGO	Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,	999
	Whose icy current and compulsive course	999
	Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on	999
	To the Propontic and the Hellespont,	999
	Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,	999
	Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,	999
	Till that a capable and wide revenge	999
	Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,	999
	999
	[Kneels]	999
	999
	In the due reverence of a sacred vow	999
	I here engage my words.	999
	999
IAGO	Do not rise yet.	999
	999
	[Kneels]	999
	999
	Witness, you ever-burning lights above,	999
	You elements that clip us round about,	999
	Witness that here Iago doth give up	999
	The execution of his wit, hands, heart,	999
	To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,	999
	And to obey shall be in me remorse,	999
	What bloody business ever.	999
	999
	[They rise]	999
	999
OTHELLO	I greet thy love,	999
	Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,	999
	And will upon the instant put thee to't:	999
	Within these three days let me hear thee say	999
	That Cassio's not alive.	999
	999
IAGO	My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:	999
	But let her live.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!	999
	Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,	999
	To furnish me with some swift means of death	999
	For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.	999
	999
IAGO	I am your own for ever.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE IV	Before the castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown]	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?	999
	999
Clown	I dare not say he lies any where.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Why, man?	999
	999
Clown	He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,	999
	is stabbing.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Go to: where lodges he?	999
	999
Clown	To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Can any thing be made of this?	999
	999
Clown	I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a	999
	lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were	999
	to lie in mine own throat.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?	999
	999
Clown	I will catechise the world for him; that is, make	999
	questions, and by them answer.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have	999
	moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.	999
	999
Clown	To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and	999
	therefore I will attempt the doing it.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?	999
	999
EMILIA	I know not, madam.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse	999
	Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor	999
	Is true of mind and made of no such baseness	999
	As jealous creatures are, it were enough	999
	To put him to ill thinking.	999
	999
EMILIA	Is he not jealous?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Who, he? I think the sun where he was born	999
	Drew all such humours from him.	999
	999
EMILIA	Look, where he comes.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I will not leave him now till Cassio	999
	Be call'd to him.	999
	999
	[Enter OTHELLO]	999
	999
	How is't with you, my lord	999
	999
OTHELLO	Well, my good lady.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	O, hardness to dissemble!--	999
	How do you, Desdemona?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Well, my good lord.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.	999
	999
OTHELLO	This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:	999
	Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires	999
	A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,	999
	Much castigation, exercise devout;	999
	For here's a young and sweating devil here,	999
	That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,	999
	A frank one.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	                  You may, indeed, say so;	999
	For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.	999
	999
OTHELLO	A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;	999
	But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.	999
	999
OTHELLO	What promise, chuck?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;	999
	Lend me thy handkerchief.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Here, my lord.	999
	999
OTHELLO	That which I gave you.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I have it not about me.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Not?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	   No, indeed, my lord.	999
	999
OTHELLO	That is a fault.	999
	999
	That handkerchief	999
	Did an Egyptian to my mother give;	999
	She was a charmer, and could almost read	999
	The thoughts of people: she told her, while	999
	she kept it,	999
	'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father	999
	Entirely to her love, but if she lost it	999
	Or made gift of it, my father's eye	999
	Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt	999
	After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;	999
	And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,	999
	To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;	999
	Make it a darling like your precious eye;	999
	To lose't or give't away were such perdition	999
	As nothing else could match.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Is't possible?	999
	999
OTHELLO	'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:	999
	A sibyl, that had number'd in the world	999
	The sun to course two hundred compasses,	999
	In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;	999
	The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;	999
	And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful	999
	Conserved of maidens' hearts.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Indeed! is't true?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Most veritable; therefore look to't well.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Then would to God that I had never seen't!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Ha! wherefore?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Why do you speak so startingly and rash?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out	999
	o' the way?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Heaven bless us!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Say you?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	It is not lost; but what an if it were?	999
	999
OTHELLO	How!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I say, it is not lost.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Fetch't, let me see't.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.	999
	This is a trick to put me from my suit:	999
	Pray you, let Cassio be received again.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Come, come;	999
	You'll never meet a more sufficient man.	999
	999
OTHELLO	The handkerchief!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	                  I pray, talk me of Cassio.	999
	999
OTHELLO	The handkerchief!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	                  A man that all his time	999
	Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,	999
	Shared dangers with you,--	999
	999
OTHELLO	The handkerchief!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	In sooth, you are to blame.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Away!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
EMILIA	Is not this man jealous?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I ne'er saw this before.	999
	Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:	999
	I am most unhappy in the loss of it.	999
	999
EMILIA	'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:	999
	They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;	999
	To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,	999
	They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!	999
	999
	[Enter CASSIO and IAGO]	999
	999
IAGO	There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:	999
	And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?	999
	999
CASSIO	Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you	999
	That by your virtuous means I may again	999
	Exist, and be a member of his love	999
	Whom I with all the office of my heart	999
	Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.	999
	If my offence be of such mortal kind	999
	That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,	999
	Nor purposed merit in futurity,	999
	Can ransom me into his love again,	999
	But to know so must be my benefit;	999
	So shall I clothe me in a forced content,	999
	And shut myself up in some other course,	999
	To fortune's alms.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	                  Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!	999
	My advocation is not now in tune;	999
	My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,	999
	Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.	999
	So help me every spirit sanctified,	999
	As I have spoken for you all my best	999
	And stood within the blank of his displeasure	999
	For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:	999
	What I can do I will; and more I will	999
	Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.	999
	999
IAGO	Is my lord angry?	999
	999
EMILIA	                  He went hence but now,	999
	And certainly in strange unquietness.	999
	999
IAGO	Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,	999
	When it hath blown his ranks into the air,	999
	And, like the devil, from his very arm	999
	Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?	999
	Something of moment then: I will go meet him:	999
	There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I prithee, do so.	999
	999
	[Exit IAGO]	999
	999
	Something, sure, of state,	999
	Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise	999
	Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,	999
	Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases	999
	Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,	999
	Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;	999
	For let our finger ache, and it indues	999
	Our other healthful members even to that sense	999
	Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,	999
	Nor of them look for such observances	999
	As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,	999
	I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,	999
	Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;	999
	But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,	999
	And he's indicted falsely.	999
	999
EMILIA	Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,	999
	And no conception nor no jealous toy	999
	Concerning you.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Alas the day! I never gave him cause.	999
	999
EMILIA	But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;	999
	They are not ever jealous for the cause,	999
	But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster	999
	Begot upon itself, born on itself.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!	999
	999
EMILIA	Lady, amen.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:	999
	If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit	999
	And seek to effect it to my uttermost.	999
	999
CASSIO	I humbly thank your ladyship.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]	999
	999
	[Enter BIANCA]	999
	999
BIANCA	Save you, friend Cassio!	999
	999
CASSIO	What make you from home?	999
	How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?	999
	I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.	999
	999
BIANCA	And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.	999
	What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?	999
	Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,	999
	More tedious than the dial eight score times?	999
	O weary reckoning!	999
	999
CASSIO	                  Pardon me, Bianca:	999
	I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:	999
	But I shall, in a more continuate time,	999
	Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,	999
	999
	[Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief]	999
	999
	Take me this work out.	999
	999
BIANCA	O Cassio, whence came this?	999
	This is some token from a newer friend:	999
	To the felt absence now I feel a cause:	999
	Is't come to this? Well, well.	999
	999
CASSIO	Go to, woman!	999
	Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,	999
	From whence you have them. You are jealous now	999
	That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:	999
	No, in good troth, Bianca.	999
	999
BIANCA	Why, whose is it?	999
	999
CASSIO	I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.	999
	I like the work well: ere it be demanded--	999
	As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:	999
	Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.	999
	999
BIANCA	Leave you! wherefore?	999
	999
CASSIO	I do attend here on the general;	999
	And think it no addition, nor my wish,	999
	To have him see me woman'd.	999
	999
BIANCA	Why, I pray you?	999
	999
CASSIO	Not that I love you not.	999
	999
BIANCA	But that you do not love me.	999
	I pray you, bring me on the way a little,	999
	And say if I shall see you soon at night.	999
	999
CASSIO	'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;	999
	For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.	999
	999
BIANCA	'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.	999

ACT IV	999

	999
	999
SCENE I	Cyprus. Before the castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter OTHELLO and IAGO]	999
	999
IAGO	Will you think so?	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  Think so, Iago!	999
	999
IAGO	What,	999
	To kiss in private?	999
	999
OTHELLO	An unauthorized kiss.	999
	999
IAGO	Or to be naked with her friend in bed	999
	An hour or more, not meaning any harm?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!	999
	It is hypocrisy against the devil:	999
	They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,	999
	The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.	999
	999
IAGO	So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:	999
	But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--	999
	999
OTHELLO	What then?	999
	999
IAGO	Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,	999
	She may, I think, bestow't on any man.	999
	999
OTHELLO	She is protectress of her honour too:	999
	May she give that?	999
	999
IAGO	Her honour is an essence that's not seen;	999
	They have it very oft that have it not:	999
	But, for the handkerchief,--	999
	999
OTHELLO	By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.	999
	Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,	999
	As doth the raven o'er the infected house,	999
	Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.	999
	999
IAGO	Ay, what of that?	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  That's not so good now.	999
	999
IAGO	What,	999
	If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?	999
	Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,	999
	Who having, by their own importunate suit,	999
	Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,	999
	Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose	999
	But they must blab--	999
	999
OTHELLO	Hath he said any thing?	999
	999
IAGO	He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,	999
	No more than he'll unswear.	999
	999
OTHELLO	What hath he said?	999
	999
IAGO	'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.	999
	999
OTHELLO	What? what?	999
	999
IAGO	Lie--	999
	999
OTHELLO	    With her?	999
	999
IAGO	With her, on her; what you will.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when	999
	they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.	999
	--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To	999
	confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be	999
	hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.	999
	Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing	999
	passion without some instruction. It is not words	999
	that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.	999
	--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--	999
	999
	[Falls in a trance]	999
	999
IAGO	Work on,	999
	My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;	999
	And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,	999
	All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!	999
	My lord, I say! Othello!	999
	999
	[Enter CASSIO]	999
	999
		    How now, Cassio!	999
	999
CASSIO	What's the matter?	999
	999
IAGO	My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:	999
	This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.	999
	999
CASSIO	Rub him about the temples.	999
	999
IAGO	No, forbear;	999
	The lethargy must have his quiet course:	999
	If not, he foams at mouth and by and by	999
	Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:	999
	Do you withdraw yourself a little while,	999
	He will recover straight: when he is gone,	999
	I would on great occasion speak with you.	999
	999
	[Exit CASSIO]	999
	999
	How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Dost thou mock me?	999
	999
IAGO	                  I mock you! no, by heaven.	999
	Would you would bear your fortune like a man!	999
	999
OTHELLO	A horned man's a monster and a beast.	999
	999
IAGO	There's many a beast then in a populous city,	999
	And many a civil monster.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Did he confess it?	999
	999
IAGO	                  Good sir, be a man;	999
	Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked	999
	May draw with you: there's millions now alive	999
	That nightly lie in those unproper beds	999
	Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.	999
	O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,	999
	To lip a wanton in a secure couch,	999
	And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;	999
	And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.	999
	999
OTHELLO	O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.	999
	999
IAGO	Stand you awhile apart;	999
	Confine yourself but in a patient list.	999
	Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--	999
	A passion most unsuiting such a man--	999
	Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,	999
	And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,	999
	Bade him anon return and here speak with me;	999
	The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,	999
	And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,	999
	That dwell in every region of his face;	999
	For I will make him tell the tale anew,	999
	Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when	999
	He hath, and is again to cope your wife:	999
	I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;	999
	Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,	999
	And nothing of a man.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Dost thou hear, Iago?	999
	I will be found most cunning in my patience;	999
	But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.	999
	999
IAGO	That's not amiss;	999
	But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?	999
	999
	[OTHELLO retires]	999
	999
	Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,	999
	A housewife that by selling her desires	999
	Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature	999
	That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague	999
	To beguile many and be beguiled by one:	999
	He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain	999
	From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:	999
	999
	[Re-enter CASSIO]	999
	999
	As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;	999
	And his unbookish jealousy must construe	999
	Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,	999
	Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?	999
	999
CASSIO	The worser that you give me the addition	999
	Whose want even kills me.	999
	999
IAGO	Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.	999
	999
	[Speaking lower]	999
	999
	Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,	999
	How quickly should you speed!	999
	999
CASSIO	Alas, poor caitiff!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Look, how he laughs already!	999
	999
IAGO	I never knew woman love man so.	999
	999
CASSIO	Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.	999
	999
IAGO	Do you hear, Cassio?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Now he importunes him	999
	To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.	999
	999
IAGO	She gives it out that you shall marry hey:	999
	Do you intend it?	999
	999
CASSIO	Ha, ha, ha!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?	999
	999
CASSIO	I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some	999
	charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.	999
	Ha, ha, ha!	999
	999
OTHELLO	So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.	999
	999
IAGO	'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.	999
	999
CASSIO	Prithee, say true.	999
	999
IAGO	I am a very villain else.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Have you scored me? Well.	999
	999
CASSIO	This is the monkey's own giving out: she is	999
	persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and	999
	flattery, not out of my promise.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.	999
	999
CASSIO	She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.	999
	I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with	999
	certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,	999
	and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--	999
	999
OTHELLO	Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture	999
	imports it.	999
	999
CASSIO	So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,	999
	and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,	999
	I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall	999
	throw it to.	999
	999
CASSIO	Well, I must leave her company.	999
	999
IAGO	Before me! look, where she comes.	999
	999
CASSIO	'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.	999
	999
	[Enter BIANCA]	999
	999
	What do you mean by this haunting of me?	999
	999
BIANCA	Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you	999
	mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?	999
	I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the	999
	work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find	999
	it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!	999
	This is some minx's token, and I must take out the	999
	work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever	999
	you had it, I'll take out no work on't.	999
	999
CASSIO	How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!	999
	999
OTHELLO	By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!	999
	999
BIANCA	An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you	999
	will not, come when you are next prepared for.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
IAGO	After her, after her.	999
	999
CASSIO	'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.	999
	999
IAGO	Will you sup there?	999
	999
CASSIO	'Faith, I intend so.	999
	999
IAGO	Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain	999
	speak with you.	999
	999
CASSIO	Prithee, come; will you?	999
	999
IAGO	Go to; say no more.	999
	999
	[Exit CASSIO]	999
	999
OTHELLO	[Advancing]  How shall I murder him, Iago?	999
	999
IAGO	Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?	999
	999
OTHELLO	O Iago!	999
	999
IAGO	And did you see the handkerchief?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Was that mine?	999
	999
IAGO	Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the	999
	foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he	999
	hath given it his whore.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I would have him nine years a-killing.	999
	A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!	999
	999
IAGO	Nay, you must forget that.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;	999
	for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to	999
	stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the	999
	world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by	999
	an emperor's side and command him tasks.	999
	999
IAGO	Nay, that's not your way.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate	999
	with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she	999
	will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high	999
	and plenteous wit and invention:--	999
	999
IAGO	She's the worse for all this.	999
	999
OTHELLO	O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so	999
	gentle a condition!	999
	999
IAGO	Ay, too gentle.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!	999
	O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!	999
	999
IAGO	If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her	999
	patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes	999
	near nobody.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!	999
	999
IAGO	O, 'tis foul in her.	999
	999
OTHELLO	With mine officer!	999
	999
IAGO	That's fouler.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not	999
	expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty	999
	unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.	999
	999
IAGO	Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even	999
	the bed she hath contaminated.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.	999
	999
IAGO	And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you	999
	shall hear more by midnight.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Excellent good.	999
	999
	[A trumpet within]	999
	999
	What trumpet is that same?	999
	999
IAGO	Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico	999
	Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.	999
	999
	[Enter LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]	999
	999
LODOVICO	Save you, worthy general!	999
	999
OTHELLO	With all my heart, sir.	999
	999
LODOVICO	The duke and senators of Venice greet you.	999
	999
	[Gives him a letter]	999
	999
OTHELLO	I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.	999
	999
	[Opens the letter, and reads]	999
	999
DESDEMONA	And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?	999
	999
IAGO	I am very glad to see you, signior	999
	Welcome to Cyprus.	999
	999
LODOVICO	I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?	999
	999
IAGO	Lives, sir.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord	999
	An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Are you sure of that?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	My lord?	999
	999
OTHELLO	[Reads]  'This fail you not to do, as you will--'	999
	999
LODOVICO	He did not call; he's busy in the paper.	999
	Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	A most unhappy one: I would do much	999
	To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Fire and brimstone!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	My lord?	999
	999
OTHELLO	       Are you wise?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	What, is he angry?	999
	999
LODOVICO	                  May be the letter moved him;	999
	For, as I think, they do command him home,	999
	Deputing Cassio in his government.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Trust me, I am glad on't.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Indeed!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	My lord?	999
	999
OTHELLO	I am glad to see you mad.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Why, sweet Othello,--	999
	999
OTHELLO	[Striking her]  Devil!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I have not deserved this.	999
	999
LODOVICO	My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,	999
	Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:	999
	Make her amends; she weeps.	999
	999
OTHELLO	O devil, devil!	999
	If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,	999
	Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.	999
	Out of my sight!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I will not stay to offend you.	999
	999
	[Going]	999
	999
LODOVICO	Truly, an obedient lady:	999
	I do beseech your lordship, call her back.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Mistress!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	        My lord?	999
	999
OTHELLO	What would you with her, sir?	999
	999
LODOVICO	Who, I, my lord?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:	999
	Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,	999
	And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;	999
	And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,	999
	Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.	999
	Concerning this, sir,--O  well-painted passion!--	999
	I am commanded home. Get you away;	999
	I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,	999
	And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!	999
	999
	[Exit DESDEMONA]	999
	999
	Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,	999
	I do entreat that we may sup together:	999
	You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LODOVICO	Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate	999
	Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature	999
	Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue	999
	The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,	999
	Could neither graze nor pierce?	999
	999
IAGO	He is much changed.	999
	999
LODOVICO	Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?	999
	999
IAGO	He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure	999
	What he might be: if what he might he is not,	999
	I would to heaven he were!	999
	999
LODOVICO	What, strike his wife!	999
	999
IAGO	'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew	999
	That stroke would prove the worst!	999
	999
LODOVICO	Is it his use?	999
	Or did the letters work upon his blood,	999
	And new-create this fault?	999
	999
IAGO	Alas, alas!	999
	It is not honesty in me to speak	999
	What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,	999
	And his own courses will denote him so	999
	That I may save my speech: do but go after,	999
	And mark how he continues.	999
	999
LODOVICO	I am sorry that I am deceived in him.	999
	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	A room in the castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA]	999
	999
OTHELLO	You have seen nothing then?	999
	999
EMILIA	Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.	999
	999
EMILIA	But then I saw no harm, and then I heard	999
	Each syllable that breath made up between them.	999
	999
OTHELLO	What, did they never whisper?	999
	999
EMILIA	Never, my lord.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Nor send you out o' the way?	999
	999
EMILIA	Never.	999
	999
OTHELLO	To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?	999
	999
EMILIA	Never, my lord.	999
	999
OTHELLO	That's strange.	999
	999
EMILIA	I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,	999
	Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,	999
	Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.	999
	If any wretch have put this in your head,	999
	Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!	999
	For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,	999
	There's no man happy; the purest of their wives	999
	Is foul as slander.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Bid her come hither: go.	999
	999
	[Exit EMILIA]	999
	999
	She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd	999
	That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,	999
	A closet lock and key of villanous secrets	999
	And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.	999
	999
	[Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA]	999
	999
DESDEMONA	My lord, what is your will?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Pray, chuck, come hither.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	What is your pleasure?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Let me see your eyes;	999
	Look in my face.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	                  What horrible fancy's this?	999
	999
OTHELLO	[To EMILIA]  Some of your function, mistress;	999
	Leave procreants alone and shut the door;	999
	Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:	999
	Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.	999
	999
	[Exit EMILIA]	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?	999
	I understand a fury in your words.	999
	But not the words.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Why, what art thou?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Your wife, my lord; your true	999
	And loyal wife.	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  Come, swear it, damn thyself	999
	Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves	999
	Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:	999
	Swear thou art honest.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Heaven doth truly know it.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?	999
	999
OTHELLO	O Desdemona! away! away! away!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?	999
	Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?	999
	If haply you my father do suspect	999
	An instrument of this your calling back,	999
	Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,	999
	Why, I have lost him too.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Had it pleased heaven	999
	To try me with affliction; had they rain'd	999
	All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.	999
	Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,	999
	Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,	999
	I should have found in some place of my soul	999
	A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me	999
	A fixed figure for the time of scorn	999
	To point his slow unmoving finger at!	999
	Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:	999
	But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,	999
	Where either I must live, or bear no life;	999
	The fountain from the which my current runs,	999
	Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!	999
	Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads	999
	To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,	999
	Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--	999
	Ay, there, look grim as hell!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.	999
	999
OTHELLO	O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,	999
	That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,	999
	Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet	999
	That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst	999
	ne'er been born!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,	999
	Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!	999
	Committed! O thou public commoner!	999
	I should make very forges of my cheeks,	999
	That would to cinders burn up modesty,	999
	Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!	999
	Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,	999
	The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets	999
	Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,	999
	And will not hear it. What committed!	999
	Impudent strumpet!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	                  By heaven, you do me wrong.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Are you not a strumpet?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	No, as I am a Christian:	999
	If to preserve this vessel for my lord	999
	From any other foul unlawful touch	999
	Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.	999
	999
OTHELLO	What, not a whore?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	                  No, as I shall be saved.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Is't possible?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	                  O, heaven forgive us!	999
	999
OTHELLO	I cry you mercy, then:	999
	I took you for that cunning whore of Venice	999
	That married with Othello.	999
	999
	[Raising his voice]	999
	999
		     You, mistress,	999
	That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,	999
	And keep the gate of hell!	999
	999
	[Re-enter EMILIA]	999
	999
		     You, you, ay, you!	999
	We have done our course; there's money for your pains:	999
	I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
EMILIA	Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?	999
	How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	'Faith, half asleep.	999
	999
EMILIA	Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	With who?	999
	999
EMILIA	Why, with my lord, madam.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Who is thy lord?	999
	999
EMILIA	                  He that is yours, sweet lady.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;	999
	I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,	999
	But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight	999
	Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;	999
	And call thy husband hither.	999
	999
EMILIA	Here's a change indeed!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DESDEMONA	'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.	999
	How have I been behaved, that he might stick	999
	The small'st opinion on my least misuse?	999
	999
	[Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO]	999
	999
IAGO	What is your pleasure, madam?	999
	How is't with you?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes	999
	Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:	999
	He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,	999
	I am a child to chiding.	999
	999
IAGO	What's the matter, lady?	999
	999
EMILIA	Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.	999
	Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,	999
	As true hearts cannot bear.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Am I that name, Iago?	999
	999
IAGO	What name, fair lady?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Such as she says my lord did say I was.	999
	999
EMILIA	He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink	999
	Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.	999
	999
IAGO	Why did he so?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I do not know; I am sure I am none such.	999
	999
IAGO	Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!	999
	999
EMILIA	Hath she forsook so many noble matches,	999
	Her father and her country and her friends,	999
	To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	It is my wretched fortune.	999
	999
IAGO	Beshrew him for't!	999
	How comes this trick upon him?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Nay, heaven doth know.	999
	999
EMILIA	I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,	999
	Some busy and insinuating rogue,	999
	Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,	999
	Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.	999
	999
IAGO	Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	If any such there be, heaven pardon him!	999
	999
EMILIA	A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!	999
	Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?	999
	What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?	999
	The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,	999
	Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.	999
	O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,	999
	And put in every honest hand a whip	999
	To lash the rascals naked through the world	999
	Even from the east to the west!	999
	999
IAGO	Speak within door.	999
	999
EMILIA	O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was	999
	That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,	999
	And made you to suspect me with the Moor.	999
	999
IAGO	You are a fool; go to.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	O good Iago,	999
	What shall I do to win my lord again?	999
	Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,	999
	I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:	999
	If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,	999
	Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,	999
	Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,	999
	Delighted them in any other form;	999
	Or that I do not yet, and ever did.	999
	And ever will--though he do shake me off	999
	To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,	999
	Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;	999
	And his unkindness may defeat my life,	999
	But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'	999
	It does abhor me now I speak the word;	999
	To do the act that might the addition earn	999
	Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.	999
	999
IAGO	I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:	999
	The business of the state does him offence,	999
	And he does chide with you.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	If 'twere no other--	999
	999
IAGO	'Tis but so, I warrant.	999
	999
	[Trumpets within]	999
	999
	Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!	999
	The messengers of Venice stay the meat;	999
	Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]	999
	999
	[Enter RODERIGO]	999
	999
	How now, Roderigo!	999
	999
RODERIGO	I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.	999
	999
IAGO	What in the contrary?	999
	999
RODERIGO	Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;	999
	and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me	999
	all conveniency than suppliest me with the least	999
	advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure	999
	it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what	999
	already I have foolishly suffered.	999
	999
IAGO	Will you hear me, Roderigo?	999
	999
RODERIGO	'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and	999
	performances are no kin together.	999
	999
IAGO	You charge me most unjustly.	999
	999
RODERIGO	With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of	999
	my means. The jewels you have had from me to	999
	deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a	999
	votarist: you have told me she hath received them	999
	and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden	999
	respect and acquaintance, but I find none.	999
	999
IAGO	Well; go to; very well.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis	999
	not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin	999
	to find myself fobbed in it.	999
	999
IAGO	Very well.	999
	999
RODERIGO	I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself	999
	known to Desdemona: if she will return me my	999
	jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my	999
	unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I	999
	will seek satisfaction of you.	999
	999
IAGO	You have said now.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.	999
	999
IAGO	Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from	999
	this instant to build on thee a better opinion than	999
	ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast	999
	taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I	999
	protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.	999
	999
RODERIGO	It hath not appeared.	999
	999
IAGO	I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your	999
	suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,	999
	Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I	999
	have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean	999
	purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if	999
	thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,	999
	take me from this world with treachery and devise	999
	engines for my life.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?	999
	999
IAGO	Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice	999
	to depute Cassio in Othello's place.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona	999
	return again to Venice.	999
	999
IAGO	O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with	999
	him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be	999
	lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be	999
	so determinate as the removing of Cassio.	999
	999
RODERIGO	How do you mean, removing of him?	999
	999
IAGO	Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;	999
	knocking out his brains.	999
	999
RODERIGO	And that you would have me to do?	999
	999
IAGO	Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.	999
	He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I	999
	go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable	999
	fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which	999
	I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,	999
	you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near	999
	to second your attempt, and he shall fall between	999
	us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with	999
	me; I will show you such a necessity in his death	999
	that you shall think yourself bound to put it on	999
	him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows	999
	to waste: about it.	999
	999
RODERIGO	I will hear further reason for this.	999
	999
IAGO	And you shall be satisfied.	999

	Attendants]	999
	999
LODOVICO	I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.	999
	999
OTHELLO	O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.	999
	999
LODOVICO	Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Your honour is most welcome.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Will you walk, sir?	999
	O,--Desdemona,--	999
	999
DESDEMONA	My lord?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned	999
	forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I will, my lord.	999
	999
	[Exeunt OTHELLO, LODOVICO, and Attendants]	999
	999
EMILIA	How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	He says he will return incontinent:	999
	He hath commanded me to go to bed,	999
	And bade me to dismiss you.	999
	999
EMILIA	Dismiss me!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.	999
	Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:	999
	We must not now displease him.	999
	999
EMILIA	I would you had never seen him!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	So would not I	my love doth so approve him,	999
	That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--	999
	Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.	999
	999
EMILIA	I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!	999
	If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me	999
	In one of those same sheets.	999
	999
EMILIA	Come, come you talk.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:	999
	She was in love, and he she loved proved mad	999
	And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'	999
	An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,	999
	And she died singing it: that song to-night	999
	Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,	999
	But to go hang my head all at one side,	999
	And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.	999
	999
EMILIA	Shall I go fetch your night-gown?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	No, unpin me here.	999
	This Lodovico is a proper man.	999
	999
EMILIA	A very handsome man.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	He speaks well.	999
	999
EMILIA	I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot	999
	to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	[Singing]  The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,	999
	Sing all a green willow:	999
	Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,	999
	Sing willow, willow, willow:	999
	The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;	999
	Sing willow, willow, willow;	999
	Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;	999
	Lay by these:--	999
	999
	[Singing]	999
	999
	Sing willow, willow, willow;	999
	Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--	999
	999
	[Singing]	999
	999
	Sing all a green willow must be my garland.	999
	Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-	999
	Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?	999
	999
EMILIA	It's the wind.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	[Singing]  I call'd my love false love; but what	999
	said he then?	999
	Sing willow, willow, willow:	999
	If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!	999
	So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;	999
	Doth that bode weeping?	999
	999
EMILIA	'Tis neither here nor there.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!	999
	Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--	999
	That there be women do abuse their husbands	999
	In such gross kind?	999
	999
EMILIA	There be some such, no question.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?	999
	999
EMILIA	Why, would not you?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	No, by this heavenly light!	999
	999
EMILIA	Nor I neither by this heavenly light;	999
	I might do't as well i' the dark.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?	999
	999
EMILIA	The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.	999
	For a small vice.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	In troth, I think thou wouldst not.	999
	999
EMILIA	In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had	999
	done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a	999
	joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for	999
	gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty	999
	exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would	999
	not make her husband a cuckold to make him a	999
	monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong	999
	For the whole world.	999
	999
EMILIA	Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and	999
	having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your	999
	own world, and you might quickly make it right.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I do not think there is any such woman.	999
	999
EMILIA	Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would	999
	store the world they played for.	999
	But I do think it is their husbands' faults	999
	If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,	999
	And pour our treasures into foreign laps,	999
	Or else break out in peevish jealousies,	999
	Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,	999
	Or scant our former having in despite;	999
	Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,	999
	Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know	999
	Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell	999
	And have their palates both for sweet and sour,	999
	As husbands have. What is it that they do	999
	When they change us for others? Is it sport?	999
	I think it is: and doth affection breed it?	999
	I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?	999
	It is so too: and have not we affections,	999
	Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?	999
	Then let them use us well: else let them know,	999
	The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,	999
	Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!	999

SCENE I	Cyprus. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter IAGO and RODERIGO]	999
	999
IAGO	Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:	999
	Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:	999
	Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:	999
	It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,	999
	And fix most firm thy resolution.	999
	999
RODERIGO	Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.	999
	999
IAGO	Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.	999
	999
	[Retires]	999
	999
RODERIGO	I have no great devotion to the deed;	999
	And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:	999
	'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.	999
	999
IAGO	I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,	999
	And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,	999
	Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,	999
	Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,	999
	He calls me to a restitution large	999
	Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,	999
	As gifts to Desdemona;	999
	It must not be: if Cassio do remain,	999
	He hath a daily beauty in his life	999
	That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor	999
	May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:	999
	No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.	999
	999
	[Enter CASSIO]	999
	999
RODERIGO	I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!	999
	999
	[Makes a pass at CASSIO]	999
	999
CASSIO	That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,	999
	But that my coat is better than thou know'st	999
	I will make proof of thine.	999
	999
	[Draws, and wounds RODERIGO]	999
	999
RODERIGO	O, I am slain!	999
	999
	[IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg, and exit]	999
	999

OTHELLO	The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.	999

CASSIO	O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!	999
	999
OTHELLO	'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just,	999

	Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,	999
	And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.	999
	Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;	999

RODERIGO	O wretched villain!	999
	999
LODOVICO	Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:	999
	These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe	999

	999
CASSIO	Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!	999
	999
IAGO	What's the matter?	999
	999
GRATIANO	This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.	999
	999
LODOVICO	The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.	999
	999
IAGO	What are you here that cry so grievously?	999
	999
CASSIO	Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!	999
	Give me some help.	999
	999
IAGO	O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?	999
	999
CASSIO	I think that one of them is hereabout,	999
	And cannot make away.	999
	999
IAGO	O treacherous villains!	999
	What are you there? come in, and give some help.	999
	999
	[To LODOVICO and GRATIANO]	999
	999
RODERIGO	O, help me here!	999
	999
CASSIO	That's one of them.	999
	999
IAGO	O murderous slave! O villain!	999
	999
	[Stabs RODERIGO]	999
	999
RODERIGO	O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!	999
	999
IAGO	Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--	999
	How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--	999
	What may you be? are you of good or evil?	999
	999
LODOVICO	As you shall prove us, praise us.	999
	999
IAGO	Signior Lodovico?	999
	999
LODOVICO	He, sir.	999
	999
IAGO	I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.	999
	999
GRATIANO	Cassio!	999
	999
IAGO	How is't, brother!	999
	999
CASSIO	My leg is cut in two.	999
	999
IAGO	Marry, heaven forbid!	999
	Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.	999
	999
	[Enter BIANCA]	999
	999
BIANCA	What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?	999
	999
IAGO	Who is't that cried!	999
	999
BIANCA	O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,	999
	Cassio, Cassio!	999
	999
IAGO	O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect	999
	Who they should be that have thus many led you?	999
	999
CASSIO	No.	999
	999
GRATIANO	I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.	999
	999
IAGO	Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,	999
	To bear him easily hence!	999
	999
BIANCA	Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!	999
	999
IAGO	Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash	999
	To be a party in this injury.	999
	Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;	999
	Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?	999
	Alas my friend and my dear countryman	999
	Roderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.	999
	999
GRATIANO	What, of Venice?	999
	999
IAGO	Even he, sir; did you know him?	999
	999
GRATIANO	Know him! ay.	999
	999
IAGO	Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;	999
	These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,	999
	That so neglected you.	999
	999
GRATIANO	I am glad to see you.	999
	999
IAGO	How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!	999
	999
GRATIANO	Roderigo!	999
	999
IAGO	He, he 'tis he.	999
	999
	[A chair brought in]	999
	999
	O, that's well said; the chair!	999
	999
GRATIANO	Some good man bear him carefully from hence;	999
	I'll fetch the general's surgeon.	999
	999
	[To BIANCA]	999
	999
		                  For you, mistress,	999
	Save you your labour. He that lies slain	999
	here, Cassio,	999
	Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?	999
	999
CASSIO	None in the world; nor do I know the man.	999
	999
IAGO	[To BIANCA]  What, look you pale? O, bear him out	999
	o' the air.	999
	999
	[CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off]	999
	999
	Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?	999
	Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?	999
	Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.	999
	Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:	999
	Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,	999
	Though tongues were out of use.	999
	999
	[Enter EMILIA]	999
	999
EMILIA	'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?	999
	999
IAGO	Cassio hath here been set on in the dark	999
	By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:	999
	He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.	999
	999
EMILIA	Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!	999
	999
IAGO	This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,	999
	Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.	999
	999
	[To BIANCA]	999
	999
	What, do you shake at that?	999
	999
BIANCA	He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.	999
	999
IAGO	O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.	999
	999
EMILIA	Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!	999
	999
BIANCA	I am no strumpet; but of life as honest	999
	As you that thus abuse me.	999
	999
EMILIA	As I! foh! fie upon thee!	999
	999
IAGO	Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.	999
	Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.	999
	Emilia run you to the citadel,	999
	And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.	999
	Will you go on? I pray.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
		   This is the night	999
	That either makes me or fordoes me quite.	999

ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	A bedchamber in the castle: DESDEMONA in bed asleep;	999
	a light burning.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter OTHELLO]	999
	999
OTHELLO	It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--	999
	Let me not name it to you, you chaste stars!--	999
	It is the cause. Yet I'll not shed her blood;	999
	Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,	999
	And smooth as monumental alabaster.	999
	Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.	999
	Put out the light, and then put out the light:	999
	If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,	999
	I can again thy former light restore,	999
	Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,	999
	Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,	999
	I know not where is that Promethean heat	999
	That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,	999
	I cannot give it vital growth again.	999
	It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.	999
	999
	[Kissing her]	999
	999
	Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade	999
	Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.	999
	Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,	999
	And love thee after. One more, and this the last:	999
	So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,	999
	But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;	999
	It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Who's there? Othello?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Ay. Desdemona.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Will you come to bed, my lord?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Ay, my lord.	999
	999
OTHELLO	If you bethink yourself of any crime	999
	Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,	999
	Solicit for it straight.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:	999
	I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;	999
	No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Talk you of killing?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Ay, I do.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Then heaven	999
	Have mercy on me!	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  Amen, with all my heart!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Hum!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then	999
	When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,	999
	Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Think on thy sins.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	                  They are loves I bear to you.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Ay, and for that thou diest.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	That death's unnatural that kills for loving.	999
	Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?	999
	Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:	999
	These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,	999
	They do not point on me.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Peace, and be still!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	I will so. What's the matter?	999
	999
OTHELLO	That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee	999
	Thou gavest to Cassio.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	No, by my life and soul!	999
	Send for the man, and ask him.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Sweet soul, take heed,	999
	Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Ay, but not yet to die.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Yes, presently:	999
	Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;	999
	For to deny each article with oath	999
	Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception	999
	That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Then Lord have mercy on me!	999
	999
OTHELLO	I say, amen.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	And have you mercy too! I never did	999
	Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio	999
	But with such general warranty of heaven	999
	As I might love: I never gave him token.	999
	999
OTHELLO	By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.	999
	O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,	999
	And makest me call what I intend to do	999
	A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:	999
	I saw the handkerchief.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	He found it then;	999
	I never gave it him: send for him hither;	999
	Let him confess a truth.	999
	999
OTHELLO	He hath confess'd.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	What, my lord?	999
	999
OTHELLO	That he hath used thee.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	How? unlawfully?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Ay.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	He will not say so.	999
	999
OTHELLO	No, his mouth is stopp'd;	999
	Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge	999
	Had stomach for them all.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Down, strumpet!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Nay, if you strive--	999
	999
DESDEMONA	But half an hour!	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  Being done, there is no pause.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	But while I say one prayer!	999
	999
OTHELLO	It is too late.	999
	999
	[He stifles her]	999
	999
EMILIA	[Within]  My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!	999
	999
OTHELLO	What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?	999
	I that am cruel am yet merciful;	999
	I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.	999
	999
EMILIA	[Within]  What, ho! my lord, my lord!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Who's there?	999
	999
EMILIA	[Within]  O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.	999
	'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--	999
	The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?	999
	Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--	999
	I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?	999
	If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:	999
	My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.	999
	O insupportable! O heavy hour!	999
	Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse	999
	Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe	999
	Should yawn at alteration.	999
	999
EMILIA	[Within]  I do beseech you	999
	That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!	999
	999
OTHELLO	I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;	999
	Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.	999
	Where art thou?	999
	999
	[Unlocks the door]	999
	999
	[Enter EMILIA]	999
	999
	What's the matter with thee now?	999
	999
EMILIA	O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!	999
	999
OTHELLO	What, now?	999
	999
EMILIA	But now, my lord.	999
	999
OTHELLO	It is the very error of the moon;	999
	She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,	999
	And makes men mad.	999
	999
EMILIA	Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian	999
	Call'd Roderigo.	999
	999
OTHELLO	                  Roderigo kill'd!	999
	And Cassio kill'd!	999
	999
EMILIA	No, Cassio is not kill'd.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,	999
	And sweet revenge grows harsh.	999
	999
DESDEMONA	O, falsely, falsely murder'd!	999
	999
EMILIA	Alas, what cry is that?	999
	999
OTHELLO	That! what?	999
	999
EMILIA	Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.	999
	Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!	999
	Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!	999
	999
DESDEMONA	A guiltless death I die.	999
	999
EMILIA	O, who hath done this deed?	999
	999
DESDEMONA	Nobody; I myself. Farewell	999
	Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
OTHELLO	Why, how should she be murder'd?	999
	999
EMILIA	Alas, who knows?	999
	999
OTHELLO	You heard her say herself, it was not I.	999
	999
EMILIA	She said so: I must needs report the truth.	999
	999
OTHELLO	She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:	999
	'Twas I that kill'd her.	999
	999
EMILIA	O, the more angel she,	999
	And you the blacker devil!	999
	999
OTHELLO	She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.	999
	999
EMILIA	Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.	999
	999
OTHELLO	She was false as water.	999
	999
EMILIA	Thou art rash as fire, to say	999
	That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.	999
	O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,	999
	But that I did proceed upon just grounds	999
	To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.	999
	999
EMILIA	My husband!	999
	999
OTHELLO	Thy husband.	999
	999
EMILIA	That she was false to wedlock?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,	999
	If heaven would make me such another world	999
	Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,	999
	I'ld not have sold her for it.	999
	999
EMILIA	My husband!	999
	999
OTHELLO	          Ay, 'twas he that told me first:	999
	An honest man he is, and hates the slime	999
	That sticks on filthy deeds.	999
	999
EMILIA	My husband!	999
	999
OTHELLO	What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.	999
	999
EMILIA	O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,	999
	My husband say that she was false!	999
	999
OTHELLO	He, woman;	999
	I say thy husband: dost understand the word?	999
	My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.	999
	999
EMILIA	If he say so, may his pernicious soul	999
	Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:	999
	She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Ha!	999
	999
EMILIA	Do thy worst:	999
	This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven	999
	Than thou wast worthy her.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Peace, you were best.	999
	999
EMILIA	Thou hast not half that power to do me harm	999
	As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!	999
	As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--	999
	I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,	999
	Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help!	999
	The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!	999
	999
	[Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others]	999
	999
MONTANO	What is the matter? How now, general!	999
	999
EMILIA	O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,	999
	That men must lay their murders on your neck.	999
	999
GRATIANO	What is the matter?	999
	999
EMILIA	Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:	999
	He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:	999
	I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:	999
	Speak, for my heart is full.	999
	999
IAGO	I told him what I thought, and told no more	999
	Than what he found himself was apt and true.	999
	999
EMILIA	But did you ever tell him she was false?	999
	999
IAGO	I did.	999
	999
EMILIA	You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;	999
	Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.	999
	She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?	999
	999
IAGO	With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.	999
	999
EMILIA	I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:	999
	My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--	999
	999
All	O heavens forfend!	999
	999
EMILIA	And your reports have set the murder on.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.	999
	999
GRATIANO	'Tis a strange truth.	999
	999
MONTANO	O monstrous act!	999
	999
EMILIA	                  Villany, villany, villany!	999
	I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!--	999
	I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--	999
	O villany, villany!	999
	999
IAGO	What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.	999
	999
EMILIA	Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:	999
	999
	'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.	999
	Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.	999
	999
OTHELLO	O! O! O!	999
	999
	[He falls on the bed]	999
	999
EMILIA	       Nay, lay thee down and roar;	999
	For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent	999
	That e'er did lift up eye.	999
	999
OTHELLO	[Rising]  O, she was foul!	999
	I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,	999
	Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:	999
	I know this act shows horrible and grim.	999
	999
GRATIANO	Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:	999
	Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief	999
	Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,	999
	This sight would make him do a desperate turn,	999
	Yea, curse his better angel from his side,	999
	And fall to reprobation.	999
	999
OTHELLO	'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows	999
	That she with Cassio hath the act of shame	999
	A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:	999
	And she did gratify his amorous works	999
	With that recognizance and pledge of love	999
	Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:	999
	It was a handkerchief, an antique token	999
	My father gave my mother.	999
	999
EMILIA	O heaven! O heavenly powers!	999
	999
IAGO	Come, hold your peace.	999
	999
EMILIA	'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!	999
	No, I will speak as liberal as the north:	999
	Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,	999
	All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.	999
	999
IAGO	Be wise, and get you home.	999
	999
EMILIA	I will not.	999
	999
	[IAGO offers to stab EMILIA]	999
	999
GRATIANO	Fie!	999
	Your sword upon a woman?	999
	999
EMILIA	O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of	999
	I found by fortune and did give my husband;	999
	For often, with a solemn earnestness,	999
	More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,	999
	He begg'd of me to steal it.	999
	999
IAGO	Villanous whore!	999
	999
EMILIA	She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,	999
	And I did give't my husband.	999
	999
IAGO	Filth, thou liest!	999
	999
EMILIA	By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.	999
	O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool	999
	Do with so good a woman?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Are there no stones in heaven	999
	But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!	999
	999
	[He runs at IAGO  IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exit]	999
	999
GRATIANO	The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.	999
	999
EMILIA	Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.	999
	999
GRATIANO	He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.	999
	999
MONTANO	'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,	999
	Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:	999
	Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,	999
	But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,	999
	For 'tis a damned slave.	999
	999
	[Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO]	999
	999
OTHELLO	I am not valiant neither,	999
	But ever puny whipster gets my sword:	999
	But why should honour outlive honesty?	999
	Let it go all.	999
	999
EMILIA	What did thy song bode, lady?	999
	Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.	999
	And die in music.	999
	999
	[Singing]	999
	999
	Willow, willow, willow,--	999
	Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;	999
	So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;	999
	So speaking as I think, I die, I die.	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
OTHELLO	I have another weapon in this chamber;	999
	It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:--	999
	O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.	999
	999
GRATIANO	[Within]  If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:	999
	Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Look in upon me then and speak with me,	999
	Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.	999
	999
	[Re-enter GRATIANO]	999
	999
GRATIANO	What is the matter?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Behold, I have a weapon;	999
	A better never did itself sustain	999
	Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,	999
	That, with this little arm and this good sword,	999
	I have made my way through more impediments	999
	Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!	999
	Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.	999
	Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;	999
	Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,	999
	And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.	999
	Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;	999
	Man but a rush against Othello's breast,	999
	And he retires. Where should Othello go?	999
	Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!	999
	Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,	999
	This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,	999
	And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!	999
	Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!	999
	Whip me, ye devils,	999
	From the possession of this heavenly sight!	999
	Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!	999
	Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!	999
	O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!	999
	Oh! Oh! Oh!	999
	999
	[Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair,	999
	and Officers with IAGO, prisoner]	999
	999
LODOVICO	Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?	999
	999
OTHELLO	That's he that was Othello: here I am.	999
	999
LODOVICO	Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.	999
	If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.	999
	999
	[Wounds IAGO]	999
	999
LODOVICO	Wrench his sword from him.	999
	999
IAGO	I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;	999
	For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.	999
	999
LODOVICO	O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,	999
	Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,	999
	What shall be said to thee?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Why, any thing:	999
	An honourable murderer, if you will;	999
	For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.	999
	999
LODOVICO	This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:	999
	Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?	999
	999
OTHELLO	Ay.	999
	999
CASSIO	Dear general, I never gave you cause.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.	999
	Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil	999
	Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?	999
	999
IAGO	Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:	999
	From this time forth I never will speak word.	999
	999
LODOVICO	What, not to pray?	999
	999
GRATIANO	                  Torments will ope your lips.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Well, thou dost best.	999
	999
LODOVICO	Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,	999
	Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter	999
	Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;	999
	And here another: the one of them imports	999
	The death of Cassio to be undertook	999
	By Roderigo.	999
	999
OTHELLO	O villain!	999
	999
CASSIO	Most heathenish and most gross!	999
	999
LODOVICO	Now here's another discontented paper,	999
	Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,	999
	Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;	999
	But that belike Iago in the interim	999
	Came in and satisfied him.	999
	999
OTHELLO	O the pernicious caitiff!	999
	How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief	999
	That was my wife's?	999
	999
CASSIO	I found it in my chamber:	999
	And he himself confess'd but even now	999
	That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose	999
	Which wrought to his desire.	999
	999
OTHELLO	O fool! fool! fool!	999
	999
CASSIO	There is besides in Roderigo's letter,	999
	How he upbraids Iago, that he made him	999
	Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came	999
	That I was cast: and even but now he spake,	999
	After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,	999
	Iago set him on.	999
	999
LODOVICO	You must forsake this room, and go with us:	999
	Your power and your command is taken off,	999
	And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,	999
	If there be any cunning cruelty	999
	That can torment him much and hold him long,	999
	It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,	999
	Till that the nature of your fault be known	999
	To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.	999
	999
OTHELLO	Soft you; a word or two before you go.	999
	I have done the state some service, and they know't.	999
	No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,	999
	When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,	999
	Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,	999
	Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak	999
	Of one that loved not wisely but too well;	999
	Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought	999
	Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,	999
	Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away	999
	Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,	999
	Albeit unused to the melting mood,	999
	Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees	999
	Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;	999
	And say besides, that in Aleppo once,	999
	Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk	999
	Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,	999
	I took by the throat the circumcised dog,	999
	And smote him, thus.	999
	999
	[Stabs himself]	999
	999
LODOVICO	O bloody period!	999
	999
GRATIANO	                  All that's spoke is marr'd.	999
	999
OTHELLO	I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;	999
	Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.	999
	999
	[Falls on the bed, and dies]	999
	999
CASSIO	This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;	999
	For he was great of heart.	999
	999
LODOVICO	[To IAGO]  O Spartan dog,	999
	More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!	999
	Look on the tragic loading of this bed;	999
	This is thy work: the object poisons sight;	999
	Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,	999
	And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,	999
	For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,	999
	Remains the censure of this hellish villain;	999
	The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!	999
	Myself will straight aboard: and to the state	999
	This heavy act with heavy heart relate.	999

	TIMON OF ATHENS	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Athens. A hall in Timon's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and	999
	others, at several doors]	999
	999
Poet	Good day, sir.	999
	999
Painter	                  I am glad you're well.	999
	999
Poet	I have not seen you long: how goes the world?	999
	999
Painter	It wears, sir, as it grows.	999
	999
Poet	Ay, that's well known:	999
	But what particular rarity? what strange,	999
	Which manifold record not matches? See,	999
	Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power	999
	Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.	999
	999
Painter	I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.	999
	999
Merchant	O, 'tis a worthy lord.	999
	999
Jeweller	Nay, that's most fix'd.	999
	999
Merchant	A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,	999
	To an untirable and continuate goodness:	999
	He passes.	999
	999
Jeweller:	I have a jewel here--	999
	999
Merchant	O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?	999
	999
Jeweller:	If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--	999
	999
Poet	[Reciting to himself]  'When we for recompense have	999
	praised the vile,	999
	It stains the glory in that happy verse	999
	Which aptly sings the good.'	999
	999
Merchant	'Tis a good form.	999
	999
	[Looking at the jewel]	999
	999
Jeweller	And rich: here is a water, look ye.	999
	999
Painter	You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication	999
	To the great lord.	999
	999
Poet	                  A thing slipp'd idly from me.	999
	Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes	999
	From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint	999
	Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame	999
	Provokes itself and like the current flies	999
	Each bound it chafes. What have you there?	999
	999
Painter	A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?	999
	999
Poet	Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.	999
	Let's see your piece.	999
	999
Painter	'Tis a good piece.	999
	999
Poet	So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.	999
	999
Painter	Indifferent.	999
	999
Poet	                  Admirable: how this grace	999
	Speaks his own standing! what a mental power	999
	This eye shoots forth! how big imagination	999
	Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture	999
	One might interpret.	999
	999
Painter	It is a pretty mocking of the life.	999
	Here is a touch; is't good?	999
	999
Poet	I will say of it,	999
	It tutors nature: artificial strife	999
	Lives in these touches, livelier than life.	999
	999
	[Enter certain Senators, and pass over]	999
	999
Painter	How this lord is follow'd!	999
	999
Poet	The senators of Athens: happy man!	999
	999
Painter	Look, more!	999
	999
Poet	You see this confluence, this great flood	999
	of visitors.	999
	I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,	999
	Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug	999
	With amplest entertainment: my free drift	999
	Halts not particularly, but moves itself	999
	In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice	999
	Infects one comma in the course I hold;	999
	But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,	999
	Leaving no tract behind.	999
	999
Painter	How shall I understand you?	999
	999
Poet	I will unbolt to you.	999
	You see how all conditions, how all minds,	999
	As well of glib and slippery creatures as	999
	Of grave and austere quality, tender down	999
	Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune	999
	Upon his good and gracious nature hanging	999
	Subdues and properties to his love and tendance	999
	All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer	999
	To Apemantus, that few things loves better	999
	Than to abhor himself: even he drops down	999
	The knee before him, and returns in peace	999
	Most rich in Timon's nod.	999
	999
Painter	I saw them speak together.	999
	999
Poet	Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill	999
	Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount	999
	Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,	999
	That labour on the bosom of this sphere	999
	To propagate their states: amongst them all,	999
	Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,	999
	One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,	999
	Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;	999
	Whose present grace to present slaves and servants	999
	Translates his rivals.	999
	999
Painter	'Tis conceived to scope.	999
	This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,	999
	With one man beckon'd from the rest below,	999
	Bowing his head against the sleepy mount	999
	To climb his happiness, would be well express'd	999
	In our condition.	999
	999
Poet	                  Nay, sir, but hear me on.	999
	All those which were his fellows but of late,	999
	Some better than his value, on the moment	999
	Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,	999
	Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,	999
	Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him	999
	Drink the free air.	999
	999
Painter	Ay, marry, what of these?	999
	999
Poet	When Fortune in her shift and change of mood	999
	Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants	999
	Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top	999
	Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,	999
	Not one accompanying his declining foot.	999
	999
Painter	'Tis common:	999
	A thousand moral paintings I can show	999
	That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's	999
	More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well	999
	To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen	999
	The foot above the head.	999
	999
	[Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself	999
	courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from	999
	VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other	999
	servants following]	999
	999
TIMON	Imprison'd is he, say you?	999
	999
Messenger	Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,	999
	His means most short, his creditors most strait:	999
	Your honourable letter he desires	999
	To those have shut him up; which failing,	999
	Periods his comfort.	999
	999
TIMON	Noble Ventidius! Well;	999
	I am not of that feather to shake off	999
	My friend when he must need me. I do know him	999
	A gentleman that well deserves a help:	999
	Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,	999
	and free him.	999
	999
Messenger	Your lordship ever binds him.	999
	999
TIMON	Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;	999
	And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.	999
	'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,	999
	But to support him after. Fare you well.	999
	999
Messenger	All happiness to your honour!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter an old Athenian]	999
	999
Old Athenian	Lord Timon, hear me speak.	999
	999
TIMON	Freely, good father.	999
	999
Old Athenian	Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.	999
	999
TIMON	I have so: what of him?	999
	999
Old Athenian	Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.	999
	999
TIMON	Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!	999
	999
LUCILIUS	Here, at your lordship's service.	999
	999
Old Athenian	This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,	999
	By night frequents my house. I am a man	999
	That from my first have been inclined to thrift;	999
	And my estate deserves an heir more raised	999
	Than one which holds a trencher.	999
	999
TIMON	Well; what further?	999
	999
Old Athenian	One only daughter have I, no kin else,	999
	On whom I may confer what I have got:	999
	The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,	999
	And I have bred her at my dearest cost	999
	In qualities of the best. This man of thine	999
	Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,	999
	Join with me to forbid him her resort;	999
	Myself have spoke in vain.	999
	999
TIMON	The man is honest.	999
	999
Old Athenian	Therefore he will be, Timon:	999
	His honesty rewards him in itself;	999
	It must not bear my daughter.	999
	999
TIMON	Does she love him?	999
	999
Old Athenian	She is young and apt:	999
	Our own precedent passions do instruct us	999
	What levity's in youth.	999
	999
TIMON	[To LUCILIUS]           Love you the maid?	999
	999
LUCILIUS	Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.	999
	999
Old Athenian	If in her marriage my consent be missing,	999
	I call the gods to witness, I will choose	999
	Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,	999
	And dispossess her all.	999
	999
TIMON	How shall she be endow'd,	999
	if she be mated with an equal husband?	999
	999
Old Athenian	Three talents on the present; in future, all.	999
	999
TIMON	This gentleman of mine hath served me long:	999
	To build his fortune I will strain a little,	999
	For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:	999
	What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,	999
	And make him weigh with her.	999
	999
Old Athenian	Most noble lord,	999
	Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.	999
	999
TIMON	My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.	999
	999
LUCILIUS	Humbly I thank your lordship: never may	999
	The state or fortune fall into my keeping,	999
	Which is not owed to you!	999
	999
	[Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian]	999
	999
Poet	Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!	999
	999
TIMON	I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:	999
	Go not away. What have you there, my friend?	999
	999
Painter	A piece of painting, which I do beseech	999
	Your lordship to accept.	999
	999
TIMON	Painting is welcome.	999
	The painting is almost the natural man;	999
	or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,	999
	He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are	999
	Even such as they give out. I like your work;	999
	And you shall find I like it: wait attendance	999
	Till you hear further from me.	999
	999
Painter	The gods preserve ye!	999
	999
TIMON	Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;	999
	We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel	999
	Hath suffer'd under praise.	999
	999
Jeweller	What, my lord! dispraise?	999
	999
TIMON	A more satiety of commendations.	999
	If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,	999
	It would unclew me quite.	999
	999
Jeweller	My lord, 'tis rated	999
	As those which sell would give: but you well know,	999
	Things of like value differing in the owners	999
	Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,	999
	You mend the jewel by the wearing it.	999
	999
TIMON	Well mock'd.	999
	999
Merchant	No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,	999
	Which all men speak with him.	999
	999
TIMON	Look, who comes here: will you be chid?	999
	999
	[Enter APEMANTUS]	999
	999
Jeweller: We'll bear, with your lordship.	999
	999
Merchant	He'll spare none.	999
	999
TIMON	Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;	999
	When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.	999
	999
TIMON	Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Are they not Athenians?	999
	999
TIMON	Yes.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Then I repent not.	999
	999
Jeweller: You know me, Apemantus?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.	999
	999
TIMON	Thou art proud, Apemantus.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.	999
	999
TIMON	Whither art going?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.	999
	999
TIMON	That's a deed thou'lt die for.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.	999
	999
TIMON	How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	The best, for the innocence.	999
	999
TIMON	Wrought he not well that painted it?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	He wrought better that made the painter; and yet	999
	he's but a filthy piece of work.	999
	999
Painter	You're a dog.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?	999
	999
TIMON	Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	No; I eat not lords.	999
	999
TIMON	An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.	999
	999
TIMON	That's a lascivious apprehension.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.	999
	999
TIMON	How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a	999
	man a doit.	999
	999
TIMON	What dost thou think 'tis worth?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!	999
	999
Poet	How now, philosopher!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Thou liest.	999
	999
Poet	Art not one?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Yes.	999
	999
Poet	Then I lie not.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Art not a poet?	999
	999
Poet	Yes.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou	999
	hast feigned him a worthy fellow.	999
	999
Poet	That's not feigned; he is so.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy	999
	labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'	999
	the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!	999
	999
TIMON	What wouldst do then, Apemantus?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.	999
	999
TIMON	What, thyself?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Ay.	999
	999
TIMON	Wherefore?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	That I had no angry wit to be a lord.	999
	Art not thou a merchant?	999
	999
Merchant	Ay, Apemantus.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!	999
	999
Merchant	If traffic do it, the gods do it.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!	999
	999
	[Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
TIMON	What trumpet's that?	999
	999
Messenger	'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,	999
	All of companionship.	999
	999
TIMON	Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.	999
	999
	[Exeunt some Attendants]	999
	999
	You must needs dine with me: go not you hence	999
	Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,	999
	Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.	999
	999
	[Enter ALCIBIADES, with the rest]	999
	999
	Most welcome, sir!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	                  So, so, there!	999
	Aches contract and starve your supple joints!	999
	That there should be small love 'mongst these	999
	sweet knaves,	999
	And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out	999
	Into baboon and monkey.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed	999
	Most hungerly on your sight.	999
	999
TIMON	Right welcome, sir!	999
	Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time	999
	In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all except APEMANTUS]	999
	999
	[Enter two Lords]	999
	999
First Lord	What time o' day is't, Apemantus?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Time to be honest.	999
	999
First Lord	That time serves still.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.	999
	999
Second Lord	Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.	999
	999
Second Lord	Fare thee well, fare thee well.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.	999
	999
Second Lord	Why, Apemantus?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to	999
	give thee none.	999
	999
First Lord	Hang thyself!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy	999
	requests to thy friend.	999
	999
Second Lord	Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
First Lord	He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,	999
	And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes	999
	The very heart of kindness.	999
	999
Second Lord	He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,	999
	Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays	999
	Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,	999
	But breeds the giver a return exceeding	999
	All use of quittance.	999
	999
First Lord	The noblest mind he carries	999
	That ever govern'd man.	999
	999
Second Lord	Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?	999
	999
First Lord	I'll keep you company.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	999
	999
	999
	TIMON OF ATHENS	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	A banqueting-room in Timon's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet	999
	served in; FLAVIUS and others attending; then enter	999
	TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators, and VENTIDIUS.	999
	Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS,	999
	discontentedly, like himself]	999
	999
VENTIDIUS	Most honour'd Timon,	999
	It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,	999
	And call him to long peace.	999
	He is gone happy, and has left me rich:	999
	Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound	999
	To your free heart, I do return those talents,	999
	Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help	999
	I derived liberty.	999
	999
TIMON	                  O, by no means,	999
	Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:	999
	I gave it freely ever; and there's none	999
	Can truly say he gives, if he receives:	999
	If our betters play at that game, we must not dare	999
	To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.	999
	999
VENTIDIUS	A noble spirit!	999
	999
TIMON	                  Nay, my lords,	999
	999
	[They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON]	999
	999
	Ceremony was but devised at first	999
	To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,	999
	Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;	999
	But where there is true friendship, there needs none.	999
	Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes	999
	Than my fortunes to me.	999
	999
	[They sit]	999
	999
First Lord	My lord, we always have confess'd it.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?	999
	999
TIMON	O, Apemantus, you are welcome.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	No;	999
	You shall not make me welcome:	999
	I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.	999
	999
TIMON	Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there	999
	Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.	999
	They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond	999
	man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by	999
	himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is	999
	he fit for't, indeed.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to	999
	observe; I give thee warning on't.	999
	999
TIMON	I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,	999
	therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;	999
	prithee, let my meat make thee silent.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should	999
	ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of	999
	men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me	999
	to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;	999
	and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.	999
	I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:	999
	Methinks they should invite them without knives;	999
	Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.	999
	There's much example for't; the fellow that sits	999
	next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the	999
	breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest	999
	man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a	999
	huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;	999
	Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:	999
	Great men should drink with harness on their throats.	999
	999
TIMON	My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.	999
	999
Second Lord	Let it flow this way, my good lord.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides	999
	well. Those healths will make thee and thy state	999
	look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to	999
	be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:	999
	This and my food are equals; there's no odds:	999
	Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.	999
	999
	Apemantus' grace.	999
	999
	Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;	999
	I pray for no man but myself:	999
	Grant I may never prove so fond,	999
	To trust man on his oath or bond;	999
	Or a harlot, for her weeping;	999
	Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:	999
	Or a keeper with my freedom;	999
	Or my friends, if I should need 'em.	999
	Amen. So fall to't:	999
	Rich men sin, and I eat root.	999
	999
	[Eats and drinks]	999
	999
	Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!	999
	999
TIMON	Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	My heart is ever at your service, my lord.	999
	999
TIMON	You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a	999
	dinner of friends.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meat	999
	like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,	999
	that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!	999
	999
First Lord	Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you	999
	would once use our hearts, whereby we might express	999
	some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves	999
	for ever perfect.	999
	999
TIMON	O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods	999
	themselves have provided that I shall have much help	999
	from you: how had you been my friends else? why	999
	have you that charitable title from thousands, did	999
	not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told	999
	more of you to myself than you can with modesty	999
	speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm	999
	you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any	999
	friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they	999
	were the most needless creatures living, should we	999
	ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble	999
	sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their	999
	sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished	999
	myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We	999
	are born to do benefits: and what better or	999
	properer can we can our own than the riches of our	999
	friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have	999
	so many, like brothers, commanding one another's	999
	fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!	999
	Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to	999
	forget their faults, I drink to you.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.	999
	999
Second Lord	Joy had the like conception in our eyes	999
	And at that instant like a babe sprung up.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.	999
	999
Third Lord	I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Much!	999
	999
	[Tucket, within]	999
	999
TIMON	What means that trump?	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
		 How now?	999
	999
Servant	Please you, my lord, there are certain	999
	ladies most desirous of admittance.	999
	999
TIMON	Ladies! what are their wills?	999
	999
Servant	There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which	999
	bears that office, to signify their pleasures.	999
	999
TIMON	I pray, let them be admitted.	999
	999
	[Enter Cupid]	999
	999
Cupid	Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all	999
	That of his bounties taste! The five best senses	999
	Acknowledge thee their patron; and come freely	999
	To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,	999
	Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise;	999
	They only now come but to feast thine eyes.	999
	999
TIMON	They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:	999
	Music, make their welcome!	999
	999
	[Exit Cupid]	999
	999
First Lord	You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.	999
	999
	[Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies	999
	as Amazons, with lutes in their hands,	999
	dancing and playing]	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!	999
	They dance! they are mad women.	999
	Like madness is the glory of this life.	999
	As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.	999
	We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;	999
	And spend our flatteries, to drink those men	999
	Upon whose age we void it up again,	999
	With poisonous spite and envy.	999
	Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?	999
	Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves	999
	Of their friends' gift?	999
	I should fear those that dance before me now	999
	Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;	999
	Men shut their doors against a setting sun.	999
	999
	[The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of	999
	TIMON; and to show their loves, each singles out an	999
	Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty	999
	strain or two to the hautboys, and cease]	999
	999
TIMON	You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,	999
	Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,	999
	Which was not half so beautiful and kind;	999
	You have added worth unto 't and lustre,	999
	And entertain'd me with mine own device;	999
	I am to thank you for 't.	999
	999
First Lady	My lord, you take us even at the best.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	'Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not hold	999
	taking, I doubt me.	999
	999
TIMON	Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:	999
	Please you to dispose yourselves.	999
	999
All Ladies	Most thankfully, my lord.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Cupid and Ladies]	999
	999
TIMON	Flavius.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	My lord?	999
	999
TIMON	       The little casket bring me hither.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!	999
	There is no crossing him in 's humour;	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,	999
	When all's spent, he 'ld be cross'd then, an he could.	999
	'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,	999
	That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
First Lord	Where be our men?	999
	999
Servant	Here, my lord, in readiness.	999
	999
Second Lord	Our horses!	999
	999
	[Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casket]	999
	999
TIMON	          O my friends,	999
	I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,	999
	I must entreat you, honour me so much	999
	As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,	999
	Kind my lord.	999
	999
First Lord	I am so far already in your gifts,--	999
	999
All	So are we all.	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
Servant	My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate	999
	Newly alighted, and come to visit you.	999
	999
TIMON	They are fairly welcome.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	I beseech your honour,	999
	Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.	999
	999
TIMON	Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee:	999
	I prithee, let's be provided to show them	999
	entertainment.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	[Aside]  I scarce know how.	999
	999
	[Enter a Second Servant]	999
	999
Second Servant	May it please your honour, Lord Lucius,	999
	Out of his free love, hath presented to you	999
	Four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.	999
	999
TIMON	I shall accept them fairly; let the presents	999
	Be worthily entertain'd.	999
	999
	[Enter a third Servant]	999
	999
		   How now! what news?	999
	999
Third Servant	Please you, my lord, that honourable	999
	gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company	999
	to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour	999
	two brace of greyhounds.	999
	999
TIMON	I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,	999
	Not without fair reward.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	[Aside]                What will this come to?	999
	He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,	999
	And all out of an empty coffer:	999
	Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,	999
	To show him what a beggar his heart is,	999
	Being of no power to make his wishes good:	999
	His promises fly so beyond his state	999
	That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes	999
	For every word: he is so kind that he now	999
	Pays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.	999
	Well, would I were gently put out of office	999
	Before I were forced out!	999
	Happier is he that has no friend to feed	999
	Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.	999
	I bleed inwardly for my lord.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
TIMON	You do yourselves	999
	Much wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:	999
	Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.	999
	999
Second Lord	With more than common thanks I will receive it.	999
	999
Third Lord	O, he's the very soul of bounty!	999
	999
TIMON	And now I remember, my lord, you gave	999
	Good words the other day of a bay courser	999
	I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.	999
	999
Second Lord	O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.	999
	999
TIMON	You may take my word, my lord; I know, no man	999
	Can justly praise but what he does affect:	999
	I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;	999
	I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.	999
	999
All Lords	O, none so welcome.	999
	999
TIMON	I take all and your several visitations	999
	So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;	999
	Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,	999
	And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,	999
	Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;	999
	It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living	999
	Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast	999
	Lie in a pitch'd field.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Ay, defiled land, my lord.	999
	999
First Lord	We are so virtuously bound--	999
	999
TIMON	And so	999
	Am I to you.	999
	999
Second Lord	So infinitely endear'd--	999
	999
TIMON	All to you. Lights, more lights!	999
	999
First Lord	The best of happiness,	999
	Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!	999
	999
TIMON	Ready for his friends.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON]	999
	999
APEMANTUS	What a coil's here!	999
	Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!	999
	I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums	999
	That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:	999
	Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,	999
	Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.	999
	999
TIMON	Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be	999
	good to thee.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	No, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,	999
	there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then	999
	thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,	999
	Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in	999
	paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and	999
	vain-glories?	999
	999
TIMON	Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am	999
	sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come	999
	with better music.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
APEMANTUS	So:	999
	Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then:	999
	I'll lock thy heaven from thee.	999
	O, that men's ears should be	999
	To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!	999
	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A Senator's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Senator, with papers in his hand]	999
	999
Senator	And late, five thousand: to Varro and to Isidore	999
	He owes nine thousand; besides my former sum,	999
	Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion	999
	Of raging waste? It cannot hold; it will not.	999
	If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,	999
	And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.	999
	If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty more	999
	Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,	999
	Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight,	999
	And able horses. No porter at his gate,	999
	But rather one that smiles and still invites	999
	All that pass by. It cannot hold: no reason	999
	Can found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!	999
	Caphis, I say!	999
	999
	[Enter CAPHIS]	999
	999
CAPHIS	Here, sir; what is your pleasure?	999
	999
Senator	Get on your cloak, and haste you to Lord Timon;	999
	Importune him for my moneys; be not ceased	999
	With slight denial, nor then silenced when--	999
	'Commend me to your master'--and the cap	999
	Plays in the right hand, thus: but tell him,	999
	My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn	999
	Out of mine own; his days and times are past	999
	And my reliances on his fracted dates	999
	Have smit my credit: I love and honour him,	999
	But must not break my back to heal his finger;	999
	Immediate are my needs, and my relief	999
	Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,	999
	But find supply immediate. Get you gone:	999
	Put on a most importunate aspect,	999
	A visage of demand; for, I do fear,	999
	When every feather sticks in his own wing,	999
	Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,	999
	Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.	999
	999
CAPHIS	I go, sir.	999
	999
Senator	'I go, sir!'--Take the bonds along with you,	999
	And have the dates in contempt.	999
	999
CAPHIS	I will, sir.	999
	999
Senator	Go.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	The same. A hall in Timon's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FLAVIUS, with many bills in his hand]	999
	999
FLAVIUS	No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,	999
	That he will neither know how to maintain it,	999
	Nor cease his flow of riot: takes no account	999
	How things go from him, nor resumes no care	999
	Of what is to continue: never mind	999
	Was to be so unwise, to be so kind.	999
	What shall be done? he will not hear, till feel:	999
	I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting.	999
	Fie, fie, fie, fie!	999
	999
	[Enter CAPHIS, and the Servants of Isidore and Varro]	999
	999
CAPHIS	Good even, Varro: what,	999
	You come for money?	999
	999
Varro's Servant	Is't not your business too?	999
	999
CAPHIS	It is: and yours too, Isidore?	999
	999
Isidore's Servant	It is so.	999
	999
CAPHIS	Would we were all discharged!	999
	999
Varro's Servant	I fear it.	999
	999
CAPHIS	Here comes the lord.	999
	999
	[Enter TIMON, ALCIBIADES, and Lords, &c]	999
	999
TIMON	So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again,	999
	My Alcibiades. With me? what is your will?	999
	999
CAPHIS	My lord, here is a note of certain dues.	999
	999
TIMON	Dues! Whence are you?	999
	999
CAPHIS	Of Athens here, my lord.	999
	999
TIMON	Go to my steward.	999
	999
CAPHIS	Please it your lordship, he hath put me off	999
	To the succession of new days this month:	999
	My master is awaked by great occasion	999
	To call upon his own, and humbly prays you	999
	That with your other noble parts you'll suit	999
	In giving him his right.	999
	999
TIMON	Mine honest friend,	999
	I prithee, but repair to me next morning.	999
	999
CAPHIS	Nay, good my lord,--	999
	999
TIMON	Contain thyself, good friend.	999
	999
Varro's Servant	One Varro's servant, my good lord,--	999
	999
Isidore's Servant	From Isidore;	999
	He humbly prays your speedy payment.	999
	999
CAPHIS	If you did know, my lord, my master's wants--	999
	999
Varro's Servant	'Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks And past.	999
	999
Isidore's Servant	         Your steward puts me off, my lord;	999
	And I am sent expressly to your lordship.	999
	999
TIMON	Give me breath.	999
	I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on;	999
	I'll wait upon you instantly.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ALCIBIADES and Lords]	999
	999
	[To FLAVIUS]	999
	999
		        Come hither: pray you,	999
	How goes the world, that I am thus encounter'd	999
	With clamourous demands of date-broke bonds,	999
	And the detention of long-since-due debts,	999
	Against my honour?	999
	999
FLAVIUS	                  Please you, gentlemen,	999
	The time is unagreeable to this business:	999
	Your importunacy cease till after dinner,	999
	That I may make his lordship understand	999
	Wherefore you are not paid.	999
	999
TIMON	Do so, my friends. See them well entertain'd.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Pray, draw near.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter APEMANTUS and Fool]	999
	999
CAPHIS	Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus:	999
	let's ha' some sport with 'em.	999
	999
Varro's Servant	Hang him, he'll abuse us.	999
	999
Isidore's Servant	A plague upon him, dog!	999
	999
Varro's Servant	How dost, fool?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Dost dialogue with thy shadow?	999
	999
Varro's Servant	I speak not to thee.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	No,'tis to thyself.	999
	999
	[To the Fool]	999
	999
	Come away.	999
	999
Isidore's Servant	There's the fool hangs on your back already.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.	999
	999
CAPHIS	Where's the fool now?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	He last asked the question. Poor rogues, and	999
	usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!	999
	999
All Servants	What are we, Apemantus?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Asses.	999
	999
All Servants	Why?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	That you ask me what you are, and do not know	999
	yourselves. Speak to 'em, fool.	999
	999
Fool	How do you, gentlemen?	999
	999
All Servants	Gramercies, good fool: how does your mistress?	999
	999
Fool	She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens	999
	as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Good! gramercy.	999
	999
	[Enter Page]	999
	999
Fool	Look you, here comes my mistress' page.	999
	999
Page	[To the Fool]  Why, how now, captain! what do you	999
	in this wise company? How dost thou, Apemantus?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer	999
	thee profitably.	999
	999
Page	Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of	999
	these letters: I know not which is which.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Canst not read?	999
	999
Page	No.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	There will little learning die then, that day thou	999
	art hanged. This is to Lord Timon; this to	999
	Alcibiades. Go; thou wast born a bastard, and thou't	999
	die a bawd.	999
	999
Page	Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish a	999
	dog's death. Answer not; I am gone.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
APEMANTUS	E'en so thou outrunnest grace. Fool, I will go with	999
	you to Lord Timon's.	999
	999
Fool	Will you leave me there?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?	999
	999
All Servants	Ay; would they served us!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	So would I,--as good a trick as ever hangman served thief.	999
	999
Fool	Are you three usurers' men?	999
	999
All Servants	Ay, fool.	999
	999
Fool	I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my	999
	mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come	999
	to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and	999
	go away merry; but they enter my mistress' house	999
	merrily, and go away sadly: the reason of this?	999
	999
Varro's Servant	I could render one.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster	999
	and a knave; which not-withstanding, thou shalt be	999
	no less esteemed.	999
	999
Varro's Servant	What is a whoremaster, fool?	999
	999
Fool	A fool in good clothes, and something like thee.	999
	'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord;	999
	sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher,	999
	with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is	999
	very often like a knight; and, generally, in all	999
	shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore	999
	to thirteen, this spirit walks in.	999
	999
Varro's Servant	Thou art not altogether a fool.	999
	999
Fool	Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as	999
	I have, so much wit thou lackest.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	That answer might have become Apemantus.	999
	999
All Servants	Aside, aside; here comes Lord Timon.	999
	999
	[Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS]	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Come with me, fool, come.	999
	999
Fool	I do not always follow lover, elder brother and	999
	woman; sometime the philosopher.	999
	999
	[Exeunt APEMANTUS and Fool]	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Pray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Servants]	999
	999
TIMON	You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time	999
	Had you not fully laid my state before me,	999
	That I might so have rated my expense,	999
	As I had leave of means?	999
	999
FLAVIUS	You would not hear me,	999
	At many leisures I proposed.	999
	999
TIMON	Go to:	999
	Perchance some single vantages you took.	999
	When my indisposition put you back:	999
	And that unaptness made your minister,	999
	Thus to excuse yourself.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	O my good lord,	999
	At many times I brought in my accounts,	999
	Laid them before you; you would throw them off,	999
	And say, you found them in mine honesty.	999
	When, for some trifling present, you have bid me	999
	Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;	999
	Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you	999
	To hold your hand more close: I did endure	999
	Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have	999
	Prompted you in the ebb of your estate	999
	And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,	999
	Though you hear now, too late--yet now's a time--	999
	The greatest of your having lacks a half	999
	To pay your present debts.	999
	999
TIMON	Let all my land be sold.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	'Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone;	999
	And what remains will hardly stop the mouth	999
	Of present dues: the future comes apace:	999
	What shall defend the interim? and at length	999
	How goes our reckoning?	999
	999
TIMON	To Lacedaemon did my land extend.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	O my good lord, the world is but a word:	999
	Were it all yours to give it in a breath,	999
	How quickly were it gone!	999
	999
TIMON	You tell me true.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,	999
	Call me before the exactest auditors	999
	And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,	999
	When all our offices have been oppress'd	999
	With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept	999
	With drunken spilth of wine, when every room	999
	Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,	999
	I have retired me to a wasteful cock,	999
	And set mine eyes at flow.	999
	999
TIMON	Prithee, no more.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!	999
	How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants	999
	This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?	999
	What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is	999
	Lord Timon's?	999
	Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!	999
	Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,	999
	The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:	999
	Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,	999
	These flies are couch'd.	999
	999
TIMON	Come, sermon me no further:	999
	No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;	999
	Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.	999
	Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,	999
	To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;	999
	If I would broach the vessels of my love,	999
	And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,	999
	Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use	999
	As I can bid thee speak.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Assurance bless your thoughts!	999
	999
TIMON	And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd,	999
	That I account them blessings; for by these	999
	Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you	999
	Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.	999
	Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!	999
	999
	[Enter FLAMINIUS, SERVILIUS, and other Servants]	999
	999
Servants	My lord? my lord?	999
	999
TIMON	I will dispatch you severally; you to Lord Lucius;	999
	to Lord Lucullus you: I hunted with his honour	999
	to-day: you, to Sempronius: commend me to their	999
	loves, and, I am proud, say, that my occasions have	999
	found time to use 'em toward a supply of money: let	999
	the request be fifty talents.	999
	999
FLAMINIUS	As you have said, my lord.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	[Aside]  Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!	999
	999
TIMON	Go you, sir, to the senators--	999
	Of whom, even to the state's best health, I have	999
	Deserved this hearing--bid 'em send o' the instant	999
	A thousand talents to me.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	I have been bold--	999
	For that I knew it the most general way--	999
	To them to use your signet and your name;	999
	But they do shake their heads, and I am here	999
	No richer in return.	999
	999
TIMON	Is't true? can't be?	999
	999
FLAVIUS	They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,	999
	That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot	999
	Do what they would; are sorry--you are honourable,--	999
	But yet they could have wish'd--they know not--	999
	Something hath been amiss--a noble nature	999
	May catch a wrench--would all were well--'tis pity;--	999
	And so, intending other serious matters,	999
	After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,	999
	With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods	999
	They froze me into silence.	999
	999
TIMON	You gods, reward them!	999
	Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows	999
	Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:	999
	Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;	999
	'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;	999
	And nature, as it grows again toward earth,	999
	Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.	999
	999
	[To a Servant]	999
	999
	Go to Ventidius.	999
	999
	[To FLAVIUS]	999
	999
	Prithee, be not sad,	999
	Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak.	999
	No blame belongs to thee.	999
	999
	[To Servant]	999
	999
		    Ventidius lately	999
	Buried his father; by whose death he's stepp'd	999
	Into a great estate: when he was poor,	999
	Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,	999
	I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me;	999
	Bid him suppose some good necessity	999
	Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd	999
	With those five talents.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant]	999
	999
	[To FLAVIUS]	999
	999
		   That had, give't these fellows	999
	To whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak, or think,	999
	That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	I would I could not think it: that thought is	999
	bounty's foe;	999
	Being free itself, it thinks all others so.	999

	TIMON OF ATHENS	999
	999
	999
ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A room in Lucullus' house.	999
	999
	999
	[FLAMINIUS waiting. Enter a Servant to him]	999
	999
Servant	I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.	999
	999
FLAMINIUS	I thank you, sir.	999
	999
	[Enter LUCULLUS]	999
	999
Servant	Here's my lord.	999
	999
LUCULLUS	[Aside]  One of Lord Timon's men? a gift, I	999
	warrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silver	999
	basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius, honest	999
	Flaminius; you are very respectively welcome, sir.	999
	Fill me some wine.	999
	999
	[Exit Servants]	999
	999
	And how does that honourable, complete, free-hearted	999
	gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord	999
	and master?	999
	999
FLAMINIUS	His health is well sir.	999
	999
LUCULLUS	I am right glad that his health is well, sir: and	999
	what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?	999
	999
FLAMINIUS	'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir; which, in my	999
	lord's behalf, I come to entreat your honour to	999
	supply; who, having great and instant occasion to	999
	use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to	999
	furnish him, nothing doubting your present	999
	assistance therein.	999
	999
LUCULLUS	La, la, la, la! 'nothing doubting,' says he? Alas,	999
	good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not	999
	keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha'	999
	dined with him, and told him on't, and come again to	999
	supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less,	999
	and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning	999
	by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty	999
	is his: I ha' told him on't, but I could ne'er get	999
	him from't.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Servant, with wine]	999
	999
Servant	Please your lordship, here is the wine.	999
	999
LUCULLUS	Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.	999
	999
FLAMINIUS	Your lordship speaks your pleasure.	999
	999
LUCULLUS	I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt	999
	spirit--give thee thy due--and one that knows what	999
	belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if	999
	the time use thee well: good parts in thee.	999
	999
	[To Servant]	999
	999
	Get you gone, sirrah.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant]	999
	999
	Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a	999
	bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou	999
	knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,	999
	that this is no time to lend money, especially upon	999
	bare friendship, without security. Here's three	999
	solidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say	999
	thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.	999
	999
FLAMINIUS	Is't possible the world should so much differ,	999
	And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,	999
	To him that worships thee!	999
	999
	[Throwing the money back]	999
	999
LUCULLUS	Ha! now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FLAMINIUS	May these add to the number that may scald thee!	999
	Let moulten coin be thy damnation,	999
	Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!	999
	Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,	999
	It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,	999
	I feel master's passion! this slave,	999
	Unto his honour, has my lord's meat in him:	999
	Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,	999
	When he is turn'd to poison?	999
	O, may diseases only work upon't!	999
	And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature	999
	Which my lord paid for, be of any power	999
	To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!	999

	TIMON OF ATHENS	999
	999
	999
ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	A public place.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LUCILIUS, with three Strangers]	999
	999
LUCILIUS	Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and	999
	an honourable gentleman.	999
	999
First Stranger	We know him for no less, though we are but strangers	999
	to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and	999
	which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's	999
	happy hours are done and past, and his estate	999
	shrinks from him.	999
	999
LUCILIUS	Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.	999
	999
Second Stranger	But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,	999
	one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow	999
	so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and	999
	showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.	999
	999
LUCILIUS	How!	999
	999
Second Stranger	I tell you, denied, my lord.	999
	999
LUCILIUS	What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,	999
	I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!	999
	there was very little honour showed in't. For my own	999
	part, I must needs confess, I have received some	999
	small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels	999
	and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;	999
	yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should	999
	ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.	999
	999
	[Enter SERVILIUS]	999
	999
SERVILIUS	See, by good hap, yonder's my lord;	999
	I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,--	999
	999
	[To LUCIUS]	999
	999
LUCILIUS	Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:	999
	commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very	999
	exquisite friend.	999
	999
SERVILIUS	May it please your honour, my lord hath sent--	999
	999
LUCILIUS	Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to	999
	that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank	999
	him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?	999
	999
SERVILIUS	Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;	999
	requesting your lordship to supply his instant use	999
	with so many talents.	999
	999
LUCILIUS	I know his lordship is but merry with me;	999
	He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.	999
	999
SERVILIUS	But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.	999
	If his occasion were not virtuous,	999
	I should not urge it half so faithfully.	999
	999
LUCILIUS	Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?	999
	999
SERVILIUS	Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.	999
	999
LUCILIUS	What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself	999
	against such a good time, when I might ha' shown	999
	myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I	999
	should purchase the day before for a little part,	999
	and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,	999
	before the gods, I am not able to do,--the more	999
	beast, I say:--I was sending to use Lord Timon	999
	myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would	999
	not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.	999
	Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I	999
	hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,	999
	because I have no power to be kind: and tell him	999
	this from me, I count it one of my greatest	999
	afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an	999
	honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you	999
	befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?	999
	999
SERVILIUS	Yes, sir, I shall.	999
	999
LUCILIUS	I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.	999
	999
	[Exit SERVILIUS]	999
	999
	True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;	999
	And he that's once denied will hardly speed.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
First Stranger	Do you observe this, Hostilius?	999
	999
Second Stranger	Ay, too well.	999
	999
First Stranger	Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the	999
	same piece	999
	Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him	999
	His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in	999
	My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,	999
	And kept his credit with his purse,	999
	Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money	999
	Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,	999
	But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;	999
	And yet--O, see the monstrousness of man	999
	When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--	999
	He does deny him, in respect of his,	999
	What charitable men afford to beggars.	999
	999
Third Stranger	Religion groans at it.	999
	999
First Stranger	For mine own part,	999
	I never tasted Timon in my life,	999
	Nor came any of his bounties over me,	999
	To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,	999
	For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue	999
	And honourable carriage,	999
	Had his necessity made use of me,	999
	I would have put my wealth into donation,	999
	And the best half should have return'd to him,	999
	So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,	999
	Men must learn now with pity to dispense;	999
	For policy sits above conscience.	999

	TIMON OF ATHENS	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	A room in Sempronius' house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SEMPRONIUS, and a Servant of TIMON's]	999
	999
SEMPRONIUS	Must he needs trouble me in 't,--hum!--'bove	999
	all others?	999
	He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;	999
	And now Ventidius is wealthy too,	999
	Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these	999
	Owe their estates unto him.	999
	999
Servant	My lord,	999
	They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for	999
	They have au denied him.	999
	999
SEMPRONIUS	How! have they denied him?	999
	Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?	999
	And does he send to me? Three? hum!	999
	It shows but little love or judgment in him:	999
	Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like	999
	physicians,	999
	Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?	999
	Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,	999
	That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,	999
	But his occasion might have woo'd me first;	999
	For, in my conscience, I was the first man	999
	That e'er received gift from him:	999
	And does he think so backwardly of me now,	999
	That I'll requite its last? No:	999
	So it may prove an argument of laughter	999
	To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.	999
	I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,	999
	Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;	999
	I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,	999
	And with their faint reply this answer join;	999
	Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
Servant	Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The	999
	devil knew not what he did when he made man	999
	politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot	999
	think but, in the end, the villainies of man will	999
	set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to	999
	appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,	999
	like those that under hot ardent zeal would set	999
	whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his	999
	politic love.	999
	This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,	999
	Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,	999
	Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards	999
	Many a bounteous year must be employ'd	999
	Now to guard sure their master.	999
	And this is all a liberal course allows;	999
	Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.	999

SCENE IV	The same. A hall in Timon's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter two Servants of Varro, and the Servant of	999
	LUCIUS, meeting TITUS, HORTENSIUS, and other	999
	Servants of TIMON's creditors, waiting his coming out]	999
	999
Varro's	999
First Servant	Well met; good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.	999
	999
TITUS	The like to you kind Varro.	999
	999
HORTENSIUS	Lucius!	999
	What, do we meet together?	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, and I think	999
	One business does command us all; for mine Is money.	999
	999
TITUS	So is theirs and ours.	999
	999
	[Enter PHILOTUS]	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	And Sir Philotus too!	999
	999
PHILOTUS	Good day at once.	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	                  Welcome, good brother.	999
	What do you think the hour?	999
	999
PHILOTUS	Labouring for nine.	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	So much?	999
	999
PHILOTUS	Is not my lord seen yet?	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	Not yet.	999
	999
PHILOTUS	I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:	999
	You must consider that a prodigal course	999
	Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.	999
	I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;	999
	That is one may reach deep enough, and yet	999
	Find little.	999
	999
PHILOTUS	I am of your fear for that.	999
	999
TITUS	I'll show you how to observe a strange event.	999
	Your lord sends now for money.	999
	999
HORTENSIUS	Most true, he does.	999
	999
TITUS	And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,	999
	For which I wait for money.	999
	999
HORTENSIUS	It is against my heart.	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	Mark, how strange it shows,	999
	Timon in this should pay more than he owes:	999
	And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,	999
	And send for money for 'em.	999
	999
HORTENSIUS	I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:	999
	I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,	999
	And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.	999
	999
Varro's	999
First Servant	Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand mine.	999
	999
Varro's	999
First Servant	'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,	999
	Your master's confidence was above mine;	999
	Else, surely, his had equall'd.	999
	999
	Enter FLAMINIUS.	999
	999
TITUS	One of Lord Timon's men.	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	Flaminius! Sir, a word: pray, is my lord ready to	999
	come forth?	999
	999
FLAMINIUS	No, indeed, he is not.	999
	999
TITUS	We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.	999
	999
FLAMINIUS	I need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak, muffled]	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?	999
	He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him.	999
	999
TITUS	Do you hear, sir?	999
	999
Varro's	999
Second Servant	By your leave, sir,--	999
	999
FLAVIUS	What do ye ask of me, my friend?	999
	999
TITUS	We wait for certain money here, sir.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Ay,	999
	If money were as certain as your waiting,	999
	'Twere sure enough.	999
	Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,	999
	When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?	999
	Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts	999
	And take down the interest into their	999
	gluttonous maws.	999
	You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;	999
	Let me pass quietly:	999
	Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end;	999
	I have no more to reckon, he to spend.	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but this answer will not serve.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you;	999
	For you serve knaves.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
Varro's	999
First Servant	How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?	999
	999
Varro's	999
Second Servant	No matter what; he's poor, and that's revenge	999
	enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no	999
	house to put his head in? such may rail against	999
	great buildings.	999
	999
	[Enter SERVILIUS]	999
	999
TITUS	O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.	999
	999
SERVILIUS	If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some	999
	other hour, I should derive much from't; for,	999
	take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to	999
	discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;	999
	he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not sick:	999
	And, if it be so far beyond his health,	999
	Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,	999
	And make a clear way to the gods.	999
	999
SERVILIUS	Good gods!	999
	999
TITUS	We cannot take this for answer, sir.	999
	999
FLAMINIUS	[Within]  Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!	999
	999
	[Enter TIMON, in a rage, FLAMINIUS following]	999
	999
TIMON	What, are my doors opposed against my passage?	999
	Have I been ever free, and must my house	999
	Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?	999
	The place which I have feasted, does it now,	999
	Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	Put in now, Titus.	999
	999
TITUS	My lord, here is my bill.	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	Here's mine.	999
	999
HORTENSIUS	And mine, my lord.	999
	999
Both	999
Varro's Servants	And ours, my lord.	999
	999
PHILOTUS	All our bills.	999
	999
TIMON	Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	Alas, my lord,-	999
	999
TIMON	Cut my heart in sums.	999
	999
TITUS	Mine, fifty talents.	999
	999
TIMON	Tell out my blood.	999
	999
Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand crowns, my lord.	999
	999
TIMON	Five thousand drops pays that.	999
	What yours?--and yours?	999

HORTENSIUS	'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps	999

TIMON	They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.	999
	Creditors? devils!	999
	999
FLAVIUS	My dear lord,--	999
	999
TIMON	What if it should be so?	999
	999
FLAVIUS	My lord,--	999
	999
TIMON	I'll have it so. My steward!	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Here, my lord.	999
	999
TIMON	So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again,	999
	Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius:	999
	All, sirrah, all:	999
	I'll once more feast the rascals.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	O my lord,	999
	You only speak from your distracted soul;	999
	There is not so much left, to furnish out	999
	A moderate table.	999
	999
TIMON	                  Be't not in thy care; go,	999
	I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tide	999
	Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.	999

ACT III	999

	999
	999
SCENE V	The same. The senate-house. The Senate sitting.	999
	999
	999
First Senator	My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault's	999
	Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die:	999
	Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.	999
	999
Second Senator	Most true; the law shall bruise him.	999
	999
	[Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants]	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!	999
	999
First Senator	Now, captain?	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	I am an humble suitor to your virtues;	999
	For pity is the virtue of the law,	999
	And none but tyrants use it cruelly.	999
	It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy	999
	Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,	999
	Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth	999
	To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.	999
	He is a man, setting his fate aside,	999
	Of comely virtues:	999
	Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--	999
	An honour in him which buys out his fault--	999
	But with a noble fury and fair spirit,	999
	Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,	999
	He did oppose his foe:	999
	And with such sober and unnoted passion	999
	He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,	999
	As if he had but proved an argument.	999
	999
First Senator	You undergo too strict a paradox,	999
	Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:	999
	Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd	999
	To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling	999
	Upon the head of valour; which indeed	999
	Is valour misbegot and came into the world	999
	When sects and factions were newly born:	999
	He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer	999
	The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs	999
	His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,	999
	carelessly,	999
	And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,	999
	To bring it into danger.	999
	If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,	999
	What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	My lord,--	999
	999
First Senator	       You cannot make gross sins look clear:	999
	To revenge is no valour, but to bear.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,	999
	If I speak like a captain.	999
	Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,	999
	And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,	999
	And let the foes quietly cut their throats,	999
	Without repugnancy? If there be	999
	Such valour in the bearing, what make we	999
	Abroad? why then, women are more valiant	999
	That stay at home, if bearing carry it,	999
	And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon	999
	Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,	999
	If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,	999
	As you are great, be pitifully good:	999
	Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?	999
	To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;	999
	But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.	999
	To be in anger is impiety;	999
	But who is man that is not angry?	999
	Weigh but the crime with this.	999
	999
Second Senator	You breathe in vain.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	In vain! his service done	999
	At Lacedaemon and Byzantium	999
	Were a sufficient briber for his life.	999
	999
First Senator	What's that?	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	I say, my lords, he has done fair service,	999
	And slain in fight many of your enemies:	999
	How full of valour did he bear himself	999
	In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!	999
	999
Second Senator	He has made too much plenty with 'em;	999
	He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often	999
	Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:	999
	If there were no foes, that were enough	999
	To overcome him: in that beastly fury	999
	He has been known to commit outrages,	999
	And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,	999
	His days are foul and his drink dangerous.	999
	999
First Senator	He dies.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Hard fate! he might have died in war.	999
	My lords, if not for any parts in him--	999
	Though his right arm might purchase his own time	999
	And be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,	999
	Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:	999
	And, for I know your reverend ages love	999
	Security, I'll pawn my victories, all	999
	My honours to you, upon his good returns.	999
	If by this crime he owes the law his life,	999
	Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore	999
	For law is strict, and war is nothing more.	999
	999
First Senator	We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,	999
	On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,	999
	He forfeits his own blood that spills another.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,	999
	I do beseech you, know me.	999
	999
Second Senator	How!	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Call me to your remembrances.	999
	999
Third Senator	What!	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	I cannot think but your age has forgot me;	999
	It could not else be, I should prove so base,	999
	To sue, and be denied such common grace:	999
	My wounds ache at you.	999
	999
First Senator	Do you dare our anger?	999
	'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;	999
	We banish thee for ever.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Banish me!	999
	Banish your dotage; banish usury,	999
	That makes the senate ugly.	999
	999
First Senator	If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,	999
	Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell	999
	our spirit,	999
	He shall be executed presently.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Senators]	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live	999
	Only in bone, that none may look on you!	999
	I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,	999
	While they have told their money and let out	999
	Their coin upon large interest, I myself	999
	Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?	999
	Is this the balsam that the usuring senate	999
	Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!	999
	It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;	999
	It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,	999
	That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up	999
	My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.	999
	'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;	999
	Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.	999

ACT III	999

	999
SCENE VI	The same. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Music. Tables set out: Servants attending.	999
	Enter divers Lords, Senators and others, at	999
	several doors]	999
	999
First Lord	The good time of day to you, sir.	999
	999
Second Lord	I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord	999
	did but try us this other day.	999
	999
First Lord	Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we	999
	encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as	999
	he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.	999
	999
Second Lord	It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.	999
	999
First Lord	I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest	999
	inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me	999
	to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, and	999
	I must needs appear.	999
	999
Second Lord	In like manner was I in debt to my importunate	999
	business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am	999
	sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my	999
	provision was out.	999
	999
First Lord	I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all	999
	things go.	999
	999
Second Lord	Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of	999
	you?	999
	999
First Lord	A thousand pieces.	999
	999
Second Lord	A thousand pieces!	999
	999
First Lord	What of you?	999
	999
Second Lord	He sent to me, sir,--Here he comes.	999
	999
	[Enter TIMON and Attendants]	999
	999
TIMON	With all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?	999
	999
First Lord	Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.	999
	999
Second Lord	The swallow follows not summer more willing than we	999
	your lordship.	999
	999
TIMON	[Aside]  Nor more willingly leaves winter; such	999
	summer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not	999
	recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the	999
	music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the	999
	trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.	999
	999
First Lord	I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship	999
	that I returned you an empty messenger.	999
	999
TIMON	O, sir, let it not trouble you.	999
	999
Second Lord	My noble lord,--	999
	999
TIMON	Ah, my good friend, what cheer?	999
	999
Second Lord	My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,	999
	that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,	999
	I was so unfortunate a beggar.	999
	999
TIMON	Think not on 't, sir.	999
	999
Second Lord	If you had sent but two hours before,--	999
	999
TIMON	Let it not cumber your better remembrance.	999
	999
	[The banquet brought in]	999
	999
	Come, bring in all together.	999
	999
Second Lord	All covered dishes!	999
	999
First Lord	Royal cheer, I warrant you.	999
	999
Third Lord	Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield	999
	it.	999
	999
First Lord	How do you? What's the news?	999
	999
Third Lord	Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?	999
	999
	999
First Lord	|	999
	|  Alcibiades banished!	999
Second Lord	|	999
	999
	999
Third Lord	'Tis so, be sure of it.	999
	999
First Lord	How! how!	999
	999
Second Lord	I pray you, upon what?	999
	999
TIMON	My worthy friends, will you draw near?	999
	999
Third Lord	I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.	999
	999
Second Lord	This is the old man still.	999
	999
Third Lord	Will 't hold? will 't hold?	999
	999
Second Lord	It does: but time will--and so--	999
	999
Third Lord	I do conceive.	999
	999
TIMON	Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to	999
	the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all	999
	places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let	999
	the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:	999
	sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.	999
	999
	You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with	999
	thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves	999
	praised: but reserve still to give, lest your	999
	deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that	999
	one need not lend to another; for, were your	999
	godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the	999
	gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man	999
	that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without	999
	a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at	999
	the table, let a dozen of them be--as they are. The	999
	rest of your fees, O gods--the senators of Athens,	999
	together with the common lag of people--what is	999
	amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for	999
	destruction. For these my present friends, as they	999
	are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to	999
	nothing are they welcome.	999
	999
	Uncover, dogs, and lap.	999
	999
	[The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of	999
	warm water]	999
	999
Some Speak	What does his lordship mean?	999
	999
Some Others	I know not.	999
	999
TIMON	May you a better feast never behold,	999
	You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water	999
	Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;	999
	Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,	999
	Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces	999
	Your reeking villany.	999
	999
	[Throwing the water in their faces]	999
	999
		Live loathed and long,	999
	Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,	999
	Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,	999
	You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,	999
	Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!	999
	Of man and beast the infinite malady	999
	Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?	999
	Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--	999
	Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.	999
	999
	[Throws the dishes at them, and drives them out]	999
	999
	What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,	999
	Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.	999
	Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated be	999
	Of Timon man and all humanity!	999
	999

	999
Second Lord	Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?	999
	999
Third Lord	Push! did you see my cap?	999
	999
Fourth Lord	I have lost my gown.	999
	999
First Lord	He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.	999
	He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has	999
	beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?	999
	999
Third Lord	Did you see my cap?	999
	999
Second Lord	Here 'tis.	999
	999
Fourth Lord	Here lies my gown.	999
	999
First Lord	Let's make no stay.	999
	999
Second Lord	Lord Timon's mad.	999

	[Enter TIMON]	999
	999
TIMON	Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,	999
	That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,	999
	And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!	999
	Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,	999
	Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,	999
	And minister in their steads! to general filths	999
	Convert o' the instant, green virginity,	999
	Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;	999
	Rather than render back, out with your knives,	999
	And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!	999
	Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,	999
	And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;	999
	Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,	999
	pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,	999
	With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,	999
	Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,	999
	Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,	999
	Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,	999
	Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,	999
	Decline to your confounding contraries,	999
	And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,	999
	Your potent and infectious fevers heap	999
	On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,	999
	Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt	999
	As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty	999
	Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,	999
	That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,	999
	And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,	999
	Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop	999
	Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,	999
	at their society, as their friendship, may	999
	merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,	999
	But nakedness, thou detestable town!	999
	Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!	999
	Timon will to the woods; where he shall find	999
	The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.	999
	The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--	999
	The Athenians both within and out that wall!	999
	And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow	999
	To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.	999

SCENE II	Athens. A room in Timon's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FLAVIUS, with two or three Servants]	999
	999
First Servant	Hear you, master steward, where's our master?	999
	Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?	999
	Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,	999
	I am as poor as you.	999
	999
First Servant	Such a house broke!	999
	So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not	999
	One friend to take his fortune by the arm,	999
	And go along with him!	999
	999
Second Servant	As we do turn our backs	999
	From our companion thrown into his grave,	999
	So his familiars to his buried fortunes	999
	Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,	999
	Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,	999
	A dedicated beggar to the air,	999
	With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,	999
	Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.	999
	999
	[Enter other Servants]	999
	999
FLAVIUS	All broken implements of a ruin'd house.	999
	999
Third Servant	Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;	999
	That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,	999
	Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark,	999
	And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,	999
	Hearing the surges threat: we must all part	999
	Into this sea of air.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Good fellows all,	999
	The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.	999
	Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,	999
	Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,	999
	As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,	999
	'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;	999
	Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:	999
	Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.	999
	999
	[Servants embrace, and part several ways]	999
	999
	O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!	999
	Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,	999
	Since riches point to misery and contempt?	999
	Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live	999
	But in a dream of friendship?	999
	To have his pomp and all what state compounds	999
	But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?	999
	Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,	999
	Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,	999
	When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!	999
	Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?	999
	For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.	999
	My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,	999
	Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes	999
	Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!	999
	He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat	999
	Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to	999
	Supply his life, or that which can command it.	999
	I'll follow and inquire him out:	999
	I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;	999
	Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.	999

	TIMON OF ATHENS	999
	999
	999
ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	Woods and cave, near the seashore.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter TIMON, from the cave]	999
	999
	O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth	999
	Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb	999
	Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,	999
	Whose procreation, residence, and birth,	999
	Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;	999
	The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,	999
	To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,	999
	But by contempt of nature.	999
	Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;	999
	The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,	999
	The beggar native honour.	999
	It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,	999
	The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,	999
	In purity of manhood stand upright,	999
	And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,	999
	So are they all; for every grise of fortune	999
	Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate	999
	Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;	999
	There's nothing level in our cursed natures,	999
	But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd	999
	All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!	999
	His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:	999
	Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!	999
	999
	[Digging]	999
	999
	Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate	999
	With thy most operant poison! What is here?	999
	Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,	999
	I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!	999
	Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,	999
	Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.	999
	Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this	999
	Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,	999
	Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:	999
	This yellow slave	999
	Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,	999
	Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves	999
	And give them title, knee and approbation	999
	With senators on the bench: this is it	999
	That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;	999
	She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores	999
	Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices	999
	To the April day again. Come, damned earth,	999
	Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds	999
	Among the route of nations, I will make thee	999
	Do thy right nature.	999
	999
	[March afar off]	999
	999
		Ha! a drum? Thou'rt quick,	999
	But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,	999
	When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.	999
	Nay, stay thou out for earnest.	999
	999
	[Keeping some gold]	999
	999
	[Enter ALCIBIADES, with drum and fife, in	999
	warlike manner; PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA]	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	What art thou there? speak.	999
	999
TIMON	A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,	999
	For showing me again the eyes of man!	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,	999
	That art thyself a man?	999
	999
TIMON	I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.	999
	For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,	999
	That I might love thee something.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	I know thee well;	999
	But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.	999
	999
TIMON	I know thee too; and more than that I know thee,	999
	I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;	999
	With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:	999
	Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;	999
	Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine	999
	Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,	999
	For all her cherubim look.	999
	999
PHRYNIA	Thy lips rot off!	999
	999
TIMON	I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns	999
	To thine own lips again.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	How came the noble Timon to this change?	999
	999
TIMON	As the moon does, by wanting light to give:	999
	But then renew I could not, like the moon;	999
	There were no suns to borrow of.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Noble Timon,	999
	What friendship may I do thee?	999
	999
TIMON	None, but to	999
	Maintain my opinion.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	What is it, Timon?	999
	999
TIMON	Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thou	999
	wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art	999
	a man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, for	999
	thou art a man!	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.	999
	999
TIMON	Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	I see them now; then was a blessed time.	999
	999
TIMON	As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.	999
	999
TIMANDRA	Is this the Athenian minion, whom the world	999
	Voiced so regardfully?	999
	999
TIMON	Art thou Timandra?	999
	999
TIMANDRA	Yes.	999
	999
TIMON	Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;	999
	Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.	999
	Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves	999
	For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth	999
	To the tub-fast and the diet.	999
	999
TIMANDRA	Hang thee, monster!	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits	999
	Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.	999
	I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,	999
	The want whereof doth daily make revolt	999
	In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,	999
	How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,	999
	Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,	999
	But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--	999
	999
TIMON	I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.	999
	999
TIMON	How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?	999
	I had rather be alone.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Why, fare thee well:	999
	Here is some gold for thee.	999
	999
TIMON	Keep it, I cannot eat it.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,--	999
	999
TIMON	Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Ay, Timon, and have cause.	999
	999
TIMON	The gods confound them all in thy conquest;	999
	And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Why me, Timon?	999
	999
TIMON	                  That, by killing of villains,	999
	Thou wast born to conquer my country.	999
	Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on;	999
	Be as a planetary plague, when Jove	999
	Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison	999
	In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:	999
	Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;	999
	He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;	999
	It is her habit only that is honest,	999
	Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek	999
	Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,	999
	That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,	999
	Are not within the leaf of pity writ,	999
	But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,	999
	Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;	999
	Think it a bastard, whom the oracle	999
	Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,	999
	And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;	999
	Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;	999
	Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,	999
	Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,	999
	Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:	999
	Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,	999
	Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou	999
	givest me,	999
	Not all thy counsel.	999
	999
TIMON	Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse	999
	upon thee!	999
	999
	999
PHRYNIA	|	999
	|  Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?	999
TIMANDRA	|	999
	999
	999
TIMON	Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,	999
	And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,	999
	Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,	999
	Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swear	999
	Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues	999
	The immortal gods that hear you,--spare your oaths,	999
	I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;	999
	And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,	999
	Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;	999
	Let your close fire predominate his smoke,	999
	And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,	999
	Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs	999
	With burthens of the dead;--some that were hang'd,	999
	No matter:--wear them, betray with them: whore still;	999
	Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,	999
	A pox of wrinkles!	999
	999
	999
PHRYNIA	|	999
	|  Well, more gold: what then?	999
TIMANDRA	|   Believe't, that we'll do any thing for gold.	999
	999
	999
TIMON	Consumptions sow	999
	In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,	999
	And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,	999
	That he may never more false title plead,	999
	Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,	999
	That scolds against the quality of flesh,	999
	And not believes himself: down with the nose,	999
	Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away	999
	Of him that, his particular to foresee,	999
	Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate	999
	ruffians bald;	999
	And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war	999
	Derive some pain from you: plague all;	999
	That your activity may defeat and quell	999
	The source of all erection. There's more gold:	999
	Do you damn others, and let this damn you,	999
	And ditches grave you all!	999
	999
	999
PHRYNIA	|	999
	|  More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.	999
TIMANDRA	|	999
	999
	999
TIMON	More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon:	999
	If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.	999
	999
TIMON	If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	I never did thee harm.	999
	999
TIMON	Yes, thou spokest well of me.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Call'st thou that harm?	999
	999
TIMON	Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take	999
	Thy beagles with thee.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	We but offend him. Strike!	999
	999
	[Drum beats. Exeunt ALCIBIADES, PHRYNIA,	999
	and TIMANDRA]	999
	999
TIMON	That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,	999
	Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,	999
	999
	[Digging]	999
	999
	Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast,	999
	Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,	999
	Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,	999
	Engenders the black toad and adder blue,	999
	The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,	999
	With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven	999
	Whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine;	999
	Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,	999
	From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!	999
	Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,	999
	Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!	999
	Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;	999
	Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face	999
	Hath to the marbled mansion all above	999
	Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--	999
	Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;	999
	Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughts	999
	And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,	999
	That from it all consideration slips!	999
	999
	[Enter APEMANTUS]	999
	999
	More man? plague, plague!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	I was directed hither: men report	999
	Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.	999
	999
TIMON	'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,	999
	Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	This is in thee a nature but infected;	999
	A poor unmanly melancholy sprung	999
	From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?	999
	This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?	999
	Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;	999
	Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot	999
	That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,	999
	By putting on the cunning of a carper.	999
	Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive	999
	By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,	999
	And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,	999
	Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,	999
	And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;	999
	Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome	999
	To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just	999
	That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,	999
	Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.	999
	999
TIMON	Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;	999
	A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st	999
	That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,	999
	Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,	999
	That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,	999
	And skip where thou point'st out? will the	999
	cold brook,	999
	Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,	999
	To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures	999
	Whose naked natures live in an the spite	999
	Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,	999
	To the conflicting elements exposed,	999
	Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;	999
	O, thou shalt find--	999
	999
TIMON	A fool of thee: depart.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	I love thee better now than e'er I did.	999
	999
TIMON	I hate thee worse.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	                  Why?	999
	999
TIMON	Thou flatter'st misery.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.	999
	999
TIMON	Why dost thou seek me out?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	To vex thee.	999
	999
TIMON	Always a villain's office or a fool's.	999
	Dost please thyself in't?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Ay.	999
	999
TIMON	What! a knave too?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on	999
	To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou	999
	Dost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again,	999
	Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery	999
	Outlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before:	999
	The one is filling still, never complete;	999
	The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,	999
	Hath a distracted and most wretched being,	999
	Worse than the worst, content.	999
	Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.	999
	999
TIMON	Not by his breath that is more miserable.	999
	Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm	999
	With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.	999
	Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded	999
	The sweet degrees that this brief world affords	999
	To such as may the passive drugs of it	999
	Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself	999
	In general riot; melted down thy youth	999
	In different beds of lust; and never learn'd	999
	The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd	999
	The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,	999
	Who had the world as my confectionary,	999
	The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men	999
	At duty, more than I could frame employment,	999
	That numberless upon me stuck as leaves	999
	Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush	999
	Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare	999
	For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,	999
	That never knew but better, is some burden:	999
	Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time	999
	Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?	999
	They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?	999
	If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,	999
	Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff	999
	To some she beggar and compounded thee	999
	Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!	999
	If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,	999
	Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Art thou proud yet?	999
	999
TIMON	Ay, that I am not thee.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	I, that I was	999
	No prodigal.	999
	999
TIMON	                  I, that I am one now:	999
	Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,	999
	I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.	999
	That the whole life of Athens were in this!	999
	Thus would I eat it.	999
	999
	[Eating a root]	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Here; I will mend thy feast.	999
	999
	[Offering him a root]	999
	999
TIMON	First mend my company, take away thyself.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.	999
	999
TIMON	'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd;	999
	if not, I would it were.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	What wouldst thou have to Athens?	999
	999
TIMON	Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,	999
	Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Here is no use for gold.	999
	999
TIMON	The best and truest;	999
	For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Where liest o' nights, Timon?	999
	999
TIMON	Under that's above me.	999
	Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eat	999
	it.	999
	999
TIMON	Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Where wouldst thou send it?	999
	999
TIMON	To sauce thy dishes.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the	999
	extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt	999
	and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much	999
	curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but art	999
	despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for	999
	thee, eat it.	999
	999
TIMON	On what I hate I feed not.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Dost hate a medlar?	999
	999
TIMON	Ay, though it look like thee.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst	999
	have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou	999
	ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?	999
	999
TIMON	Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thou	999
	ever know beloved?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Myself.	999
	999
TIMON	I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep a	999
	dog.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	What things in the world canst thou nearest compare	999
	to thy flatterers?	999
	999
TIMON	Women nearest; but men, men are the things	999
	themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,	999
	Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.	999
	999
TIMON	Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of	999
	men, and remain a beast with the beasts?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Ay, Timon.	999
	999
TIMON	A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'	999
	attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would	999
	beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would	999
	eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would	999
	suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by	999
	the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would	999
	torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a	999
	breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy	999
	greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst	999
	hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the	999
	unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and	999
	make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert	999
	thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse:	999
	wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the	999
	leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to	999
	the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on	999
	thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy	999
	defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that	999
	were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art	999
	thou already, that seest not thy loss in	999
	transformation!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou	999
	mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of	999
	Athens is become a forest of beasts.	999
	999
TIMON	How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of	999
	company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it	999
	and give way: when I know not what else to do, I'll	999
	see thee again.	999
	999
TIMON	When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be	999
	welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.	999
	999
TIMON	Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.	999
	999
TIMON	All villains that do stand by thee are pure.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.	999
	999
TIMON	If I name thee.	999
	I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	I would my tongue could rot them off!	999
	999
TIMON	Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!	999
	Choler does kill me that thou art alive;	999
	I swound to see thee.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Would thou wouldst burst!	999
	999
TIMON	Away,	999
	Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose	999
	A stone by thee.	999
	999
	[Throws a stone at him]	999
	999
APEMANTUS	                  Beast!	999
	999
TIMON	Slave!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Toad!	999
	999
TIMON	Rogue, rogue, rogue!	999
	I am sick of this false world, and will love nought	999
	But even the mere necessities upon 't.	999
	Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;	999
	Lie where the light foam the sea may beat	999
	Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,	999
	That death in me at others' lives may laugh.	999
	999
	[To the gold]	999
	999
	O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce	999
	'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler	999
	Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!	999
	Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,	999
	Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow	999
	That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,	999
	That solder'st close impossibilities,	999
	And makest them kiss! that speak'st with	999
	every tongue,	999
	To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!	999
	Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue	999
	Set them into confounding odds, that beasts	999
	May have the world in empire!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Would 'twere so!	999
	But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:	999
	Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.	999
	999
TIMON	Throng'd to!	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Ay.	999
	999
TIMON	Thy back, I prithee.	999
	999
APEMANTUS	Live, and love thy misery.	999
	999
TIMON	Long live so, and so die.	999
	999
	[Exit APEMANTUS]	999
	999
		    I am quit.	999
	Moe things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them.	999
	999
	[Enter Banditti]	999
	999
First Bandit	Where should he have this gold? It is some poor	999
	fragment, some slender sort of his remainder: the	999
	mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his	999
	friends, drove him into this melancholy.	999
	999
Second Bandit	It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.	999
	999
Third Bandit	Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not	999
	for't, he will supply us easily; if he covetously	999
	reserve it, how shall's get it?	999
	999
Second Bandit	True; for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.	999
	999
First Bandit	Is not this he?	999
	999
Banditti	Where?	999
	999
Second Bandit	'Tis his description.	999
	999
Third Bandit	He; I know him.	999
	999
Banditti	Save thee, Timon.	999
	999
TIMON	Now, thieves?	999
	999
Banditti	Soldiers, not thieves.	999
	999
TIMON	Both too; and women's sons.	999
	999
Banditti	We are not thieves, but men that much do want.	999
	999
TIMON	Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.	999
	Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;	999
	Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;	999
	The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;	999
	The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush	999
	Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?	999
	999
First Bandit	We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,	999
	As beasts and birds and fishes.	999
	999
TIMON	Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;	999
	You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con	999
	That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not	999
	In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft	999
	In limited professions. Rascal thieves,	999
	Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,	999
	Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,	999
	And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;	999
	His antidotes are poison, and he slays	999
	Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;	999
	Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,	999
	Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.	999
	The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction	999
	Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,	999
	And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:	999
	The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves	999
	The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,	999
	That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen	999
	From general excrement: each thing's a thief:	999
	The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power	999
	Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,	999
	Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:	999
	All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,	999
	Break open shops; nothing can you steal,	999
	But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this	999
	I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.	999
	999
Third Bandit	Has almost charmed me from my profession, by	999
	persuading me to it.	999
	999
First Bandit	'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises	999
	us; not to have us thrive in our mystery.	999
	999
Second Bandit	I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.	999
	999
First Bandit	Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no time	999
	so miserable but a man may be true.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Banditti]	999
	999
	[Enter FLAVIUS]	999
	999
FLAVIUS	O you gods!	999
	Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?	999
	Full of decay and failing? O monument	999
	And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!	999
	What an alteration of honour	999
	Has desperate want made!	999
	What viler thing upon the earth than friends	999
	Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!	999
	How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,	999
	When man was wish'd to love his enemies!	999
	Grant I may ever love, and rather woo	999
	Those that would mischief me than those that do!	999
	Has caught me in his eye: I will present	999
	My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,	999
	Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!	999
	999
TIMON	Away! what art thou?	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Have you forgot me, sir?	999
	999
TIMON	Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;	999
	Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	An honest poor servant of yours.	999
	999
TIMON	Then I know thee not:	999
	I never had honest man about me, I; all	999
	I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	The gods are witness,	999
	Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief	999
	For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.	999
	999
TIMON	What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I	999
	love thee,	999
	Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st	999
	Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give	999
	But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:	999
	Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!	999
	999
FLAVIUS	I beg of you to know me, good my lord,	999
	To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts	999
	To entertain me as your steward still.	999
	999
TIMON	Had I a steward	999
	So true, so just, and now so comfortable?	999
	It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.	999
	Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man	999
	Was born of woman.	999
	Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,	999
	You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim	999
	One honest man--mistake me not--but one;	999
	No more, I pray,--and he's a steward.	999
	How fain would I have hated all mankind!	999
	And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,	999
	I fell with curses.	999
	Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;	999
	For, by oppressing and betraying me,	999
	Thou mightst have sooner got another service:	999
	For many so arrive at second masters,	999
	Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--	999
	For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--	999
	Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,	999
	If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,	999
	Expecting in return twenty for one?	999
	999
FLAVIUS	No, my most worthy master; in whose breast	999
	Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:	999
	You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:	999
	Suspect still comes where an estate is least.	999
	That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,	999
	Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,	999
	Care of your food and living; and, believe it,	999
	My most honour'd lord,	999
	For any benefit that points to me,	999
	Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange	999
	For this one wish, that you had power and wealth	999
	To requite me, by making rich yourself.	999
	999
TIMON	Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,	999
	Here, take: the gods out of my misery	999
	Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;	999
	But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;	999
	Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,	999
	But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,	999
	Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs	999
	What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,	999
	Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like	999
	blasted woods,	999
	And may diseases lick up their false bloods!	999
	And so farewell and thrive.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	O, let me stay,	999
	And comfort you, my master.	999
	999
TIMON	If thou hatest curses,	999
	Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:	999
	Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.	999
	999
	[Exit FLAVIUS. TIMON retires to his cave]	999
	999
	999
	999
	999
	TIMON OF ATHENS	999
	999
	999
ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The woods. Before Timon's cave.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Poet and Painter; TIMON watching	999
	them from his cave]	999
	999
Painter	As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where	999
	he abides.	999
	999
Poet	What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold	999
	for true, that he's so full of gold?	999
	999
Painter	Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and	999
	Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor	999
	straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said	999
	he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.	999
	999
Poet	Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.	999
	999
Painter	Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens	999
	again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore	999
	'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this	999
	supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in	999
	us; and is very likely to load our purposes with	999
	what they travail for, if it be a just true report	999
	that goes of his having.	999
	999
Poet	What have you now to present unto him?	999
	999
Painter	Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will	999
	promise him an excellent piece.	999
	999
Poet	I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent	999
	that's coming toward him.	999
	999
Painter	Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the	999
	time: it opens the eyes of expectation:	999
	performance is ever the duller for his act; and,	999
	but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the	999
	deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is	999
	most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind	999
	of will or testament which argues a great sickness	999
	in his judgment that makes it.	999
	999
	[TIMON comes from his cave, behind]	999
	999
TIMON	[Aside]  Excellent workman! thou canst not paint a	999
	man so bad as is thyself.	999
	999
Poet	I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for	999
	him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire	999
	against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery	999
	of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.	999
	999
TIMON	[Aside]  Must thou needs stand for a villain in	999
	thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in	999
	other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.	999
	999
Poet	Nay, let's seek him:	999
	Then do we sin against our own estate,	999
	When we may profit meet, and come too late.	999
	999
Painter	True;	999
	When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,	999
	Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.	999
	999
TIMON	[Aside]  I'll meet you at the turn. What a	999
	god's gold,	999
	That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple	999
	Than where swine feed!	999
	'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,	999
	Settlest admired reverence in a slave:	999
	To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye	999
	Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey!	999
	Fit I meet them.	999
	999
	[Coming forward]	999
	999
Poet	Hail, worthy Timon!	999
	999
Painter	Our late noble master!	999
	999
TIMON	Have I once lived to see two honest men?	999
	999
Poet	Sir,	999
	Having often of your open bounty tasted,	999
	Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off,	999
	Whose thankless natures--O abhorred spirits!--	999
	Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:	999
	What! to you,	999
	Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence	999
	To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover	999
	The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude	999
	With any size of words.	999
	999
TIMON	Let it go naked, men may see't the better:	999
	You that are honest, by being what you are,	999
	Make them best seen and known.	999
	999
Painter	He and myself	999
	Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,	999
	And sweetly felt it.	999
	999
TIMON	Ay, you are honest men.	999
	999
Painter	We are hither come to offer you our service.	999
	999
TIMON	Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?	999
	Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.	999
	999
Both	What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.	999
	999
TIMON	Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;	999
	I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.	999
	999
Painter	So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore	999
	Came not my friend nor I.	999
	999
TIMON	Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit	999
	Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;	999
	Thou counterfeit'st most lively.	999
	999
Painter	So, so, my lord.	999
	999
TIMON	E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,	999
	Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth	999
	That thou art even natural in thine art.	999
	But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,	999
	I must needs say you have a little fault:	999
	Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I	999
	You take much pains to mend.	999
	999
Both	Beseech your honour	999
	To make it known to us.	999
	999
TIMON	You'll take it ill.	999
	999
Both	Most thankfully, my lord.	999
	999
TIMON	Will you, indeed?	999
	999
Both	Doubt it not, worthy lord.	999
	999
TIMON	There's never a one of you but trusts a knave,	999
	That mightily deceives you.	999
	999
Both	Do we, my lord?	999
	999
TIMON	Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,	999
	Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,	999
	Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured	999
	That he's a made-up villain.	999
	999
Painter	I know none such, my lord.	999
	999
Poet	Nor I.	999
	999
TIMON	Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,	999
	Rid me these villains from your companies:	999
	Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,	999
	Confound them by some course, and come to me,	999
	I'll give you gold enough.	999
	999
Both	Name them, my lord, let's know them.	999
	999
TIMON	You that way and you this, but two in company;	999
	Each man apart, all single and alone,	999
	Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.	999
	If where thou art two villains shall not be,	999
	Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside	999
	But where one villain is, then him abandon.	999
	Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:	999
	999
	[To Painter]	999
	999
	You have work'd for me; there's payment for you: hence!	999
	999
	[To Poet]	999
	999
	You are an alchemist; make gold of that.	999
	Out, rascal dogs!	999
	999
	[Beats them out, and then retires to his cave]	999
	999
	[Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators]	999
	999
FLAVIUS	It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;	999
	For he is set so only to himself	999
	That nothing but himself which looks like man	999
	Is friendly with him.	999
	999
First Senator	Bring us to his cave:	999
	It is our part and promise to the Athenians	999
	To speak with Timon.	999
	999
Second Senator	At all times alike	999
	Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs	999
	That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,	999
	Offering the fortunes of his former days,	999
	The former man may make him. Bring us to him,	999
	And chance it as it may.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Here is his cave.	999
	Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!	999
	Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,	999
	By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:	999
	Speak to them, noble Timon.	999
	999
	[TIMON comes from his cave]	999
	999
TIMON	Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and	999
	be hang'd:	999
	For each true word, a blister! and each false	999
	Be as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,	999
	Consuming it with speaking!	999
	999
First Senator	Worthy Timon,--	999
	999
TIMON	Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.	999
	999
First Senator	The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.	999
	999
TIMON	I thank them; and would send them back the plague,	999
	Could I but catch it for them.	999
	999
First Senator	O, forget	999
	What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.	999
	The senators with one consent of love	999
	Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought	999
	On special dignities, which vacant lie	999
	For thy best use and wearing.	999
	999
Second Senator	They confess	999
	Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross:	999
	Which now the public body, which doth seldom	999
	Play the recanter, feeling in itself	999
	A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal	999
	Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;	999
	And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,	999
	Together with a recompense more fruitful	999
	Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;	999
	Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth	999
	As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs	999
	And write in thee the figures of their love,	999
	Ever to read them thine.	999
	999
TIMON	You witch me in it;	999
	Surprise me to the very brink of tears:	999
	Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,	999
	And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.	999
	999
First Senator	Therefore, so please thee to return with us	999
	And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take	999
	The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,	999
	Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name	999
	Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back	999
	Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,	999
	Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up	999
	His country's peace.	999
	999
Second Senator	And shakes his threatening sword	999
	Against the walls of Athens.	999
	999
First Senator	Therefore, Timon,--	999
	999
TIMON	Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:	999
	If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,	999
	Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,	999
	That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,	999
	And take our goodly aged men by the beards,	999
	Giving our holy virgins to the stain	999
	Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,	999
	Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,	999
	In pity of our aged and our youth,	999
	I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,	999
	And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,	999
	While you have throats to answer: for myself,	999
	There's not a whittle in the unruly camp	999
	But I do prize it at my love before	999
	The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you	999
	To the protection of the prosperous gods,	999
	As thieves to keepers.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Stay not, all's in vain.	999
	999
TIMON	Why, I was writing of my epitaph;	999
	it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness	999
	Of health and living now begins to mend,	999
	And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;	999
	Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,	999
	And last so long enough!	999
	999
First Senator	We speak in vain.	999
	999
TIMON	But yet I love my country, and am not	999
	One that rejoices in the common wreck,	999
	As common bruit doth put it.	999
	999
First Senator	That's well spoke.	999
	999
TIMON	Commend me to my loving countrymen,--	999
	999
First Senator	These words become your lips as they pass	999
	thorough them.	999
	999
Second Senator	And enter in our ears like great triumphers	999
	In their applauding gates.	999
	999
TIMON	Commend me to them,	999
	And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,	999
	Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,	999
	Their pangs of love, with other incident throes	999
	That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain	999
	In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:	999
	I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.	999
	999
First Senator	I like this well; he will return again.	999
	999
TIMON	I have a tree, which grows here in my close,	999
	That mine own use invites me to cut down,	999
	And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,	999
	Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree	999
	From high to low throughout, that whoso please	999
	To stop affliction, let him take his haste,	999
	Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,	999
	And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.	999
	999
FLAVIUS	Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.	999
	999
TIMON	Come not to me again: but say to Athens,	999
	Timon hath made his everlasting mansion	999
	Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;	999
	Who once a day with his embossed froth	999
	The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,	999
	And let my grave-stone be your oracle.	999
	Lips, let sour words go by and language end:	999
	What is amiss plague and infection mend!	999
	Graves only be men's works and death their gain!	999
	Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.	999
	999
	[Retires to his cave]	999
	999
First Senator	His discontents are unremoveably	999
	Coupled to nature.	999
	999
Second Senator	Our hope in him is dead: let us return,	999
	And strain what other means is left unto us	999
	In our dear peril.	999
	999
First Senator	                  It requires swift foot.	999

First Senator	Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files	999
	As full as thy report?	999
	999
Messenger	have spoke the least:	999
	Besides, his expedition promises	999
	Present approach.	999
	999
Second Senator	We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.	999
	999
Messenger	I met a courier, one mine ancient friend;	999
	Whom, though in general part we were opposed,	999
	Yet our old love made a particular force,	999
	And made us speak like friends: this man was riding	999
	From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,	999
	With letters of entreaty, which imported	999
	His fellowship i' the cause against your city,	999
	In part for his sake moved.	999
	999
First Senator	Here come our brothers.	999
	999
	[Enter the Senators from TIMON]	999
	999
Third Senator	No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.	999
	The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring	999
	Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:	999
	Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.	999

	[Enter a Soldier, seeking TIMON]	999
	999
Soldier	By all description this should be the place.	999
	Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?	999
	Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:	999
	Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.	999
	Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb	999
	I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:	999
	Our captain hath in every figure skill,	999
	An aged interpreter, though young in days:	999
	Before proud Athens he's set down by this,	999
	Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.	999

	999
ALCIBIADES	Sound to this coward and lascivious town	999
	Our terrible approach.	999
	999
	[A parley sounded]	999
	999
	[Enter Senators on the walls]	999
	999
	Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time	999
	With all licentious measure, making your wills	999
	The scope of justice; till now myself and such	999
	As slept within the shadow of your power	999
	Have wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed	999
	Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,	999
	When crouching marrow in the bearer strong	999
	Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong	999
	Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,	999
	And pursy insolence shall break his wind	999
	With fear and horrid flight.	999
	999
First Senator	Noble and young,	999
	When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,	999
	Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,	999
	We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,	999
	To wipe out our ingratitude with loves	999
	Above their quantity.	999
	999
Second Senator	So did we woo	999
	Transformed Timon to our city's love	999
	By humble message and by promised means:	999
	We were not all unkind, nor all deserve	999
	The common stroke of war.	999
	999
First Senator	These walls of ours	999
	Were not erected by their hands from whom	999
	You have received your griefs; nor are they such	999
	That these great towers, trophies and schools	999
	should fall	999
	For private faults in them.	999
	999
Second Senator	Nor are they living	999
	Who were the motives that you first went out;	999
	Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess	999
	Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,	999
	Into our city with thy banners spread:	999
	By decimation, and a tithed death--	999
	If thy revenges hunger for that food	999
	Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth,	999
	And by the hazard of the spotted die	999
	Let die the spotted.	999
	999
First Senator	All have not offended;	999
	For those that were, it is not square to take	999
	On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,	999
	Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,	999
	Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:	999
	Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin	999
	Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall	999
	With those that have offended: like a shepherd,	999
	Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,	999
	But kill not all together.	999
	999
Second Senator	What thou wilt,	999
	Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile	999
	Than hew to't with thy sword.	999
	999
First Senator 	Set but thy foot	999
	Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;	999
	So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,	999
	To say thou'lt enter friendly.	999
	999
Second Senator	Throw thy glove,	999
	Or any token of thine honour else,	999
	That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress	999
	And not as our confusion, all thy powers	999
	Shall make their harbour in our town, till we	999
	Have seal'd thy full desire.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Then there's my glove;	999
	Descend, and open your uncharged ports:	999
	Those enemies of Timon's and mine own	999
	Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof	999
	Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears	999
	With my more noble meaning, not a man	999
	Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream	999
	Of regular justice in your city's bounds,	999
	But shall be render'd to your public laws	999
	At heaviest answer.	999
	999
Both	'Tis most nobly spoken.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	Descend, and keep your words.	999
	999
	[The Senators descend, and open the gates]	999
	999
	[Enter Soldier]	999
	999
Soldier	My noble general, Timon is dead;	999
	Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;	999
	And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which	999
	With wax I brought away, whose soft impression	999
	Interprets for my poor ignorance.	999
	999
ALCIBIADES	[Reads the epitaph]  'Here lies a	999
	wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:	999
	Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked	999
	caitiffs left!	999
	Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:	999
	Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay	999
	not here thy gait.'	999
	These well express in thee thy latter spirits:	999
	Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,	999
	Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our	999
	droplets which	999
	From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit	999
	Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye	999
	On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead	999
	Is noble Timon: of whose memory	999
	Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,	999
	And I will use the olive with my sword,	999
	Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each	999
	Prescribe to other as each other's leech.	999
	Let our drums strike.	999

	PROLOGUE	999
	999
	999
	Two households, both alike in dignity,	999
	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,	999
	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,	999
	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.	999
	From forth the fatal loins of these two foes	999
	A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;	999
	Whole misadventured piteous overthrows	999
	Do with their death bury their parents' strife.	999
	The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,	999
	And the continuance of their parents' rage,	999
	Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,	999
	Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;	999
	The which if you with patient ears attend,	999
	What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,	999
	armed with swords and bucklers]	999
	999
SAMPSON	Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.	999
	999
GREGORY	No, for then we should be colliers.	999
	999
SAMPSON	I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.	999
	999
GREGORY	Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.	999
	999
SAMPSON	I strike quickly, being moved.	999
	999
GREGORY	But thou art not quickly moved to strike.	999
	999
SAMPSON	A dog of the house of Montague moves me.	999
	999
GREGORY	To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:	999
	therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.	999
	999
SAMPSON	A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will	999
	take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.	999
	999
GREGORY	That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes	999
	to the wall.	999
	999
SAMPSON	True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,	999
	are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push	999
	Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids	999
	to the wall.	999
	999
GREGORY	The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.	999
	999
SAMPSON	'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I	999
	have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the	999
	maids, and cut off their heads.	999
	999
GREGORY	The heads of the maids?	999
	999
SAMPSON	Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;	999
	take it in what sense thou wilt.	999
	999
GREGORY	They must take it in sense that feel it.	999
	999
SAMPSON	Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and	999
	'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.	999
	999
GREGORY	'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou	999
	hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes	999
	two of the house of the Montagues.	999
	999
SAMPSON	My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.	999
	999
GREGORY	How! turn thy back and run?	999
	999
SAMPSON	Fear me not.	999
	999
GREGORY	No, marry; I fear thee!	999
	999
SAMPSON	Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.	999
	999
GREGORY	I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as	999
	they list.	999
	999
SAMPSON	Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;	999
	which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.	999
	999
	[Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR]	999
	999
ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?	999
	999
SAMPSON	I do bite my thumb, sir.	999
	999
ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?	999
	999
SAMPSON	[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I say	999
	ay?	999
	999
GREGORY	No.	999
	999
SAMPSON	No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I	999
	bite my thumb, sir.	999
	999
GREGORY	Do you quarrel, sir?	999
	999
ABRAHAM	Quarrel sir! no, sir.	999
	999
SAMPSON	If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.	999
	999
ABRAHAM	No better.	999
	999
SAMPSON	Well, sir.	999
	999
GREGORY	Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.	999
	999
SAMPSON	Yes, better, sir.	999
	999
ABRAHAM	You lie.	999
	999
SAMPSON	Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.	999
	999
	[They fight]	999
	999
	[Enter BENVOLIO]	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Part, fools!	999
	Put up your swords; you know not what you do.	999
	999
	[Beats down their swords]	999
	999
	[Enter TYBALT]	999
	999
TYBALT	What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?	999
	Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,	999
	Or manage it to part these men with me.	999
	999
TYBALT	What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,	999
	As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:	999
	Have at thee, coward!	999
	999
	[They fight]	999
	999
	[Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;	999
	then enter Citizens, with clubs]	999
	999
First Citizen	Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!	999
	Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!	999
	999
	[Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET]	999
	999
CAPULET	What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?	999
	999
CAPULET	My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,	999
	And flourishes his blade in spite of me.	999
	999
	[Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]	999
	999
MONTAGUE	Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.	999
	999
LADY MONTAGUE	Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.	999
	999
	[Enter PRINCE, with Attendants]	999
	999
PRINCE	Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,	999
	Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--	999
	Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,	999
	That quench the fire of your pernicious rage	999
	With purple fountains issuing from your veins,	999
	On pain of torture, from those bloody hands	999
	Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,	999
	And hear the sentence of your moved prince.	999
	Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,	999
	By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,	999
	Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,	999
	And made Verona's ancient citizens	999
	Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,	999
	To wield old partisans, in hands as old,	999
	Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:	999
	If ever you disturb our streets again,	999
	Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.	999
	For this time, all the rest depart away:	999
	You Capulet; shall go along with me:	999
	And, Montague, come you this afternoon,	999
	To know our further pleasure in this case,	999
	To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.	999
	Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO]	999
	999
MONTAGUE	Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?	999
	Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Here were the servants of your adversary,	999
	And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:	999
	I drew to part them: in the instant came	999
	The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,	999
	Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,	999
	He swung about his head and cut the winds,	999
	Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:	999
	While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,	999
	Came more and more and fought on part and part,	999
	Till the prince came, who parted either part.	999
	999
LADY MONTAGUE	O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?	999
	Right glad I am he was not at this fray.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun	999
	Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,	999
	A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;	999
	Where, underneath the grove of sycamore	999
	That westward rooteth from the city's side,	999
	So early walking did I see your son:	999
	Towards him I made, but he was ware of me	999
	And stole into the covert of the wood:	999
	I, measuring his affections by my own,	999
	That most are busied when they're most alone,	999
	Pursued my humour not pursuing his,	999
	And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	Many a morning hath he there been seen,	999
	With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.	999
	Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;	999
	But all so soon as the all-cheering sun	999
	Should in the furthest east begin to draw	999
	The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,	999
	Away from the light steals home my heavy son,	999
	And private in his chamber pens himself,	999
	Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out	999
	And makes himself an artificial night:	999
	Black and portentous must this humour prove,	999
	Unless good counsel may the cause remove.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?	999
	999
MONTAGUE	I neither know it nor can learn of him.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Have you importuned him by any means?	999
	999
MONTAGUE	Both by myself and many other friends:	999
	But he, his own affections' counsellor,	999
	Is to himself--I will not say how true--	999
	But to himself so secret and so close,	999
	So far from sounding and discovery,	999
	As is the bud bit with an envious worm,	999
	Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,	999
	Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.	999
	Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.	999
	We would as willingly give cure as know.	999
	999
	[Enter ROMEO]	999
	999
BENVOLIO	See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;	999
	I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,	999
	To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.	999
	999
	[Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Good-morrow, cousin.	999
	999
ROMEO	Is the day so young?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	But new struck nine.	999
	999
ROMEO	Ay me! sad hours seem long.	999
	Was that my father that went hence so fast?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?	999
	999
ROMEO	Not having that, which, having, makes them short.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	In love?	999
	999
ROMEO	Out--	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Of love?	999
	999
ROMEO	Out of her favour, where I am in love.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,	999
	Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!	999
	999
ROMEO	Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,	999
	Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!	999
	Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?	999
	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.	999
	Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.	999
	Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!	999
	O any thing, of nothing first create!	999
	O heavy lightness! serious vanity!	999
	Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!	999
	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,	999
	sick health!	999
	Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!	999
	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.	999
	Dost thou not laugh?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	No, coz, I rather weep.	999
	999
ROMEO	Good heart, at what?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	At thy good heart's oppression.	999
	999
ROMEO	Why, such is love's transgression.	999
	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,	999
	Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest	999
	With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown	999
	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.	999
	Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;	999
	Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;	999
	Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:	999
	What is it else? a madness most discreet,	999
	A choking gall and a preserving sweet.	999
	Farewell, my coz.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	                  Soft! I will go along;	999
	An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.	999
	999
ROMEO	Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;	999
	This is not Romeo, he's some other where.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.	999
	999
ROMEO	What, shall I groan and tell thee?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Groan! why, no.	999
	But sadly tell me who.	999
	999
ROMEO	Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:	999
	Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!	999
	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.	999
	999
ROMEO	A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.	999
	999
ROMEO	Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit	999
	With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;	999
	And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,	999
	From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.	999
	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,	999
	Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,	999
	Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:	999
	O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,	999
	That when she dies with beauty dies her store.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?	999
	999
ROMEO	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,	999
	For beauty starved with her severity	999
	Cuts beauty off from all posterity.	999
	She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,	999
	To merit bliss by making me despair:	999
	She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow	999
	Do I live dead that live to tell it now.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.	999
	999
ROMEO	O, teach me how I should forget to think.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	By giving liberty unto thine eyes;	999
	Examine other beauties.	999
	999
ROMEO	'Tis the way	999
	To call hers exquisite, in question more:	999
	These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows	999
	Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;	999
	He that is strucken blind cannot forget	999
	The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:	999
	Show me a mistress that is passing fair,	999
	What doth her beauty serve, but as a note	999
	Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?	999
	Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.	999

	999
SCENE II	A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant]	999
	999
CAPULET	But Montague is bound as well as I,	999
	In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,	999
	For men so old as we to keep the peace.	999
	999
PARIS	Of honourable reckoning are you both;	999
	And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.	999
	But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?	999
	999
CAPULET	But saying o'er what I have said before:	999
	My child is yet a stranger in the world;	999
	She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,	999
	Let two more summers wither in their pride,	999
	Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.	999
	999
PARIS	Younger than she are happy mothers made.	999
	999
CAPULET	And too soon marr'd are those so early made.	999
	The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,	999
	She is the hopeful lady of my earth:	999
	But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,	999
	My will to her consent is but a part;	999
	An she agree, within her scope of choice	999
	Lies my consent and fair according voice.	999
	This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,	999
	Whereto I have invited many a guest,	999
	Such as I love; and you, among the store,	999
	One more, most welcome, makes my number more.	999
	At my poor house look to behold this night	999
	Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:	999
	Such comfort as do lusty young men feel	999
	When well-apparell'd April on the heel	999
	Of limping winter treads, even such delight	999
	Among fresh female buds shall you this night	999
	Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,	999
	And like her most whose merit most shall be:	999
	Which on more view, of many mine being one	999
	May stand in number, though in reckoning none,	999
	Come, go with me.	999
	999
	[To Servant, giving a paper]	999
	999
	Go, sirrah, trudge about	999
	Through fair Verona; find those persons out	999
	Whose names are written there, and to them say,	999
	My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.	999
	999
	[Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS]	999
	999
Servant	Find them out whose names are written here! It is	999
	written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his	999
	yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with	999
	his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am	999
	sent to find those persons whose names are here	999
	writ, and can never find what names the writing	999
	person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.	999
	999
	[Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO]	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,	999
	One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;	999
	Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;	999
	One desperate grief cures with another's languish:	999
	Take thou some new infection to thy eye,	999
	And the rank poison of the old will die.	999
	999
ROMEO	Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	For what, I pray thee?	999
	999
ROMEO	For your broken shin.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Why, Romeo, art thou mad?	999
	999
ROMEO	Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;	999
	Shut up in prison, kept without my food,	999
	Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.	999
	999
Servant	God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?	999
	999
ROMEO	Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.	999
	999
Servant	Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I	999
	pray, can you read any thing you see?	999
	999
ROMEO	Ay, if I know the letters and the language.	999
	999
Servant	Ye say honestly: rest you merry!	999
	999
ROMEO	Stay, fellow; I can read.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;	999
	County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady	999
	widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely	999
	nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine	999
	uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece	999
	Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin	999
	Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair	999
	assembly: whither should they come?	999
	999
Servant	Up.	999
	999
ROMEO	Whither?	999
	999
Servant	To supper; to our house.	999
	999
ROMEO	Whose house?	999
	999
Servant	My master's.	999
	999
ROMEO	Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.	999
	999
Servant	Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the	999
	great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house	999
	of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.	999
	Rest you merry!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BENVOLIO	At this same ancient feast of Capulet's	999
	Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,	999
	With all the admired beauties of Verona:	999
	Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,	999
	Compare her face with some that I shall show,	999
	And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.	999
	999
ROMEO	When the devout religion of mine eye	999
	Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;	999
	And these, who often drown'd could never die,	999
	Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!	999
	One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun	999
	Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,	999
	Herself poised with herself in either eye:	999
	But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd	999
	Your lady's love against some other maid	999
	That I will show you shining at this feast,	999
	And she shall scant show well that now shows best.	999
	999
ROMEO	I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,	999
	But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.	999

SCENE III	A room in Capulet's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse]	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.	999
	999
Nurse	Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,	999
	I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!	999
	God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!	999
	999
	[Enter JULIET]	999
	999
JULIET	How now! who calls?	999
	999
Nurse	Your mother.	999
	999
JULIET	Madam, I am here.	999
	What is your will?	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,	999
	We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;	999
	I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.	999
	Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.	999
	999
Nurse	Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	She's not fourteen.	999
	999
Nurse	I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--	999
	And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--	999
	She is not fourteen. How long is it now	999
	To Lammas-tide?	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	                  A fortnight and odd days.	999
	999
Nurse	Even or odd, of all days in the year,	999
	Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.	999
	Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--	999
	Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;	999
	She was too good for me: but, as I said,	999
	On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;	999
	That shall she, marry; I remember it well.	999
	'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;	999
	And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--	999
	Of all the days of the year, upon that day:	999
	For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,	999
	Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;	999
	My lord and you were then at Mantua:--	999
	Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,	999
	When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple	999
	Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,	999
	To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!	999
	Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,	999
	To bid me trudge:	999
	And since that time it is eleven years;	999
	For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,	999
	She could have run and waddled all about;	999
	For even the day before, she broke her brow:	999
	And then my husband--God be with his soul!	999
	A' was a merry man--took up the child:	999
	'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?	999
	Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;	999
	Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,	999
	The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'	999
	To see, now, how a jest shall come about!	999
	I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,	999
	I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;	999
	And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.	999
	999
Nurse	Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,	999
	To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'	999
	And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow	999
	A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;	999
	A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:	999
	'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?	999
	Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;	999
	Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'	999
	999
JULIET	And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.	999
	999
Nurse	Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!	999
	Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:	999
	An I might live to see thee married once,	999
	I have my wish.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme	999
	I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,	999
	How stands your disposition to be married?	999
	999
JULIET	It is an honour that I dream not of.	999
	999
Nurse	An honour! were not I thine only nurse,	999
	I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,	999
	Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,	999
	Are made already mothers: by my count,	999
	I was your mother much upon these years	999
	That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:	999
	The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.	999
	999
Nurse	A man, young lady! lady, such a man	999
	As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Verona's summer hath not such a flower.	999
	999
Nurse	Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	What say you? can you love the gentleman?	999
	This night you shall behold him at our feast;	999
	Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,	999
	And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;	999
	Examine every married lineament,	999
	And see how one another lends content	999
	And what obscured in this fair volume lies	999
	Find written in the margent of his eyes.	999
	This precious book of love, this unbound lover,	999
	To beautify him, only lacks a cover:	999
	The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride	999
	For fair without the fair within to hide:	999
	That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,	999
	That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;	999
	So shall you share all that he doth possess,	999
	By having him, making yourself no less.	999
	999
Nurse	No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?	999
	999
JULIET	I'll look to like, if looking liking move:	999
	But no more deep will I endart mine eye	999
	Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
Servant	Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you	999
	called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in	999
	the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must	999
	hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.	999

SCENE IV	A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six	999
	Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others]	999
	999
ROMEO	What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?	999
	Or shall we on without a apology?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	The date is out of such prolixity:	999
	We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,	999
	Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,	999
	Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;	999
	Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke	999
	After the prompter, for our entrance:	999
	But let them measure us by what they will;	999
	We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.	999
	999
ROMEO	Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;	999
	Being but heavy, I will bear the light.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.	999
	999
ROMEO	Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes	999
	With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead	999
	So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,	999
	And soar with them above a common bound.	999
	999
ROMEO	I am too sore enpierced with his shaft	999
	To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,	999
	I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:	999
	Under love's heavy burden do I sink.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	And, to sink in it, should you burden love;	999
	Too great oppression for a tender thing.	999
	999
ROMEO	Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,	999
	Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	If love be rough with you, be rough with love;	999
	Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.	999
	Give me a case to put my visage in:	999
	A visor for a visor! what care I	999
	What curious eye doth quote deformities?	999
	Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,	999
	But every man betake him to his legs.	999
	999
ROMEO	A torch for me: let wantons light of heart	999
	Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,	999
	For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;	999
	I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.	999
	The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:	999
	If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire	999
	Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st	999
	Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!	999
	999
ROMEO	Nay, that's not so.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	I mean, sir, in delay	999
	We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.	999
	Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits	999
	Five times in that ere once in our five wits.	999
	999
ROMEO	And we mean well in going to this mask;	999
	But 'tis no wit to go.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Why, may one ask?	999
	999
ROMEO	I dream'd a dream to-night.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	And so did I.	999
	999
ROMEO	Well, what was yours?	999
	999
MERCUTIO	That dreamers often lie.	999
	999
ROMEO	In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.	999
	She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes	999
	In shape no bigger than an agate-stone	999
	On the fore-finger of an alderman,	999
	Drawn with a team of little atomies	999
	Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;	999
	Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,	999
	The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,	999
	The traces of the smallest spider's web,	999
	The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,	999
	Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,	999
	Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,	999
	Not so big as a round little worm	999
	Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;	999
	Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut	999
	Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,	999
	Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.	999
	And in this state she gallops night by night	999
	Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;	999
	O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,	999
	O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,	999
	O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,	999
	Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,	999
	Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:	999
	Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,	999
	And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;	999
	And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail	999
	Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,	999
	Then dreams, he of another benefice:	999
	Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,	999
	And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,	999
	Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,	999
	Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon	999
	Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,	999
	And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two	999
	And sleeps again. This is that very Mab	999
	That plats the manes of horses in the night,	999
	And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,	999
	Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:	999
	This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,	999
	That presses them and learns them first to bear,	999
	Making them women of good carriage:	999
	This is she--	999
	999
ROMEO	                  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!	999
	Thou talk'st of nothing.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	True, I talk of dreams,	999
	Which are the children of an idle brain,	999
	Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,	999
	Which is as thin of substance as the air	999
	And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes	999
	Even now the frozen bosom of the north,	999
	And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,	999
	Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;	999
	Supper is done, and we shall come too late.	999
	999
ROMEO	I fear, too early: for my mind misgives	999
	Some consequence yet hanging in the stars	999
	Shall bitterly begin his fearful date	999
	With this night's revels and expire the term	999
	Of a despised life closed in my breast	999
	By some vile forfeit of untimely death.	999
	But He, that hath the steerage of my course,	999
	Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Strike, drum.	999

ACT I	999

	999
	999
SCENE V	A hall in Capulet's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Musicians waiting. Enter Servingmen with napkins]	999
	999
First Servant	Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He	999
	shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!	999
	999
Second Servant	When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's	999
	hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.	999
	999
First Servant	Away with the joint-stools, remove the	999
	court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save	999
	me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let	999
	the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.	999
	Antony, and Potpan!	999
	999
Second Servant	Ay, boy, ready.	999
	999
First Servant	You are looked for and called for, asked for and	999
	sought for, in the great chamber.	999
	999
Second Servant	We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be	999
	brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.	999
	999
	[Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house,	999
	meeting the Guests and Maskers]	999
	999
CAPULET	Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes	999
	Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.	999
	Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all	999
	Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,	999
	She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?	999
	Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day	999
	That I have worn a visor and could tell	999
	A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,	999
	Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:	999
	You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.	999
	A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.	999
	999
	[Music plays, and they dance]	999
	999
	More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,	999
	And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.	999
	Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.	999
	Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;	999
	For you and I are past our dancing days:	999
	How long is't now since last yourself and I	999
	Were in a mask?	999
	999
Second Capulet	                  By'r lady, thirty years.	999
	999
CAPULET	What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:	999
	'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,	999
	Come pentecost as quickly as it will,	999
	Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.	999
	999
Second Capulet	'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;	999
	His son is thirty.	999
	999
CAPULET	                  Will you tell me that?	999
	His son was but a ward two years ago.	999
	999
ROMEO	[To a Servingman]  What lady is that, which doth	999
	enrich the hand	999
	Of yonder knight?	999
	999
Servant	I know not, sir.	999
	999
ROMEO	O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!	999
	It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night	999
	Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;	999
	Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!	999
	So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,	999
	As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.	999
	The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,	999
	And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.	999
	Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!	999
	For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.	999
	999
TYBALT	This, by his voice, should be a Montague.	999
	Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave	999
	Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,	999
	To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?	999
	Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,	999
	To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.	999
	999
CAPULET	Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?	999
	999
TYBALT	Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,	999
	A villain that is hither come in spite,	999
	To scorn at our solemnity this night.	999
	999
CAPULET	Young Romeo is it?	999
	999
TYBALT	'Tis he, that villain Romeo.	999
	999
CAPULET	Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;	999
	He bears him like a portly gentleman;	999
	And, to say truth, Verona brags of him	999
	To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:	999
	I would not for the wealth of all the town	999
	Here in my house do him disparagement:	999
	Therefore be patient, take no note of him:	999
	It is my will, the which if thou respect,	999
	Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,	999
	And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.	999
	999
TYBALT	It fits, when such a villain is a guest:	999
	I'll not endure him.	999
	999
CAPULET	He shall be endured:	999
	What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;	999
	Am I the master here, or you? go to.	999
	You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!	999
	You'll make a mutiny among my guests!	999
	You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!	999
	999
TYBALT	Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.	999
	999
CAPULET	Go to, go to;	999
	You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?	999
	This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:	999
	You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.	999
	Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:	999
	Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!	999
	I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!	999
	999
TYBALT	Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting	999
	Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.	999
	I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall	999
	Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ROMEO	[To JULIET]  If I profane with my unworthiest hand	999
	This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:	999
	My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand	999
	To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.	999
	999
JULIET	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,	999
	Which mannerly devotion shows in this;	999
	For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,	999
	And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.	999
	999
ROMEO	Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?	999
	999
JULIET	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.	999
	999
ROMEO	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;	999
	They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.	999
	999
JULIET	Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.	999
	999
ROMEO	Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.	999
	Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.	999
	999
JULIET	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.	999
	999
ROMEO	Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!	999
	Give me my sin again.	999
	999
JULIET	You kiss by the book.	999
	999
Nurse	Madam, your mother craves a word with you.	999
	999
ROMEO	What is her mother?	999
	999
Nurse	Marry, bachelor,	999
	Her mother is the lady of the house,	999
	And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous	999
	I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;	999
	I tell you, he that can lay hold of her	999
	Shall have the chinks.	999
	999
ROMEO	Is she a Capulet?	999
	O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Away, begone; the sport is at the best.	999
	999
ROMEO	Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.	999
	999
CAPULET	Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;	999
	We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.	999
	Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all	999
	I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.	999
	More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.	999
	Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:	999
	I'll to my rest.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse]	999
	999
JULIET	Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?	999
	999
Nurse	The son and heir of old Tiberio.	999
	999
JULIET	What's he that now is going out of door?	999
	999
Nurse	Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.	999
	999
JULIET	What's he that follows there, that would not dance?	999
	999
Nurse	I know not.	999
	999
JULIET	Go ask his name: if he be married.	999
	My grave is like to be my wedding bed.	999
	999
Nurse	His name is Romeo, and a Montague;	999
	The only son of your great enemy.	999
	999
JULIET	My only love sprung from my only hate!	999
	Too early seen unknown, and known too late!	999
	Prodigious birth of love it is to me,	999
	That I must love a loathed enemy.	999
	999
Nurse	What's this? what's this?	999
	999
JULIET	A rhyme I learn'd even now	999
	Of one I danced withal.	999
	999
	[One calls within 'Juliet.']	999
	999
Nurse	Anon, anon!	999
	Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.	999

	PROLOGUE	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Chorus]	999
	999
Chorus	Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,	999
	And young affection gapes to be his heir;	999
	That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,	999
	With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.	999
	Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,	999
	Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,	999
	But to his foe supposed he must complain,	999
	And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:	999
	Being held a foe, he may not have access	999
	To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;	999
	And she as much in love, her means much less	999
	To meet her new-beloved any where:	999
	But passion lends them power, time means, to meet	999
	Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.	999

SCENE I	A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ROMEO]	999
	999
ROMEO	Can I go forward when my heart is here?	999
	Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.	999
	999
	[He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it]	999
	999
	[Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO]	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Romeo! my cousin Romeo!	999
	999
MERCUTIO	He is wise;	999
	And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:	999
	Call, good Mercutio.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Nay, I'll conjure too.	999
	Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!	999
	Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:	999
	Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;	999
	Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'	999
	Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,	999
	One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,	999
	Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,	999
	When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!	999
	He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;	999
	The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.	999
	I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,	999
	By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,	999
	By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh	999
	And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,	999
	That in thy likeness thou appear to us!	999
	999
BENVOLIO	And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him	999
	To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle	999
	Of some strange nature, letting it there stand	999
	Till she had laid it and conjured it down;	999
	That were some spite: my invocation	999
	Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name	999
	I conjure only but to raise up him.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,	999
	To be consorted with the humorous night:	999
	Blind is his love and best befits the dark.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.	999
	Now will he sit under a medlar tree,	999
	And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit	999
	As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.	999
	Romeo, that she were, O, that she were	999
	An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!	999
	Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;	999
	This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:	999
	Come, shall we go?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	                  Go, then; for 'tis in vain	999
	To seek him here that means not to be found.	999

ROMEO	He jests at scars that never felt a wound.	999
	999
	[JULIET appears above at a window]	999
	999
	But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?	999
	It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.	999
	Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,	999
	Who is already sick and pale with grief,	999
	That thou her maid art far more fair than she:	999
	Be not her maid, since she is envious;	999
	Her vestal livery is but sick and green	999
	And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.	999
	It is my lady, O, it is my love!	999
	O, that she knew she were!	999
	She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?	999
	Her eye discourses; I will answer it.	999
	I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:	999
	Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,	999
	Having some business, do entreat her eyes	999
	To twinkle in their spheres till they return.	999
	What if her eyes were there, they in her head?	999
	The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,	999
	As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven	999
	Would through the airy region stream so bright	999
	That birds would sing and think it were not night.	999
	See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!	999
	O, that I were a glove upon that hand,	999
	That I might touch that cheek!	999
	999
JULIET	Ay me!	999
	999
ROMEO	She speaks:	999
	O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art	999
	As glorious to this night, being o'er my head	999
	As is a winged messenger of heaven	999
	Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes	999
	Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him	999
	When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds	999
	And sails upon the bosom of the air.	999
	999
JULIET	O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?	999
	Deny thy father and refuse thy name;	999
	Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,	999
	And I'll no longer be a Capulet.	999
	999
ROMEO	[Aside]  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?	999
	999
JULIET	'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;	999
	Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.	999
	What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,	999
	Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part	999
	Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!	999
	What's in a name? that which we call a rose	999
	By any other name would smell as sweet;	999
	So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,	999
	Retain that dear perfection which he owes	999
	Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,	999
	And for that name which is no part of thee	999
	Take all myself.	999
	999
ROMEO	                  I take thee at thy word:	999
	Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;	999
	Henceforth I never will be Romeo.	999
	999
JULIET	What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night	999
	So stumblest on my counsel?	999
	999
ROMEO	By a name	999
	I know not how to tell thee who I am:	999
	My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,	999
	Because it is an enemy to thee;	999
	Had I it written, I would tear the word.	999
	999
JULIET	My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words	999
	Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:	999
	Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?	999
	999
ROMEO	Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.	999
	999
JULIET	How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?	999
	The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,	999
	And the place death, considering who thou art,	999
	If any of my kinsmen find thee here.	999
	999
ROMEO	With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;	999
	For stony limits cannot hold love out,	999
	And what love can do that dares love attempt;	999
	Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.	999
	999
JULIET	If they do see thee, they will murder thee.	999
	999
ROMEO	Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye	999
	Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,	999
	And I am proof against their enmity.	999
	999
JULIET	I would not for the world they saw thee here.	999
	999
ROMEO	I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;	999
	And but thou love me, let them find me here:	999
	My life were better ended by their hate,	999
	Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.	999
	999
JULIET	By whose direction found'st thou out this place?	999
	999
ROMEO	By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;	999
	He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.	999
	I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far	999
	As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,	999
	I would adventure for such merchandise.	999
	999
JULIET	Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,	999
	Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek	999
	For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night	999
	Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny	999
	What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!	999
	Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'	999
	And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,	999
	Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries	999
	Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,	999
	If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:	999
	Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,	999
	I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,	999
	So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.	999
	In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,	999
	And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:	999
	But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true	999
	Than those that have more cunning to be strange.	999
	I should have been more strange, I must confess,	999
	But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,	999
	My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,	999
	And not impute this yielding to light love,	999
	Which the dark night hath so discovered.	999
	999
ROMEO	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear	999
	That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--	999
	999
JULIET	O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,	999
	That monthly changes in her circled orb,	999
	Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.	999
	999
ROMEO	What shall I swear by?	999
	999
JULIET	Do not swear at all;	999
	Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,	999
	Which is the god of my idolatry,	999
	And I'll believe thee.	999
	999
ROMEO	If my heart's dear love--	999
	999
JULIET	Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,	999
	I have no joy of this contract to-night:	999
	It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;	999
	Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be	999
	Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!	999
	This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,	999
	May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.	999
	Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest	999
	Come to thy heart as that within my breast!	999
	999
ROMEO	O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?	999
	999
JULIET	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?	999
	999
ROMEO	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.	999
	999
JULIET	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:	999
	And yet I would it were to give again.	999
	999
ROMEO	Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?	999
	999
JULIET	But to be frank, and give it thee again.	999
	And yet I wish but for the thing I have:	999
	My bounty is as boundless as the sea,	999
	My love as deep; the more I give to thee,	999
	The more I have, for both are infinite.	999
	999
	[Nurse calls within]	999
	999
	I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!	999
	Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.	999
	Stay but a little, I will come again.	999
	999
	[Exit, above]	999
	999
ROMEO	O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.	999
	Being in night, all this is but a dream,	999
	Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.	999
	999
	[Re-enter JULIET, above]	999
	999
JULIET	Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.	999
	If that thy bent of love be honourable,	999
	Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,	999
	By one that I'll procure to come to thee,	999
	Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;	999
	And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay	999
	And follow thee my lord throughout the world.	999
	999
Nurse	[Within]  Madam!	999
	999
JULIET	I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,	999
	I do beseech thee--	999
	999
Nurse	[Within]  Madam!	999
	999
JULIET	By and by, I come:--	999
	To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:	999
	To-morrow will I send.	999
	999
ROMEO	So thrive my soul--	999
	999
JULIET	A thousand times good night!	999
	999
	[Exit, above]	999
	999
ROMEO	A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.	999
	Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from	999
	their books,	999
	But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.	999
	999
	[Retiring]	999
	999
	[Re-enter JULIET, above]	999
	999
JULIET	Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,	999
	To lure this tassel-gentle back again!	999
	Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;	999
	Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,	999
	And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,	999
	With repetition of my Romeo's name.	999
	999
ROMEO	It is my soul that calls upon my name:	999
	How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,	999
	Like softest music to attending ears!	999
	999
JULIET	Romeo!	999
	999
ROMEO	     My dear?	999
	999
JULIET	                  At what o'clock to-morrow	999
	Shall I send to thee?	999
	999
ROMEO	At the hour of nine.	999
	999
JULIET	I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.	999
	I have forgot why I did call thee back.	999
	999
ROMEO	Let me stand here till thou remember it.	999
	999
JULIET	I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,	999
	Remembering how I love thy company.	999
	999
ROMEO	And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,	999
	Forgetting any other home but this.	999
	999
JULIET	'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:	999
	And yet no further than a wanton's bird;	999
	Who lets it hop a little from her hand,	999
	Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,	999
	And with a silk thread plucks it back again,	999
	So loving-jealous of his liberty.	999
	999
ROMEO	I would I were thy bird.	999
	999
JULIET	Sweet, so would I:	999
	Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.	999
	Good night, good night! parting is such	999
	sweet sorrow,	999
	That I shall say good night till it be morrow.	999
	999
	[Exit above]	999
	999
ROMEO	Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!	999
	Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!	999
	Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,	999
	His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	Friar Laurence's cell.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket]	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,	999
	Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,	999
	And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels	999
	From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:	999
	Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,	999
	The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,	999
	I must up-fill this osier cage of ours	999
	With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.	999
	The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;	999
	What is her burying grave that is her womb,	999
	And from her womb children of divers kind	999
	We sucking on her natural bosom find,	999
	Many for many virtues excellent,	999
	None but for some and yet all different.	999
	O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies	999
	In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:	999
	For nought so vile that on the earth doth live	999
	But to the earth some special good doth give,	999
	Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use	999
	Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:	999
	Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;	999
	And vice sometimes by action dignified.	999
	Within the infant rind of this small flower	999
	Poison hath residence and medicine power:	999
	For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;	999
	Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.	999
	Two such opposed kings encamp them still	999
	In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;	999
	And where the worser is predominant,	999
	Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.	999
	999
	[Enter ROMEO]	999
	999
ROMEO	Good morrow, father.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Benedicite!	999
	What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?	999
	Young son, it argues a distemper'd head	999
	So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:	999
	Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,	999
	And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;	999
	But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain	999
	Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:	999
	Therefore thy earliness doth me assure	999
	Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;	999
	Or if not so, then here I hit it right,	999
	Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.	999
	999
ROMEO	That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?	999
	999
ROMEO	With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;	999
	I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?	999
	999
ROMEO	I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.	999
	I have been feasting with mine enemy,	999
	Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,	999
	That's by me wounded: both our remedies	999
	Within thy help and holy physic lies:	999
	I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,	999
	My intercession likewise steads my foe.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;	999
	Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.	999
	999
ROMEO	Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set	999
	On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:	999
	As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;	999
	And all combined, save what thou must combine	999
	By holy marriage: when and where and how	999
	We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,	999
	I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,	999
	That thou consent to marry us to-day.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!	999
	Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,	999
	So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies	999
	Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.	999
	Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine	999
	Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!	999
	How much salt water thrown away in waste,	999
	To season love, that of it doth not taste!	999
	The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,	999
	Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;	999
	Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit	999
	Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:	999
	If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,	999
	Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:	999
	And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,	999
	Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.	999
	999
ROMEO	Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.	999
	999
ROMEO	And bad'st me bury love.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Not in a grave,	999
	To lay one in, another out to have.	999
	999
ROMEO	I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now	999
	Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;	999
	The other did not so.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	O, she knew well	999
	Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.	999
	But come, young waverer, come, go with me,	999
	In one respect I'll thy assistant be;	999
	For this alliance may so happy prove,	999
	To turn your households' rancour to pure love.	999
	999
ROMEO	O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.	999

	999
SCENE IV	A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO]	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Where the devil should this Romeo be?	999
	Came he not home to-night?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.	999
	Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,	999
	Hath sent a letter to his father's house.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	A challenge, on my life.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Romeo will answer it.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Any man that can write may answer a letter.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he	999
	dares, being dared.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a	999
	white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a	999
	love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the	999
	blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to	999
	encounter Tybalt?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Why, what is Tybalt?	999
	999
MERCUTIO	More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is	999
	the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as	999
	you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and	999
	proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and	999
	the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk	999
	button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the	999
	very first house, of the first and second cause:	999
	ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the	999
	hai!	999
	999
BENVOLIO	The what?	999
	999
MERCUTIO	The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting	999
	fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,	999
	a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good	999
	whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,	999
	grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with	999
	these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these	999
	perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,	999
	that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their	999
	bones, their bones!	999
	999
	[Enter ROMEO]	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,	999
	how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers	999
	that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a	999
	kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to	999
	be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;	999
	Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey	999
	eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior	999
	Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation	999
	to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit	999
	fairly last night.	999
	999
ROMEO	Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?	999
	999
MERCUTIO	The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?	999
	999
ROMEO	Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in	999
	such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	That's as much as to say, such a case as yours	999
	constrains a man to bow in the hams.	999
	999
ROMEO	Meaning, to court'sy.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Thou hast most kindly hit it.	999
	999
ROMEO	A most courteous exposition.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.	999
	999
ROMEO	Pink for flower.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Right.	999
	999
ROMEO	Why, then is my pump well flowered.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast	999
	worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it	999
	is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.	999
	999
ROMEO	O single-soled jest, solely singular for the	999
	singleness.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.	999
	999
ROMEO	Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have	999
	done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of	999
	thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:	999
	was I with you there for the goose?	999
	999
ROMEO	Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast	999
	not there for the goose.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.	999
	999
ROMEO	Nay, good goose, bite not.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most	999
	sharp sauce.	999
	999
ROMEO	And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?	999
	999
MERCUTIO	O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an	999
	inch narrow to an ell broad!	999
	999
ROMEO	I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added	999
	to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?	999
	now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art	999
	thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:	999
	for this drivelling love is like a great natural,	999
	that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Stop there, stop there.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:	999
	for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and	999
	meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.	999
	999
ROMEO	Here's goodly gear!	999
	999
	[Enter Nurse and PETER]	999
	999
MERCUTIO	A sail, a sail!	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Two, two; a shirt and a smock.	999
	999
Nurse	Peter!	999
	999
PETER	Anon!	999
	999
Nurse	My fan, Peter.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the	999
	fairer face.	999
	999
Nurse	God ye good morrow, gentlemen.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.	999
	999
Nurse	Is it good den?	999
	999
MERCUTIO	'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the	999
	dial is now upon the prick of noon.	999
	999
Nurse	Out upon you! what a man are you!	999
	999
ROMEO	One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to	999
	mar.	999
	999
Nurse	By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'	999
	quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I	999
	may find the young Romeo?	999
	999
ROMEO	I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when	999
	you have found him than he was when you sought him:	999
	I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.	999
	999
Nurse	You say well.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;	999
	wisely, wisely.	999
	999
Nurse	if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with	999
	you.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	She will indite him to some supper.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!	999
	999
ROMEO	What hast thou found?	999
	999
MERCUTIO	No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,	999
	that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	An old hare hoar,	999
	And an old hare hoar,	999
	Is very good meat in lent	999
	But a hare that is hoar	999
	Is too much for a score,	999
	When it hoars ere it be spent.	999
	Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll	999
	to dinner, thither.	999
	999
ROMEO	I will follow you.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,	999
	999
	[Singing]	999
	999
	'lady, lady, lady.'	999
	999
	[Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]	999
	999
Nurse	Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy	999
	merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?	999
	999
ROMEO	A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,	999
	and will speak more in a minute than he will stand	999
	to in a month.	999
	999
Nurse	An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him	999
	down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such	999
	Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.	999
	Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am	999
	none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by	999
	too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?	999
	999
PETER	I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon	999
	should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare	999
	draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a	999
	good quarrel, and the law on my side.	999
	999
Nurse	Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about	999
	me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:	999
	and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you	999
	out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:	999
	but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into	999
	a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross	999
	kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman	999
	is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double	999
	with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered	999
	to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.	999
	999
ROMEO	Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I	999
	protest unto thee--	999
	999
Nurse	Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:	999
	Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.	999
	999
ROMEO	What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.	999
	999
Nurse	I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as	999
	I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.	999
	999
ROMEO	Bid her devise	999
	Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;	999
	And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell	999
	Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.	999
	999
Nurse	No truly sir; not a penny.	999
	999
ROMEO	Go to; I say you shall.	999
	999
Nurse	This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.	999
	999
ROMEO	And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:	999
	Within this hour my man shall be with thee	999
	And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;	999
	Which to the high top-gallant of my joy	999
	Must be my convoy in the secret night.	999
	Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:	999
	Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.	999
	999
Nurse	Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.	999
	999
ROMEO	What say'st thou, my dear nurse?	999
	999
Nurse	Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,	999
	Two may keep counsel, putting one away?	999
	999
ROMEO	I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.	999
	999
NURSE	Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,	999
	Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there	999
	is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain	999
	lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief	999
	see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her	999
	sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer	999
	man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks	999
	as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not	999
	rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?	999
	999
ROMEO	Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.	999
	999
Nurse	Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for	999
	the--No; I know it begins with some other	999
	letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of	999
	it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good	999
	to hear it.	999
	999
ROMEO	Commend me to thy lady.	999
	999
Nurse	Ay, a thousand times.	999
	999
	[Exit Romeo]	999
	Peter!	999
	999
PETER	Anon!	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE V	Capulet's orchard.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter JULIET]	999
	999
JULIET	The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;	999
	In half an hour she promised to return.	999
	Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.	999
	O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,	999
	Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,	999
	Driving back shadows over louring hills:	999
	Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,	999
	And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.	999
	Now is the sun upon the highmost hill	999
	Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve	999
	Is three long hours, yet she is not come.	999
	Had she affections and warm youthful blood,	999
	She would be as swift in motion as a ball;	999
	My words would bandy her to my sweet love,	999
	And his to me:	999
	But old folks, many feign as they were dead;	999
	Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.	999
	O God, she comes!	999
	999
	[Enter Nurse and PETER]	999
	999
	O honey nurse, what news?	999
	Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.	999
	999
Nurse	Peter, stay at the gate.	999
	999
	[Exit PETER]	999
	999
JULIET	Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?	999
	Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;	999
	If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news	999
	By playing it to me with so sour a face.	999
	999
Nurse	I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:	999
	Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!	999
	999
JULIET	I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:	999
	Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.	999
	999
Nurse	Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?	999
	Do you not see that I am out of breath?	999
	999
JULIET	How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath	999
	To say to me that thou art out of breath?	999
	The excuse that thou dost make in this delay	999
	Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.	999
	Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;	999
	Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:	999
	Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?	999
	999
Nurse	Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not	999
	how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his	999
	face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels	999
	all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,	999
	though they be not to be talked on, yet they are	999
	past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,	999
	but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy	999
	ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?	999
	999
JULIET	No, no: but all this did I know before.	999
	What says he of our marriage? what of that?	999
	999
Nurse	Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!	999
	It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.	999
	My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!	999
	Beshrew your heart for sending me about,	999
	To catch my death with jaunting up and down!	999
	999
JULIET	I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.	999
	Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?	999
	999
Nurse	Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a	999
	courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I	999
	warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?	999
	999
JULIET	Where is my mother! why, she is within;	999
	Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!	999
	'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,	999
	Where is your mother?'	999
	999
Nurse	O God's lady dear!	999
	Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;	999
	Is this the poultice for my aching bones?	999
	Henceforward do your messages yourself.	999
	999
JULIET	Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?	999
	999
Nurse	Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?	999
	999
JULIET	I have.	999
	999
Nurse	Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;	999
	There stays a husband to make you a wife:	999
	Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,	999
	They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.	999
	Hie you to church; I must another way,	999
	To fetch a ladder, by the which your love	999
	Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:	999
	I am the drudge and toil in your delight,	999
	But you shall bear the burden soon at night.	999
	Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.	999
	999
JULIET	Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.	999

SCENE VI	Friar Laurence's cell.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO]	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	So smile the heavens upon this holy act,	999
	That after hours with sorrow chide us not!	999
	999
ROMEO	Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,	999
	It cannot countervail the exchange of joy	999
	That one short minute gives me in her sight:	999
	Do thou but close our hands with holy words,	999
	Then love-devouring death do what he dare;	999
	It is enough I may but call her mine.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	These violent delights have violent ends	999
	And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,	999
	Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey	999
	Is loathsome in his own deliciousness	999
	And in the taste confounds the appetite:	999
	Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;	999
	Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.	999
	999
	[Enter JULIET]	999
	999
	Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot	999
	Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:	999
	A lover may bestride the gossamer	999
	That idles in the wanton summer air,	999
	And yet not fall; so light is vanity.	999
	999
JULIET	Good even to my ghostly confessor.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.	999
	999
JULIET	As much to him, else is his thanks too much.	999
	999
ROMEO	Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy	999
	Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more	999
	To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath	999
	This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue	999
	Unfold the imagined happiness that both	999
	Receive in either by this dear encounter.	999
	999
JULIET	Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,	999
	Brags of his substance, not of ornament:	999
	They are but beggars that can count their worth;	999
	But my true love is grown to such excess	999
	I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, come with me, and we will make short work;	999
	For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone	999
	Till holy church incorporate two in one.	999

SCENE I	A public place.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants]	999
	999
BENVOLIO	I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:	999
	The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,	999
	And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;	999
	For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Thou art like one of those fellows that when he	999
	enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword	999
	upon the table and says 'God send me no need of	999
	thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws	999
	it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Am I like such a fellow?	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as	999
	any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as	999
	soon moody to be moved.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	And what to?	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Nay, an there were two such, we should have none	999
	shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,	999
	thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,	999
	or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou	999
	wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no	999
	other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what	999
	eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?	999
	Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of	999
	meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as	999
	an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a	999
	man for coughing in the street, because he hath	999
	wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:	999
	didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing	999
	his new doublet before Easter? with another, for	999
	tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou	999
	wilt tutor me from quarrelling!	999
	999
BENVOLIO	An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man	999
	should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	The fee-simple! O simple!	999
	999
BENVOLIO	By my head, here come the Capulets.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	By my heel, I care not.	999
	999
	[Enter TYBALT and others]	999
	999
TYBALT	Follow me close, for I will speak to them.	999
	Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	And but one word with one of us? couple it with	999
	something; make it a word and a blow.	999
	999
TYBALT	You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you	999
	will give me occasion.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Could you not take some occasion without giving?	999
	999
TYBALT	Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an	999
	thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but	999
	discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall	999
	make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!	999
	999
BENVOLIO	We talk here in the public haunt of men:	999
	Either withdraw unto some private place,	999
	And reason coldly of your grievances,	999
	Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;	999
	I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.	999
	999
	[Enter ROMEO]	999
	999
TYBALT	Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:	999
	Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;	999
	Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'	999
	999
TYBALT	Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford	999
	No better term than this,--thou art a villain.	999
	999
ROMEO	Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee	999
	Doth much excuse the appertaining rage	999
	To such a greeting: villain am I none;	999
	Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.	999
	999
TYBALT	Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries	999
	That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.	999
	999
ROMEO	I do protest, I never injured thee,	999
	But love thee better than thou canst devise,	999
	Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:	999
	And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender	999
	As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!	999
	Alla stoccata carries it away.	999
	999
	[Draws]	999
	999
	Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?	999
	999
TYBALT	What wouldst thou have with me?	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine	999
	lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you	999
	shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the	999
	eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher	999
	by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your	999
	ears ere it be out.	999
	999
TYBALT	I am for you.	999
	999
	[Drawing]	999
	999
ROMEO	Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Come, sir, your passado.	999
	999
	[They fight]	999
	999
ROMEO	Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.	999
	Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!	999
	Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath	999
	Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:	999
	Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!	999
	999
	[TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies	999
	with his followers]	999
	999
MERCUTIO	I am hurt.	999
	A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.	999
	Is he gone, and hath nothing?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	What, art thou hurt?	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.	999
	Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.	999
	999
	[Exit Page]	999
	999
ROMEO	Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a	999
	church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for	999
	me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I	999
	am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'	999
	both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a	999
	cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a	999
	rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of	999
	arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I	999
	was hurt under your arm.	999
	999
ROMEO	I thought all for the best.	999
	999
MERCUTIO	Help me into some house, Benvolio,	999
	Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!	999
	They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,	999
	And soundly too: your houses!	999
	999
	[Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]	999
	999
ROMEO	This gentleman, the prince's near ally,	999
	My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt	999
	In my behalf; my reputation stain'd	999
	With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour	999
	Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,	999
	Thy beauty hath made me effeminate	999
	And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!	999
	999
	[Re-enter BENVOLIO]	999
	999
BENVOLIO	O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!	999
	That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,	999
	Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.	999
	999
ROMEO	This day's black fate on more days doth depend;	999
	This but begins the woe, others must end.	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.	999
	999
ROMEO	Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!	999
	Away to heaven, respective lenity,	999
	And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!	999
	999
	[Re-enter TYBALT]	999
	999
	Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,	999
	That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul	999
	Is but a little way above our heads,	999
	Staying for thine to keep him company:	999
	Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.	999
	999
TYBALT	Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,	999
	Shalt with him hence.	999
	999
ROMEO	This shall determine that.	999
	999
	[They fight; TYBALT falls]	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Romeo, away, be gone!	999
	The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.	999
	Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,	999
	If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!	999
	999
ROMEO	O, I am fortune's fool!	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Why dost thou stay?	999
	999
	[Exit ROMEO]	999
	999
	[Enter Citizens, &c]	999
	999
First Citizen	Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?	999
	Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	There lies that Tybalt.	999
	999
First Citizen	Up, sir, go with me;	999
	I charge thee in the princes name, obey.	999
	999
	[Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their	999
	Wives, and others]	999
	999
PRINCE	Where are the vile beginners of this fray?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	O noble prince, I can discover all	999
	The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:	999
	There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,	999
	That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!	999
	O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt	999
	O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,	999
	For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.	999
	O cousin, cousin!	999
	999
PRINCE	Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?	999
	999
BENVOLIO	Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;	999
	Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink	999
	How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal	999
	Your high displeasure: all this uttered	999
	With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,	999
	Could not take truce with the unruly spleen	999
	Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts	999
	With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,	999
	Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,	999
	And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats	999
	Cold death aside, and with the other sends	999
	It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,	999
	Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,	999
	'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than	999
	his tongue,	999
	His agile arm beats down their fatal points,	999
	And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm	999
	An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life	999
	Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;	999
	But by and by comes back to Romeo,	999
	Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,	999
	And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I	999
	Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.	999
	And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.	999
	This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	He is a kinsman to the Montague;	999
	Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:	999
	Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,	999
	And all those twenty could but kill one life.	999
	I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;	999
	Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.	999
	999
PRINCE	Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;	999
	Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?	999
	999
MONTAGUE	Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;	999
	His fault concludes but what the law should end,	999
	The life of Tybalt.	999
	999
PRINCE	And for that offence	999
	Immediately we do exile him hence:	999
	I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,	999
	My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;	999
	But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine	999
	That you shall all repent the loss of mine:	999
	I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;	999
	Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:	999
	Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,	999
	Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.	999
	Bear hence this body and attend our will:	999
	Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Capulet's orchard.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter JULIET]	999
	999
JULIET	Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,	999
	Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner	999
	As Phaethon would whip you to the west,	999
	And bring in cloudy night immediately.	999
	Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,	999
	That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo	999
	Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.	999
	Lovers can see to do their amorous rites	999
	By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,	999
	It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,	999
	Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,	999
	And learn me how to lose a winning match,	999
	Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:	999
	Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,	999
	With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,	999
	Think true love acted simple modesty.	999
	Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;	999
	For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night	999
	Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.	999
	Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,	999
	Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,	999
	Take him and cut him out in little stars,	999
	And he will make the face of heaven so fine	999
	That all the world will be in love with night	999
	And pay no worship to the garish sun.	999
	O, I have bought the mansion of a love,	999
	But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,	999
	Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day	999
	As is the night before some festival	999
	To an impatient child that hath new robes	999
	And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,	999
	And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks	999
	But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.	999
	999
	[Enter Nurse, with cords]	999
	999
	Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords	999
	That Romeo bid thee fetch?	999
	999
Nurse	Ay, ay, the cords.	999
	999
	[Throws them down]	999
	999
JULIET	Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?	999
	999
Nurse	Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!	999
	We are undone, lady, we are undone!	999
	Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!	999
	999
JULIET	Can heaven be so envious?	999
	999
Nurse	Romeo can,	999
	Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!	999
	Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!	999
	999
JULIET	What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?	999
	This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.	999
	Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'	999
	And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more	999
	Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:	999
	I am not I, if there be such an I;	999
	Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'	999
	If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:	999
	Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.	999
	999
Nurse	I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--	999
	God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:	999
	A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;	999
	Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,	999
	All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.	999
	999
JULIET	O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!	999
	To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!	999
	Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;	999
	And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!	999
	999
Nurse	O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!	999
	O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!	999
	That ever I should live to see thee dead!	999
	999
JULIET	What storm is this that blows so contrary?	999
	Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?	999
	My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?	999
	Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!	999
	For who is living, if those two are gone?	999
	999
Nurse	Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;	999
	Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.	999
	999
JULIET	O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?	999
	999
Nurse	It did, it did; alas the day, it did!	999
	999
JULIET	O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!	999
	Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?	999
	Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!	999
	Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!	999
	Despised substance of divinest show!	999
	Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,	999
	A damned saint, an honourable villain!	999
	O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,	999
	When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend	999
	In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?	999
	Was ever book containing such vile matter	999
	So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell	999
	In such a gorgeous palace!	999
	999
Nurse	There's no trust,	999
	No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,	999
	All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.	999
	Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:	999
	These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.	999
	Shame come to Romeo!	999
	999
JULIET	Blister'd be thy tongue	999
	For such a wish! he was not born to shame:	999
	Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;	999
	For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd	999
	Sole monarch of the universal earth.	999
	O, what a beast was I to chide at him!	999
	999
Nurse	Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?	999
	999
JULIET	Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?	999
	Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,	999
	When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?	999
	But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?	999
	That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:	999
	Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;	999
	Your tributary drops belong to woe,	999
	Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.	999
	My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;	999
	And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:	999
	All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?	999
	Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,	999
	That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;	999
	But, O, it presses to my memory,	999
	Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:	999
	'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'	999
	That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'	999
	Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death	999
	Was woe enough, if it had ended there:	999
	Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship	999
	And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,	999
	Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'	999
	Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,	999
	Which modern lamentations might have moved?	999
	But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,	999
	'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,	999
	Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,	999
	All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'	999
	There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,	999
	In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.	999
	Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?	999
	999
Nurse	Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:	999
	Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.	999
	999
JULIET	Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,	999
	When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.	999
	Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,	999
	Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:	999
	He made you for a highway to my bed;	999
	But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.	999
	Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;	999
	And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!	999
	999
Nurse	Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo	999
	To comfort you: I wot well where he is.	999
	Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:	999
	I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.	999
	999
JULIET	O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,	999
	And bid him come to take his last farewell.	999

	999
SCENE III	Friar Laurence's cell.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:	999
	Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,	999
	And thou art wedded to calamity.	999
	999
	[Enter ROMEO]	999
	999
ROMEO	Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?	999
	What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,	999
	That I yet know not?	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Too familiar	999
	Is my dear son with such sour company:	999
	I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.	999
	999
ROMEO	What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,	999
	Not body's death, but body's banishment.	999
	999
ROMEO	Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'	999
	For exile hath more terror in his look,	999
	Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hence from Verona art thou banished:	999
	Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.	999
	999
ROMEO	There is no world without Verona walls,	999
	But purgatory, torture, hell itself.	999
	Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,	999
	And world's exile is death: then banished,	999
	Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,	999
	Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,	999
	And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!	999
	Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,	999
	Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,	999
	And turn'd that black word death to banishment:	999
	This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.	999
	999
ROMEO	'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,	999
	Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog	999
	And little mouse, every unworthy thing,	999
	Live here in heaven and may look on her;	999
	But Romeo may not: more validity,	999
	More honourable state, more courtship lives	999
	In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize	999
	On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand	999
	And steal immortal blessing from her lips,	999
	Who even in pure and vestal modesty,	999
	Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;	999
	But Romeo may not; he is banished:	999
	Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:	999
	They are free men, but I am banished.	999
	And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?	999
	Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,	999
	No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,	999
	But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?	999
	O friar, the damned use that word in hell;	999
	Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,	999
	Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,	999
	A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,	999
	To mangle me with that word 'banished'?	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.	999
	999
ROMEO	O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:	999
	Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,	999
	To comfort thee, though thou art banished.	999
	999
ROMEO	Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!	999
	Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,	999
	Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,	999
	It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	O, then I see that madmen have no ears.	999
	999
ROMEO	How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.	999
	999
ROMEO	Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:	999
	Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,	999
	An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,	999
	Doting like me and like me banished,	999
	Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,	999
	And fall upon the ground, as I do now,	999
	Taking the measure of an unmade grave.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.	999
	999
ROMEO	Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,	999
	Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.	999
	999
	[Knocking]	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;	999
	Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;	999
	999
	[Knocking]	999
	999
	Run to my study. By and by! God's will,	999
	What simpleness is this! I come, I come!	999
	999
	[Knocking]	999
	999
	Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?	999
	999
Nurse	[Within]  Let me come in, and you shall know	999
	my errand;	999
	I come from Lady Juliet.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Welcome, then.	999
	999
	[Enter Nurse]	999
	999
Nurse	O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,	999
	Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.	999
	999
Nurse	O, he is even in my mistress' case,	999
	Just in her case! O woful sympathy!	999
	Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,	999
	Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.	999
	Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:	999
	For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;	999
	Why should you fall into so deep an O?	999
	999
ROMEO	Nurse!	999
	999
Nurse	Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.	999
	999
ROMEO	Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?	999
	Doth she not think me an old murderer,	999
	Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy	999
	With blood removed but little from her own?	999
	Where is she? and how doth she? and what says	999
	My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?	999
	999
Nurse	O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;	999
	And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,	999
	And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,	999
	And then down falls again.	999
	999
ROMEO	As if that name,	999
	Shot from the deadly level of a gun,	999
	Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand	999
	Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,	999
	In what vile part of this anatomy	999
	Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack	999
	The hateful mansion.	999
	999
	[Drawing his sword]	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold thy desperate hand:	999
	Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:	999
	Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote	999
	The unreasonable fury of a beast:	999
	Unseemly woman in a seeming man!	999
	Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!	999
	Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,	999
	I thought thy disposition better temper'd.	999
	Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?	999
	And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,	999
	By doing damned hate upon thyself?	999
	Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?	999
	Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet	999
	In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.	999
	Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;	999
	Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,	999
	And usest none in that true use indeed	999
	Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:	999
	Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,	999
	Digressing from the valour of a man;	999
	Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,	999
	Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;	999
	Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,	999
	Misshapen in the conduct of them both,	999
	Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,	999
	Is set afire by thine own ignorance,	999
	And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.	999
	What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,	999
	For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;	999
	There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,	999
	But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:	999
	The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend	999
	And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:	999
	A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;	999
	Happiness courts thee in her best array;	999
	But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,	999
	Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:	999
	Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.	999
	Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,	999
	Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:	999
	But look thou stay not till the watch be set,	999
	For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;	999
	Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time	999
	To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,	999
	Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back	999
	With twenty hundred thousand times more joy	999
	Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.	999
	Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;	999
	And bid her hasten all the house to bed,	999
	Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:	999
	Romeo is coming.	999
	999
Nurse	O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night	999
	To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!	999
	My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.	999
	999
ROMEO	Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.	999
	999
Nurse	Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:	999
	Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ROMEO	How well my comfort is revived by this!	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:	999
	Either be gone before the watch be set,	999
	Or by the break of day disguised from hence:	999
	Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,	999
	And he shall signify from time to time	999
	Every good hap to you that chances here:	999
	Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.	999
	999
ROMEO	But that a joy past joy calls out on me,	999
	It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS]	999
	999
CAPULET	Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,	999
	That we have had no time to move our daughter:	999
	Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,	999
	And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.	999
	'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:	999
	I promise you, but for your company,	999
	I would have been a-bed an hour ago.	999
	999
PARIS	These times of woe afford no time to woo.	999
	Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;	999
	To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.	999
	999
CAPULET	Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender	999
	Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled	999
	In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.	999
	Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;	999
	Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;	999
	And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--	999
	But, soft! what day is this?	999
	999
PARIS	Monday, my lord,	999
	999
CAPULET	Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,	999
	O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,	999
	She shall be married to this noble earl.	999
	Will you be ready? do you like this haste?	999
	We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;	999
	For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,	999
	It may be thought we held him carelessly,	999
	Being our kinsman, if we revel much:	999
	Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,	999
	And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?	999
	999
PARIS	My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.	999
	999
CAPULET	Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.	999
	Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,	999
	Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.	999
	Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!	999
	Afore me! it is so very very late,	999
	That we may call it early by and by.	999
	Good night.	999

	999
SCENE V	Capulet's orchard.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window]	999
	999
JULIET	Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:	999
	It was the nightingale, and not the lark,	999
	That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;	999
	Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:	999
	Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.	999
	999
ROMEO	It was the lark, the herald of the morn,	999
	No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks	999
	Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:	999
	Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day	999
	Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.	999
	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.	999
	999
JULIET	Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:	999
	It is some meteor that the sun exhales,	999
	To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,	999
	And light thee on thy way to Mantua:	999
	Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.	999
	999
ROMEO	Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;	999
	I am content, so thou wilt have it so.	999
	I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,	999
	'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;	999
	Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat	999
	The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:	999
	I have more care to stay than will to go:	999
	Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.	999
	How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.	999
	999
JULIET	It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!	999
	It is the lark that sings so out of tune,	999
	Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.	999
	Some say the lark makes sweet division;	999
	This doth not so, for she divideth us:	999
	Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,	999
	O, now I would they had changed voices too!	999
	Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,	999
	Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,	999
	O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.	999
	999
ROMEO	More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!	999
	999
	[Enter Nurse, to the chamber]	999
	999
Nurse	Madam!	999
	999
JULIET	Nurse?	999
	999
Nurse	Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:	999
	The day is broke; be wary, look about.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
JULIET	Then, window, let day in, and let life out.	999
	999
ROMEO	Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.	999
	999
	[He goeth down]	999
	999
JULIET	Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!	999
	I must hear from thee every day in the hour,	999
	For in a minute there are many days:	999
	O, by this count I shall be much in years	999
	Ere I again behold my Romeo!	999
	999
ROMEO	Farewell!	999
	I will omit no opportunity	999
	That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.	999
	999
JULIET	O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?	999
	999
ROMEO	I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve	999
	For sweet discourses in our time to come.	999
	999
JULIET	O God, I have an ill-divining soul!	999
	Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,	999
	As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:	999
	Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.	999
	999
ROMEO	And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:	999
	Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
JULIET	O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:	999
	If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.	999
	That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;	999
	For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,	999
	But send him back.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	[Within]         Ho, daughter! are you up?	999
	999
JULIET	Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?	999
	Is she not down so late, or up so early?	999
	What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?	999
	999
	[Enter LADY CAPULET]	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Why, how now, Juliet!	999
	999
JULIET	Madam, I am not well.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?	999
	What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?	999
	An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;	999
	Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;	999
	But much of grief shows still some want of wit.	999
	999
JULIET	Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend	999
	Which you weep for.	999
	999
JULIET	Feeling so the loss,	999
	Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,	999
	As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.	999
	999
JULIET	What villain madam?	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	That same villain, Romeo.	999
	999
JULIET	[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--	999
	God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;	999
	And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	That is, because the traitor murderer lives.	999
	999
JULIET	Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:	999
	Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:	999
	Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,	999
	Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,	999
	Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,	999
	That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:	999
	And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.	999
	999
JULIET	Indeed, I never shall be satisfied	999
	With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--	999
	Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.	999
	Madam, if you could find out but a man	999
	To bear a poison, I would temper it;	999
	That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,	999
	Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors	999
	To hear him named, and cannot come to him.	999
	To wreak the love I bore my cousin	999
	Upon his body that slaughter'd him!	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.	999
	But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.	999
	999
JULIET	And joy comes well in such a needy time:	999
	What are they, I beseech your ladyship?	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;	999
	One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,	999
	Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,	999
	That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.	999
	999
JULIET	Madam, in happy time, what day is that?	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,	999
	The gallant, young and noble gentleman,	999
	The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,	999
	Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.	999
	999
JULIET	Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,	999
	He shall not make me there a joyful bride.	999
	I wonder at this haste; that I must wed	999
	Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.	999
	I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,	999
	I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,	999
	It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,	999
	Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,	999
	And see how he will take it at your hands.	999
	999
	[Enter CAPULET and Nurse]	999
	999
CAPULET	When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;	999
	But for the sunset of my brother's son	999
	It rains downright.	999
	How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?	999
	Evermore showering? In one little body	999
	Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;	999
	For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,	999
	Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,	999
	Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;	999
	Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,	999
	Without a sudden calm, will overset	999
	Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!	999
	Have you deliver'd to her our decree?	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.	999
	I would the fool were married to her grave!	999
	999
CAPULET	Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.	999
	How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?	999
	Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,	999
	Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought	999
	So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?	999
	999
JULIET	Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:	999
	Proud can I never be of what I hate;	999
	But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.	999
	999
CAPULET	How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?	999
	'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'	999
	And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,	999
	Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,	999
	But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,	999
	To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,	999
	Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.	999
	Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!	999
	You tallow-face!	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	                  Fie, fie! what, are you mad?	999
	999
JULIET	Good father, I beseech you on my knees,	999
	Hear me with patience but to speak a word.	999
	999
CAPULET	Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!	999
	I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,	999
	Or never after look me in the face:	999
	Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;	999
	My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest	999
	That God had lent us but this only child;	999
	But now I see this one is one too much,	999
	And that we have a curse in having her:	999
	Out on her, hilding!	999
	999
Nurse	God in heaven bless her!	999
	You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.	999
	999
CAPULET	And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,	999
	Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.	999
	999
Nurse	I speak no treason.	999
	999
CAPULET	O, God ye god-den.	999
	999
Nurse	May not one speak?	999
	999
CAPULET	                  Peace, you mumbling fool!	999
	Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;	999
	For here we need it not.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	You are too hot.	999
	999
CAPULET	God's bread! it makes me mad:	999
	Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,	999
	Alone, in company, still my care hath been	999
	To have her match'd: and having now provided	999
	A gentleman of noble parentage,	999
	Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,	999
	Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,	999
	Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;	999
	And then to have a wretched puling fool,	999
	A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,	999
	To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,	999
	I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'	999
	But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:	999
	Graze where you will you shall not house with me:	999
	Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.	999
	Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:	999
	An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;	999
	And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in	999
	the streets,	999
	For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,	999
	Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:	999
	Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
JULIET	Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,	999
	That sees into the bottom of my grief?	999
	O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!	999
	Delay this marriage for a month, a week;	999
	Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed	999
	In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:	999
	Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
JULIET	O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?	999
	My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;	999
	How shall that faith return again to earth,	999
	Unless that husband send it me from heaven	999
	By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.	999
	Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems	999
	Upon so soft a subject as myself!	999
	What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?	999
	Some comfort, nurse.	999
	999
Nurse	Faith, here it is.	999
	Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,	999
	That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;	999
	Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.	999
	Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,	999
	I think it best you married with the county.	999
	O, he's a lovely gentleman!	999
	Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,	999
	Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye	999
	As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,	999
	I think you are happy in this second match,	999
	For it excels your first: or if it did not,	999
	Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,	999
	As living here and you no use of him.	999
	999
JULIET	Speakest thou from thy heart?	999
	999
Nurse	And from my soul too;	999
	Or else beshrew them both.	999
	999
JULIET	Amen!	999
	999
Nurse	What?	999
	999
JULIET	Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.	999
	Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,	999
	Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,	999
	To make confession and to be absolved.	999
	999
Nurse	Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
JULIET	Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!	999
	Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,	999
	Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue	999
	Which she hath praised him with above compare	999
	So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;	999
	Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.	999
	I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:	999
	If all else fail, myself have power to die.	999

	999
	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS]	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.	999
	999
PARIS	My father Capulet will have it so;	999
	And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	You say you do not know the lady's mind:	999
	Uneven is the course, I like it not.	999
	999
PARIS	Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,	999
	And therefore have I little talk'd of love;	999
	For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.	999
	Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous	999
	That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,	999
	And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,	999
	To stop the inundation of her tears;	999
	Which, too much minded by herself alone,	999
	May be put from her by society:	999
	Now do you know the reason of this haste.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	[Aside]  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.	999
	Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.	999
	999
	[Enter JULIET]	999
	999
PARIS	Happily met, my lady and my wife!	999
	999
JULIET	That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.	999
	999
PARIS	That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.	999
	999
JULIET	What must be shall be.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	That's a certain text.	999
	999
PARIS	Come you to make confession to this father?	999
	999
JULIET	To answer that, I should confess to you.	999
	999
PARIS	Do not deny to him that you love me.	999
	999
JULIET	I will confess to you that I love him.	999
	999
PARIS	So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.	999
	999
JULIET	If I do so, it will be of more price,	999
	Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.	999
	999
PARIS	Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.	999
	999
JULIET	The tears have got small victory by that;	999
	For it was bad enough before their spite.	999
	999
PARIS	Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.	999
	999
JULIET	That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;	999
	And what I spake, I spake it to my face.	999
	999
PARIS	Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.	999
	999
JULIET	It may be so, for it is not mine own.	999
	Are you at leisure, holy father, now;	999
	Or shall I come to you at evening mass?	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.	999
	My lord, we must entreat the time alone.	999
	999
PARIS	God shield I should disturb devotion!	999
	Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:	999
	Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
JULIET	O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,	999
	Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;	999
	It strains me past the compass of my wits:	999
	I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,	999
	On Thursday next be married to this county.	999
	999
JULIET	Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,	999
	Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:	999
	If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,	999
	Do thou but call my resolution wise,	999
	And with this knife I'll help it presently.	999
	God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;	999
	And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,	999
	Shall be the label to another deed,	999
	Or my true heart with treacherous revolt	999
	Turn to another, this shall slay them both:	999
	Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,	999
	Give me some present counsel, or, behold,	999
	'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife	999
	Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that	999
	Which the commission of thy years and art	999
	Could to no issue of true honour bring.	999
	Be not so long to speak; I long to die,	999
	If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,	999
	Which craves as desperate an execution.	999
	As that is desperate which we would prevent.	999
	If, rather than to marry County Paris,	999
	Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,	999
	Then is it likely thou wilt undertake	999
	A thing like death to chide away this shame,	999
	That copest with death himself to scape from it:	999
	And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.	999
	999
JULIET	O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,	999
	From off the battlements of yonder tower;	999
	Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk	999
	Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;	999
	Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,	999
	O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,	999
	With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;	999
	Or bid me go into a new-made grave	999
	And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;	999
	Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;	999
	And I will do it without fear or doubt,	999
	To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent	999
	To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:	999
	To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;	999
	Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:	999
	Take thou this vial, being then in bed,	999
	And this distilled liquor drink thou off;	999
	When presently through all thy veins shall run	999
	A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse	999
	Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:	999
	No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;	999
	The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade	999
	To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,	999
	Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;	999
	Each part, deprived of supple government,	999
	Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:	999
	And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death	999
	Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,	999
	And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.	999
	Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes	999
	To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:	999
	Then, as the manner of our country is,	999
	In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier	999
	Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault	999
	Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.	999
	In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,	999
	Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,	999
	And hither shall he come: and he and I	999
	Will watch thy waking, and that very night	999
	Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.	999
	And this shall free thee from this present shame;	999
	If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,	999
	Abate thy valour in the acting it.	999
	999
JULIET	Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous	999
	In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed	999
	To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.	999
	999
JULIET	Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.	999
	Farewell, dear father!	999

	Servingmen]	999
	999
CAPULET	So many guests invite as here are writ.	999
	999
	[Exit First Servant]	999
	999
	Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning cooks.	999
	999
Second Servant	You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they	999
	can lick their fingers.	999
	999
CAPULET	How canst thou try them so?	999
	999
Second Servant	Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his	999
	own fingers: therefore he that cannot lick his	999
	fingers goes not with me.	999
	999
CAPULET	Go, be gone.	999
	999
	[Exit Second Servant]	999
	999
	We shall be much unfurnished for this time.	999
	What, is my daughter gone to Friar Laurence?	999
	999
Nurse	Ay, forsooth.	999
	999
CAPULET	Well, he may chance to do some good on her:	999
	A peevish self-will'd harlotry it is.	999
	999
Nurse	See where she comes from shrift with merry look.	999
	999
	[Enter JULIET]	999
	999
CAPULET	How now, my headstrong! where have you been gadding?	999
	999
JULIET	Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin	999
	Of disobedient opposition	999
	To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd	999
	By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,	999
	And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!	999
	Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.	999
	999
CAPULET	Send for the county; go tell him of this:	999
	I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.	999
	999
JULIET	I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;	999
	And gave him what becomed love I might,	999
	Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.	999
	999
CAPULET	Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:	999
	This is as't should be. Let me see the county;	999
	Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.	999
	Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,	999
	Our whole city is much bound to him.	999
	999
JULIET	Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,	999
	To help me sort such needful ornaments	999
	As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.	999
	999
CAPULET	Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.	999
	999
	[Exeunt JULIET and Nurse]	999
	999
LADY  CAPULET	We shall be short in our provision:	999
	'Tis now near night.	999
	999
CAPULET	Tush, I will stir about,	999
	And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:	999
	Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;	999
	I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;	999
	I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!	999
	They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself	999
	To County Paris, to prepare him up	999
	Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,	999
	Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.	999

	[Enter JULIET and Nurse]	999
	999
JULIET	Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,	999
	I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,	999
	For I have need of many orisons	999
	To move the heavens to smile upon my state,	999
	Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.	999
	999
	[Enter LADY CAPULET]	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?	999
	999
JULIET	No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries	999
	As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:	999
	So please you, let me now be left alone,	999
	And let the nurse this night sit up with you;	999
	For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,	999
	In this so sudden business.	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Good night:	999
	Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.	999
	999
	[Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse]	999
	999
JULIET	Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.	999
	I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,	999
	That almost freezes up the heat of life:	999
	I'll call them back again to comfort me:	999
	Nurse! What should she do here?	999
	My dismal scene I needs must act alone.	999
	Come, vial.	999
	What if this mixture do not work at all?	999
	Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?	999
	No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.	999
	999
	[Laying down her dagger]	999
	999
	What if it be a poison, which the friar	999
	Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,	999
	Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,	999
	Because he married me before to Romeo?	999
	I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,	999
	For he hath still been tried a holy man.	999
	How if, when I am laid into the tomb,	999
	I wake before the time that Romeo	999
	Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!	999
	Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,	999
	To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,	999
	And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?	999
	Or, if I live, is it not very like,	999
	The horrible conceit of death and night,	999
	Together with the terror of the place,--	999
	As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,	999
	Where, for these many hundred years, the bones	999
	Of all my buried ancestors are packed:	999
	Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,	999
	Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,	999
	At some hours in the night spirits resort;--	999
	Alack, alack, is it not like that I,	999
	So early waking, what with loathsome smells,	999
	And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,	999
	That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--	999
	O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,	999
	Environed with all these hideous fears?	999
	And madly play with my forefather's joints?	999
	And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?	999
	And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,	999
	As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?	999
	O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost	999
	Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body	999
	Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!	999
	Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.	999

	Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,	999
	The County Paris hath set up his rest,	999
	That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,	999
	Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!	999
	I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!	999
	Ay, let the county take you in your bed;	999

	Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;	999

FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, is the bride ready to go to church?	999
	999
CAPULET	Ready to go, but never to return.	999
	O son! the night before thy wedding-day	999
	Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,	999
	Flower as she was, deflowered by him.	999
	Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;	999
	My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,	999
	And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.	999
	999
PARIS	Have I thought long to see this morning's face,	999
	And doth it give me such a sight as this?	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!	999
	Most miserable hour that e'er time saw	999
	In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!	999
	But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,	999
	But one thing to rejoice and solace in,	999
	And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!	999
	999
Nurse	O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!	999
	Most lamentable day, most woful day,	999

	O woful day, O woful day!	999

PARIS	Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!	999
	Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,	999

	999
CAPULET	Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!	999
	Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now	999
	To murder, murder our solemnity?	999
	O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!	999
	Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;	999
	And with my child my joys are buried.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not	999
	In these confusions. Heaven and yourself	999
	Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,	999
	And all the better is it for the maid:	999
	Your part in her you could not keep from death,	999
	But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.	999
	The most you sought was her promotion;	999
	For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:	999
	And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced	999
	Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?	999
	O, in this love, you love your child so ill,	999
	That you run mad, seeing that she is well:	999
	She's not well married that lives married long;	999
	But she's best married that dies married young.	999
	Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary	999
	On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,	999
	In all her best array bear her to church:	999
	For though fond nature bids us an lament,	999
	Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.	999
	999
CAPULET	All things that we ordained festival,	999
	Turn from their office to black funeral;	999
	Our instruments to melancholy bells,	999
	Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,	999
	Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,	999
	Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,	999
	And all things change them to the contrary.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;	999
	And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare	999
	To follow this fair corse unto her grave:	999
	The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;	999
	Move them no more by crossing their high will.	999
	999
	[Exeunt CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, PARIS, and FRIAR LAURENCE]	999
	999
First Musician	Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.	999
	999
Nurse	Honest goodfellows, ah, put up, put up;	999
	For, well you know, this is a pitiful case.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
First Musician	Ay, by my troth, the case may be amended.	999
	999
	[Enter PETER]	999
	999
PETER	Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's	999
	ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'	999
	999
First Musician	Why 'Heart's ease?'	999
	999
PETER	O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My	999
	heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,	999
	to comfort me.	999
	999
First Musician	Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.	999
	999
PETER	You will not, then?	999
	999
First Musician	No.	999
	999
PETER	I will then give it you soundly.	999
	999
First Musician	What will you give us?	999
	999
PETER	No money, on my faith, but the gleek;	999
	I will give you the minstrel.	999
	999
First Musician	Then I will give you the serving-creature.	999
	999
PETER	Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on	999
	your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,	999
	I'll fa you; do you note me?	999
	999
First Musician	An you re us and fa us, you note us.	999
	999
Second Musician	Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.	999
	999
PETER	Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you	999
	with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer	999
	me like men:	999
	'When griping grief the heart doth wound,	999
	And doleful dumps the mind oppress,	999
	Then music with her silver sound'--	999
	why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver	999
	sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?	999
	999
Musician	Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.	999
	999
PETER	Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?	999
	999
Second Musician	I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.	999
	999
PETER	Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?	999
	999
Third Musician	Faith, I know not what to say.	999
	999
PETER	O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say	999
	for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'	999
	because musicians have no gold for sounding:	999
	'Then music with her silver sound	999
	With speedy help doth lend redress.'	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
First Musician	What a pestilent knave is this same!	999
	999
Second Musician	Hang him, Jack! Come, we'll in here; tarry for the	999

SCENE I	Mantua. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ROMEO]	999
	999
ROMEO	If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,	999
	My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:	999
	My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;	999
	And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit	999
	Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.	999
	I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--	999
	Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave	999
	to think!--	999
	And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,	999
	That I revived, and was an emperor.	999
	Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,	999
	When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!	999
	999
	[Enter BALTHASAR, booted]	999
	999
	News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!	999
	Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?	999
	How doth my lady? Is my father well?	999
	How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;	999
	For nothing can be ill, if she be well.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:	999
	Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,	999
	And her immortal part with angels lives.	999
	I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,	999
	And presently took post to tell it you:	999
	O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,	999
	Since you did leave it for my office, sir.	999
	999
ROMEO	Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!	999
	Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,	999
	And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	I do beseech you, sir, have patience:	999
	Your looks are pale and wild, and do import	999
	Some misadventure.	999
	999
ROMEO	                  Tush, thou art deceived:	999
	Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.	999
	Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?	999
	999
BALTHASAR	No, my good lord.	999
	999
ROMEO	                  No matter: get thee gone,	999
	And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.	999
	999
	[Exit BALTHASAR]	999
	999
	Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.	999
	Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift	999
	To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!	999
	I do remember an apothecary,--	999
	And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted	999
	In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,	999
	Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,	999
	Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:	999
	And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,	999
	An alligator stuff'd, and other skins	999
	Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves	999
	A beggarly account of empty boxes,	999
	Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,	999
	Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,	999
	Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.	999
	Noting this penury, to myself I said	999
	'An if a man did need a poison now,	999
	Whose sale is present death in Mantua,	999
	Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'	999
	O, this same thought did but forerun my need;	999
	And this same needy man must sell it me.	999
	As I remember, this should be the house.	999
	Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.	999
	What, ho! apothecary!	999
	999
	[Enter Apothecary]	999
	999
Apothecary	Who calls so loud?	999
	999
ROMEO	Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:	999
	Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have	999
	A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear	999
	As will disperse itself through all the veins	999
	That the life-weary taker may fall dead	999
	And that the trunk may be discharged of breath	999
	As violently as hasty powder fired	999
	Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.	999
	999
Apothecary	Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law	999
	Is death to any he that utters them.	999
	999
ROMEO	Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,	999
	And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,	999
	Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,	999
	Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;	999
	The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;	999
	The world affords no law to make thee rich;	999
	Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.	999
	999
Apothecary	My poverty, but not my will, consents.	999
	999
ROMEO	I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.	999
	999
Apothecary	Put this in any liquid thing you will,	999
	And drink it off; and, if you had the strength	999
	Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.	999
	999
ROMEO	There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,	999
	Doing more murders in this loathsome world,	999
	Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.	999
	I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.	999
	Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.	999
	Come, cordial and not poison, go with me	999
	To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.	999

	999
FRIAR JOHN	Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!	999
	999
	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	This same should be the voice of Friar John.	999
	Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?	999
	Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.	999
	999
FRIAR JOHN	Going to find a bare-foot brother out	999
	One of our order, to associate me,	999
	Here in this city visiting the sick,	999
	And finding him, the searchers of the town,	999
	Suspecting that we both were in a house	999
	Where the infectious pestilence did reign,	999
	Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;	999
	So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?	999
	999
FRIAR JOHN	I could not send it,--here it is again,--	999
	Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,	999
	So fearful were they of infection.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,	999
	The letter was not nice but full of charge	999
	Of dear import, and the neglecting it	999
	May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;	999
	Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight	999
	Unto my cell.	999
	999
FRIAR JOHN	Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Now must I to the monument alone;	999
	Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:	999
	She will beshrew me much that Romeo	999
	Hath had no notice of these accidents;	999
	But I will write again to Mantua,	999
	And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;	999
	Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!	999

SCENE III	A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch]	999
	999
PARIS	Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:	999
	Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.	999
	Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,	999
	Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;	999
	So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,	999
	Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,	999
	But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,	999
	As signal that thou hear'st something approach.	999
	Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.	999
	999
PAGE	[Aside]  I am almost afraid to stand alone	999
	Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.	999
	999
	[Retires]	999
	999
PARIS	Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--	999
	O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--	999
	Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,	999
	Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:	999
	The obsequies that I for thee will keep	999
	Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.	999
	999
	[The Page whistles]	999
	999
	The boy gives warning something doth approach.	999
	What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,	999
	To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?	999
	What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.	999
	999
	[Retires]	999
	999
	[Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch,	999
	mattock, &c]	999
	999
ROMEO	Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.	999
	Hold, take this letter; early in the morning	999
	See thou deliver it to my lord and father.	999
	Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,	999
	Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,	999
	And do not interrupt me in my course.	999
	Why I descend into this bed of death,	999
	Is partly to behold my lady's face;	999
	But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger	999
	A precious ring, a ring that I must use	999
	In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:	999
	But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry	999
	In what I further shall intend to do,	999
	By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint	999
	And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:	999
	The time and my intents are savage-wild,	999
	More fierce and more inexorable far	999
	Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.	999
	999
ROMEO	So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:	999
	Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	[Aside]  For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:	999
	His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.	999
	999
	[Retires]	999
	999
ROMEO	Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,	999
	Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,	999
	Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,	999
	And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!	999
	999
	[Opens the tomb]	999
	999
PARIS	This is that banish'd haughty Montague,	999
	That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,	999
	It is supposed, the fair creature died;	999
	And here is come to do some villanous shame	999
	To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.	999
	999
	[Comes forward]	999
	999
	Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!	999
	Can vengeance be pursued further than death?	999
	Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:	999
	Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.	999
	999
ROMEO	I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.	999
	Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;	999
	Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;	999
	Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,	999
	Put not another sin upon my head,	999
	By urging me to fury: O, be gone!	999
	By heaven, I love thee better than myself;	999
	For I come hither arm'd against myself:	999
	Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,	999
	A madman's mercy bade thee run away.	999
	999
PARIS	I do defy thy conjurations,	999
	And apprehend thee for a felon here.	999
	999
ROMEO	Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!	999
	999

	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
ROMEO	In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.	999
	Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!	999
	What said my man, when my betossed soul	999
	Did not attend him as we rode? I think	999
	He told me Paris should have married Juliet:	999
	Said he not so? or did I dream it so?	999
	Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,	999
	To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,	999
	One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!	999
	I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;	999
	A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,	999
	For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes	999
	This vault a feasting presence full of light.	999
	Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.	999
	999
	[Laying PARIS in the tomb]	999
	999
	How oft when men are at the point of death	999
	Have they been merry! which their keepers call	999
	A lightning before death: O, how may I	999
	Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!	999
	Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,	999
	Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:	999
	Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet	999
	Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,	999
	And death's pale flag is not advanced there.	999
	Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?	999
	O, what more favour can I do to thee,	999
	Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain	999
	To sunder his that was thine enemy?	999
	Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,	999
	Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe	999
	That unsubstantial death is amorous,	999
	And that the lean abhorred monster keeps	999
	Thee here in dark to be his paramour?	999
	For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;	999
	And never from this palace of dim night	999
	Depart again: here, here will I remain	999
	With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here	999
	Will I set up my everlasting rest,	999
	And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars	999
	From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!	999
	Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you	999
	The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss	999
	A dateless bargain to engrossing death!	999
	Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!	999
	Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on	999
	The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!	999
	Here's to my love!	999
	999
	[Drinks]	999
	999
	O true apothecary!	999
	Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.	999

FRIAR LAURENCE	Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night	999
	Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?	999
	999
BALTHASAR	Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,	999
	What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light	999
	To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,	999
	It burneth in the Capel's monument.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,	999
	One that you love.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	                  Who is it?	999
	999
BALTHASAR	Romeo.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	How long hath he been there?	999
	999
BALTHASAR	Full half an hour.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Go with me to the vault.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	I dare not, sir	999
	My master knows not but I am gone hence;	999
	And fearfully did menace me with death,	999
	If I did stay to look on his intents.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:	999
	O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,	999
	I dreamt my master and another fought,	999
	And that my master slew him.	999
	999

	999
	[Advances]	999
	999
	Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains	999

	999
	[Enters the tomb]	999
	999
	Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?	999
	And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour	999

	[Noise within]	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest	999
	Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:	999
	A greater power than we can contradict	999
	Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.	999
	Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;	999
	And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee	999
	Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:	999
	Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;	999
	Come, go, good Juliet,	999
	999
	[Noise again]	999
	999
		 I dare no longer stay.	999
	999
JULIET	Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.	999
	999
	[Exit FRIAR LAURENCE]	999
	999
	What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?	999
	Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:	999
	O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop	999
	To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;	999
	Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,	999
	To make die with a restorative.	999
	999
	[Kisses him]	999
	999
	Thy lips are warm.	999
	999
First Watchman	[Within]  Lead, boy: which way?	999
	999
JULIET	Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!	999
	999
	[Snatching ROMEO's dagger]	999
	999
	This is thy sheath;	999
	999
	[Stabs herself]	999
	999
	there rust, and let me die.	999
	999
	[Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies]	999
	999
	[Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS]	999
	999
PAGE	This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.	999
	999
First Watchman	The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:	999
	Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.	999
	Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,	999
	And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,	999
	Who here hath lain these two days buried.	999
	Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:	999
	Raise up the Montagues: some others search:	999
	We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;	999
	But the true ground of all these piteous woes	999
	We cannot without circumstance descry.	999
	999
	[Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR]	999
	999
Second Watchman	Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.	999
	999
First Watchman	Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.	999
	999
	[Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE]	999
	999
Third Watchman	Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:	999
	We took this mattock and this spade from him,	999
	As he was coming from this churchyard side.	999
	999
First Watchman	A great suspicion: stay the friar too.	999
	999
	[Enter the PRINCE and Attendants]	999
	999
PRINCE	What misadventure is so early up,	999
	That calls our person from our morning's rest?	999
	999
	[Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others]	999
	999
CAPULET	What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	The people in the street cry Romeo,	999
	Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,	999
	With open outcry toward our monument.	999
	999
PRINCE	What fear is this which startles in our ears?	999
	999
First Watchman	Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;	999
	And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,	999
	Warm and new kill'd.	999
	999
PRINCE	Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.	999
	999
First Watchman	Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;	999
	With instruments upon them, fit to open	999
	These dead men's tombs.	999
	999
CAPULET	O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!	999
	This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house	999
	Is empty on the back of Montague,--	999
	And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!	999
	999
LADY CAPULET	O me! this sight of death is as a bell,	999
	That warns my old age to a sepulchre.	999
	999
	[Enter MONTAGUE and others]	999
	999
PRINCE	Come, Montague; for thou art early up,	999
	To see thy son and heir more early down.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;	999
	Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:	999
	What further woe conspires against mine age?	999
	999
PRINCE	Look, and thou shalt see.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	O thou untaught! what manners is in this?	999
	To press before thy father to a grave?	999
	999
PRINCE	Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,	999
	Till we can clear these ambiguities,	999
	And know their spring, their head, their	999
	true descent;	999
	And then will I be general of your woes,	999
	And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,	999
	And let mischance be slave to patience.	999
	Bring forth the parties of suspicion.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	I am the greatest, able to do least,	999
	Yet most suspected, as the time and place	999
	Doth make against me of this direful murder;	999
	And here I stand, both to impeach and purge	999
	Myself condemned and myself excused.	999
	999
PRINCE	Then say at once what thou dost know in this.	999
	999
FRIAR LAURENCE	I will be brief, for my short date of breath	999
	Is not so long as is a tedious tale.	999
	Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;	999
	And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:	999
	I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day	999
	Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death	999
	Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,	999
	For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.	999
	You, to remove that siege of grief from her,	999
	Betroth'd and would have married her perforce	999
	To County Paris: then comes she to me,	999
	And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean	999
	To rid her from this second marriage,	999
	Or in my cell there would she kill herself.	999
	Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,	999
	A sleeping potion; which so took effect	999
	As I intended, for it wrought on her	999
	The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,	999
	That he should hither come as this dire night,	999
	To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,	999
	Being the time the potion's force should cease.	999
	But he which bore my letter, Friar John,	999
	Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight	999
	Return'd my letter back. Then all alone	999
	At the prefixed hour of her waking,	999
	Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;	999
	Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,	999
	Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:	999
	But when I came, some minute ere the time	999
	Of her awaking, here untimely lay	999
	The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.	999
	She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,	999
	And bear this work of heaven with patience:	999
	But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;	999
	And she, too desperate, would not go with me,	999
	But, as it seems, did violence on herself.	999
	All this I know; and to the marriage	999
	Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this	999
	Miscarried by my fault, let my old life	999
	Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,	999
	Unto the rigour of severest law.	999
	999
PRINCE	We still have known thee for a holy man.	999
	Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?	999
	999
BALTHASAR	I brought my master news of Juliet's death;	999
	And then in post he came from Mantua	999
	To this same place, to this same monument.	999
	This letter he early bid me give his father,	999
	And threatened me with death, going in the vault,	999
	I departed not and left him there.	999
	999
PRINCE	Give me the letter; I will look on it.	999
	Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?	999
	Sirrah, what made your master in this place?	999
	999
PAGE	He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;	999
	And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:	999
	Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;	999
	And by and by my master drew on him;	999
	And then I ran away to call the watch.	999
	999
PRINCE	This letter doth make good the friar's words,	999
	Their course of love, the tidings of her death:	999
	And here he writes that he did buy a poison	999
	Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal	999
	Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.	999
	Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!	999
	See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,	999
	That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.	999
	And I for winking at your discords too	999
	Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.	999
	999
CAPULET	O brother Montague, give me thy hand:	999
	This is my daughter's jointure, for no more	999
	Can I demand.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	                  But I can give thee more:	999
	For I will raise her statue in pure gold;	999
	That while Verona by that name is known,	999
	There shall no figure at such rate be set	999
	As that of true and faithful Juliet.	999
	999
CAPULET	As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;	999
	Poor sacrifices of our enmity!	999
	999
PRINCE	A glooming peace this morning with it brings;	999
	The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:	999
	Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;	999
	Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:	999
	For never was a story of more woe	999
	Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.	999

SCENE I	Rome. Before the Capitol.	999

	999
	[The Tomb of the ANDRONICI appearing; the Tribunes	999
	and Senators aloft. Enter, below, from one side,	999
	SATURNINUS and his Followers; and, from the other	999
	side, BASSIANUS and his Followers; with drum and colours]	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Noble patricians, patrons of my right,	999
	Defend the justice of my cause with arms,	999
	And, countrymen, my loving followers,	999
	Plead my successive title with your swords:	999
	I am his first-born son, that was the last	999
	That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;	999
	Then let my father's honours live in me,	999
	Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.	999
	999
BASSIANUS	Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,	999
	If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,	999
	Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,	999
	Keep then this passage to the Capitol	999
	And suffer not dishonour to approach	999
	The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,	999
	To justice, continence and nobility;	999
	But let desert in pure election shine,	999
	And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.	999
	999
	[Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS, aloft, with the crown]	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Princes, that strive by factions and by friends	999
	Ambitiously for rule and empery,	999
	Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand	999
	A special party, have, by common voice,	999
	In election for the Roman empery,	999
	Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius	999
	For many good and great deserts to Rome:	999
	A nobler man, a braver warrior,	999
	Lives not this day within the city walls:	999
	He by the senate is accit'd home	999
	From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;	999
	That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,	999
	Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms.	999
	Ten years are spent since first he undertook	999
	This cause of Rome and chastised with arms	999
	Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd	999
	Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons	999
	In coffins from the field;	999
	And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,	999
	Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,	999
	Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.	999
	Let us entreat, by honour of his name,	999
	Whom worthily you would have now succeed.	999
	And in the Capitol and senate's right,	999
	Whom you pretend to honour and adore,	999
	That you withdraw you and abate your strength;	999
	Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,	999
	Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!	999
	999
BASSIANUS	Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally	999
	In thy uprightness and integrity,	999
	And so I love and honour thee and thine,	999
	Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,	999
	And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,	999
	Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,	999
	That I will here dismiss my loving friends,	999
	And to my fortunes and the people's favor	999
	Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.	999
	999
	[Exeunt the followers of BASSIANUS]	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,	999
	I thank you all and here dismiss you all,	999
	And to the love and favor of my country	999
	Commit myself, my person and the cause.	999
	999
	[Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS]	999

	As I am confident and kind to thee.	999
	Open the gates, and let me in.	999

	[Enter a Captain]	999
	999
Captain	Romans, make way: the good Andronicus.	999
	Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,	999
	Successful in the battles that he fights,	999
	With honour and with fortune is return'd	999
	From where he circumscribed with his sword,	999
	And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.	999
	999
	[Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and	999
	MUTIUS; After them, two Men bearing a coffin	999
	covered with black; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS. After	999
	them, TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA, with	999
	ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, AARON, and other Goths,	999
	prisoners; Soldiers and people following. The	999
	Bearers set down the coffin, and TITUS speaks]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!	999
	Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,	999
	Returns with precious jading to the bay	999
	From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,	999
	Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,	999
	To re-salute his country with his tears,	999
	Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.	999
	Thou great defender of this Capitol,	999
	Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!	999
	Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,	999
	Half of the number that King Priam had,	999
	Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!	999
	These that survive let Rome reward with love;	999
	These that I bring unto their latest home,	999
	With burial amongst their ancestors:	999
	Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.	999
	Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,	999
	Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,	999
	To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?	999
	Make way to lay them by their brethren.	999
	999
	[The tomb is opened]	999
	999
	There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,	999
	And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!	999
	O sacred receptacle of my joys,	999
	Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,	999
	How many sons of mine hast thou in store,	999
	That thou wilt never render to me more!	999
	999
LUCIUS	Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,	999
	That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile	999
	Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,	999
	Before this earthy prison of their bones;	999
	That so the shadows be not unappeased,	999
	Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	I give him you, the noblest that survives,	999
	The eldest son of this distressed queen.	999
	999
TAMORA	Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,	999
	Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,	999
	A mother's tears in passion for her son:	999
	And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,	999
	O, think my son to be as dear to me!	999
	Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,	999
	To beautify thy triumphs and return,	999
	Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,	999
	But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,	999
	For valiant doings in their country's cause?	999
	O, if to fight for king and commonweal	999
	Were piety in thine, it is in these.	999
	Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:	999
	Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?	999
	Draw near them then in being merciful:	999
	Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:	999
	Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.	999
	These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld	999
	Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain	999
	Religiously they ask a sacrifice:	999
	To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,	999
	To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Away with him! and make a fire straight;	999
	And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,	999
	Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.	999
	999
	[Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS, and MUTIUS, with ALARBUS]	999
	999
TAMORA	O cruel, irreligious piety!	999
	999
CHIRON	Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.	999
	Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive	999
	To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.	999
	Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal	999
	The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy	999
	With opportunity of sharp revenge	999
	Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,	999
	May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths--	999
	When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen--	999
	To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.	999
	999
	[Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS and MUTIUS, with	999
	their swords bloody]	999
	999
LUCIUS	See, lord and father, how we have perform'd	999
	Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,	999
	And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,	999
	Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.	999
	Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,	999
	And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Let it be so; and let Andronicus	999
	Make this his latest farewell to their souls.	999
	999
	[Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb]	999
	999
	In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;	999
	Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,	999
	Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!	999
	Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,	999
	Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,	999
	No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:	999
	In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!	999
	999
	[Enter LAVINIA]	999
	999
LAVINIA	In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;	999
	My noble lord and father, live in fame!	999
	Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears	999
	I render, for my brethren's obsequies;	999
	And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy,	999
	Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:	999
	O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,	999
	Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved	999
	The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!	999
	Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,	999
	And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!	999
	999
	[Enter, below, MARCUS ANDRONICUS and Tribunes;	999
	re-enter SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS, attended]	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,	999
	Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,	999
	You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!	999
	Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,	999
	That in your country's service drew your swords:	999
	But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,	999
	That hath aspired to Solon's happiness	999
	And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.	999
	Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,	999
	Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,	999
	Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,	999
	This palliament of white and spotless hue;	999
	And name thee in election for the empire,	999
	With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:	999
	Be candidatus then, and put it on,	999
	And help to set a head on headless Rome.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	A better head her glorious body fits	999
	Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:	999
	What should I don this robe, and trouble you?	999
	Be chosen with proclamations to-day,	999
	To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,	999
	And set abroad new business for you all?	999
	Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,	999
	And led my country's strength successfully,	999
	And buried one and twenty valiant sons,	999
	Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,	999
	In right and service of their noble country	999
	Give me a staff of honour for mine age,	999
	But not a sceptre to control the world:	999
	Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Patience, Prince Saturninus.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Romans, do me right:	999
	Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not	999
	Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.	999
	Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell,	999
	Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!	999
	999
LUCIUS	Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good	999
	That noble-minded Titus means to thee!	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee	999
	The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.	999
	999
BASSIANUS	Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,	999
	But honour thee, and will do till I die:	999
	My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,	999
	I will most thankful be; and thanks to men	999
	Of noble minds is honourable meed.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,	999
	I ask your voices and your suffrages:	999
	Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?	999
	999
Tribunes	To gratify the good Andronicus,	999
	And gratulate his safe return to Rome,	999
	The people will accept whom he admits.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make,	999
	That you create your emperor's eldest son,	999
	Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,	999
	Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,	999
	And ripen justice in this commonweal:	999
	Then, if you will elect by my advice,	999
	Crown him and say 'Long live our emperor!'	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	With voices and applause of every sort,	999
	Patricians and plebeians, we create	999
	Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,	999
	And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'	999
	999
	[A long flourish till they come down]	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done	999
	To us in our election this day,	999
	I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,	999
	And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:	999
	And, for an onset, Titus, to advance	999
	Thy name and honourable family,	999
	Lavinia will I make my empress,	999
	Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,	999
	And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse:	999
	Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match	999
	I hold me highly honour'd of your grace:	999
	And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,	999
	King and commander of our commonweal,	999
	The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate	999
	My sword, my chariot and my prisoners;	999
	Presents well worthy Rome's imperial lord:	999
	Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,	999
	Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!	999
	How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts	999
	Rome shall record, and when I do forget	999
	The least of these unspeakable deserts,	999
	Romans, forget your fealty to me.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	[To TAMORA]  Now, madam, are you prisoner to	999
	an emperor;	999
	To him that, for your honour and your state,	999
	Will use you nobly and your followers.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue	999
	That I would choose, were I to choose anew.	999
	Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:	999
	Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,	999
	Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome:	999
	Princely shall be thy usage every way.	999
	Rest on my word, and let not discontent	999
	Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you	999
	Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.	999
	Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?	999
	999
LAVINIA	Not I, my lord; sith true nobility	999
	Warrants these words in princely courtesy.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;	999
	Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:	999
	Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.	999
	999
	[Flourish. SATURNINUS courts TAMORA in dumb show]	999
	999
BASSIANUS	Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.	999
	999
	[Seizing LAVINIA]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	How, sir! are you in earnest then, my lord?	999
	999
BASSIANUS	Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withal	999
	To do myself this reason and this right.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:	999
	This prince in justice seizeth but his own.	999
	999
LUCIUS	And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?	999
	Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Surprised! by whom?	999
	999
BASSIANUS	By him that justly may	999
	Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BASSIANUS and MARCUS with LAVINIA]	999
	999
MUTIUS	Brothers, help to convey her hence away,	999
	And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.	999
	999
	[Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.	999
	999
MUTIUS	My lord, you pass not here.	999
	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	What, villain boy!	999
	Barr'st me my way in Rome?	999
	999
	[Stabbing MUTIUS]	999
	999
MUTIUS	Help, Lucius, help!	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
	[During the fray, SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS,	999
	CHIRON and AARON go out and re-enter, above]	999
	999
	[Re-enter LUCIUS]	999
	999
LUCIUS	My lord, you are unjust, and, more than so,	999
	In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;	999
	My sons would never so dishonour me:	999
	Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,	999
	That is another's lawful promised love.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SATURNINUS	No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not,	999
	Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:	999
	I'll trust, by leisure, him that mocks me once;	999
	Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,	999
	Confederates all thus to dishonour me.	999
	Was there none else in Rome to make a stale,	999
	But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,	999
	Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine,	999
	That said'st I begg'd the empire at thy hands.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?	999
	999
SATURNINUS	But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece	999
	To him that flourish'd for her with his sword	999
	A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;	999
	One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,	999
	To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	These words are razors to my wounded heart.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	And therefore, lovely Tamora, queen of Goths,	999
	That like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs	999
	Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,	999
	If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,	999
	Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,	999
	And will create thee empress of Rome,	999
	Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?	999
	And here I swear by all the Roman gods,	999
	Sith priest and holy water are so near	999
	And tapers burn so bright and every thing	999
	In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,	999
	I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,	999
	Or climb my palace, till from forth this place	999
	I lead espoused my bride along with me.	999
	999
TAMORA	And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear,	999
	If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,	999
	She will a handmaid be to his desires,	999
	A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany	999
	Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,	999
	Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,	999
	Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:	999
	There shall we consummate our spousal rites.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but TITUS]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	I am not bid to wait upon this bride.	999
	Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,	999
	Dishonour'd thus, and challenged of wrongs?	999
	999
	[Re-enter MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS]	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!	999
	In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,	999
	Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed	999
	That hath dishonour'd all our family;	999
	Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!	999
	999
LUCIUS	But let us give him burial, as becomes;	999
	Give Mutius burial with our brethren.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb:	999
	This monument five hundred years hath stood,	999
	Which I have sumptuously re-edified:	999
	Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors	999
	Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:	999
	Bury him where you can; he comes not here.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	My lord, this is impiety in you:	999
	My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him	999
	He must be buried with his brethren.	999
	999
QUINTUS	|	999
	| And shall, or him we will accompany.	999
MARTIUS	|	999
	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	'And shall!' what villain was it that spake	999
	that word?	999
	999
QUINTUS	He that would vouch it in any place but here.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	What, would you bury him in my despite?	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee	999
	To pardon Mutius and to bury him.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,	999
	And, with these boys, mine honour thou hast wounded:	999
	My foes I do repute you every one;	999
	So, trouble me no more, but get you gone.	999
	999
MARTIUS	He is not with himself; let us withdraw.	999
	999
QUINTUS	Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.	999
	999
	[MARCUS and the Sons of TITUS kneel]	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,--	999
	999
QUINTUS	Father, and in that name doth nature speak,--	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,--	999
	999
LUCIUS	Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter	999
	His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,	999
	That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.	999
	Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous:	999
	The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax	999
	That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son	999
	Did graciously plead for his funerals:	999
	Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy	999
	Be barr'd his entrance here.	999
	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Rise, Marcus, rise.	999
	The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,	999
	To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome!	999
	Well, bury him, and bury me the next.	999
	999
	[MUTIUS is put into the tomb]	999
	999
LUCIUS	There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,	999
	Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.	999
	999
All	[Kneeling]  No man shed tears for noble Mutius;	999
	He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,	999
	How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths	999
	Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	I know not, Marcus; but I know it is,	999
	Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell:	999
	Is she not then beholding to the man	999
	That brought her for this high good turn so far?	999
	Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.	999
	999
	[Flourish. Re-enter, from one side, SATURNINUS	999
	attended, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON and AARON; from	999
	the other, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, and others]	999
	999
SATURNINUS	So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:	999
	God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!	999
	999
BASSIANUS	And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,	999
	Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,	999
	Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.	999
	999
BASSIANUS	Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,	999
	My truth-betrothed love and now my wife?	999
	But let the laws of Rome determine all;	999
	Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	'Tis good, sir: you are very short with us;	999
	But, if we live, we'll be as sharp with you.	999
	999
BASSIANUS	My lord, what I have done, as best I may,	999
	Answer I must and shall do with my life.	999
	Only thus much I give your grace to know:	999
	By all the duties that I owe to Rome,	999
	This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,	999
	Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd;	999
	That in the rescue of Lavinia	999
	With his own hand did slay his youngest son,	999
	In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath	999
	To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:	999
	Receive him, then, to favor, Saturnine,	999
	That hath express'd himself in all his deeds	999
	A father and a friend to thee and Rome.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:	999
	'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me.	999
	Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,	999
	How I have loved and honour'd Saturnine!	999
	999
TAMORA	My worthy lord, if ever Tamora	999
	Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,	999
	Then hear me speak in indifferently for all;	999
	And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	What, madam! be dishonour'd openly,	999
	And basely put it up without revenge?	999
	999
TAMORA	Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend	999
	I should be author to dishonour you!	999
	But on mine honour dare I undertake	999
	For good Lord Titus' innocence in all;	999
	Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs:	999
	Then, at my suit, look graciously on him;	999
	Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,	999
	Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.	999
	[Aside to SATURNINUS]  My lord, be ruled by me,	999
	be won at last;	999
	Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:	999
	You are but newly planted in your throne;	999
	Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,	999
	Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,	999
	And so supplant you for ingratitude,	999
	Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,	999
	Yield at entreats; and then let me alone:	999
	I'll find a day to massacre them all	999
	And raze their faction and their family,	999
	The cruel father and his traitorous sons,	999
	To whom I sued for my dear son's life,	999
	And make them know what 'tis to let a queen	999
	Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.	999
	999
	[Aloud]	999
	999
	Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus;	999
	Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart	999
	That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevail'd.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	I thank your majesty, and her, my lord:	999
	These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.	999
	999
TAMORA	Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,	999
	A Roman now adopted happily,	999
	And must advise the emperor for his good.	999
	This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;	999
	And let it be mine honour, good my lord,	999
	That I have reconciled your friends and you.	999
	For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd	999
	My word and promise to the emperor,	999
	That you will be more mild and tractable.	999
	And fear not lords, and you, Lavinia;	999
	By my advice, all humbled on your knees,	999
	You shall ask pardon of his majesty.	999
	999
LUCIUS	We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness,	999
	That what we did was mildly as we might,	999
	Tendering our sister's honour and our own.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	That, on mine honour, here I do protest.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.	999
	999
TAMORA	Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:	999
	The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;	999
	I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here,	999
	And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,	999
	I do remit these young men's heinous faults: Stand up.	999
	Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,	999
	I found a friend, and sure as death I swore	999
	I would not part a bachelor from the priest.	999
	Come, if the emperor's court can feast two brides,	999
	You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.	999
	This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	To-morrow, an it please your majesty	999
	To hunt the panther and the hart with me,	999
	With horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Rome. Before the Palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter AARON]	999
	999
AARON	Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,	999
	Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,	999
	Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;	999
	Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.	999
	As when the golden sun salutes the morn,	999
	And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,	999
	Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,	999
	And overlooks the highest-peering hills;	999
	So Tamora:	999
	Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,	999
	And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.	999
	Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,	999
	To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,	999
	And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long	999
	Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains	999
	And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes	999
	Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.	999
	Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!	999
	I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,	999
	To wait upon this new-made empress.	999
	To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,	999
	This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,	999
	This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,	999
	And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.	999
	Holloa! what storm is this?	999
	999
	[Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, braving]	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,	999
	And manners, to intrude where I am graced;	999
	And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.	999
	999
CHIRON	Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;	999
	And so in this, to bear me down with braves.	999
	'Tis not the difference of a year or two	999
	Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:	999
	I am as able and as fit as thou	999
	To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;	999
	And that my sword upon thee shall approve,	999
	And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.	999
	999
AARON	[Aside]  Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep	999
	the peace.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,	999
	Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,	999
	Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?	999
	Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath	999
	Till you know better how to handle it.	999
	999
CHIRON	Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,	999
	Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?	999
	999
	[They draw]	999
	999
AARON	[Coming forward]  Why, how now, lords!	999
	So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,	999
	And maintain such a quarrel openly?	999
	Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:	999
	I would not for a million of gold	999
	The cause were known to them it most concerns;	999
	Nor would your noble mother for much more	999
	Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.	999
	For shame, put up.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	                  Not I, till I have sheathed	999
	My rapier in his bosom and withal	999
	Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat	999
	That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.	999
	999
CHIRON	For that I am prepared and full resolved.	999
	Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,	999
	And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!	999
	999
AARON	Away, I say!	999
	Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,	999
	This petty brabble will undo us all.	999
	Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous	999
	It is to jet upon a prince's right?	999
	What, is Lavinia then become so loose,	999
	Or Bassianus so degenerate,	999
	That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd	999
	Without controlment, justice, or revenge?	999
	Young lords, beware! and should the empress know	999
	This discord's ground, the music would not please.	999
	999
CHIRON	I care not, I, knew she and all the world:	999
	I love Lavinia more than all the world.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:	999
	Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.	999
	999
AARON	Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome	999
	How furious and impatient they be,	999
	And cannot brook competitors in love?	999
	I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths	999
	By this device.	999
	999
CHIRON	                  Aaron, a thousand deaths	999
	Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.	999
	999
AARON	To achieve her! how?	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Why makest thou it so strange?	999
	She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;	999
	She is a woman, therefore may be won;	999
	She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.	999
	What, man! more water glideth by the mill	999
	Than wots the miller of; and easy it is	999
	Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:	999
	Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.	999
	Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.	999
	999
AARON	[Aside]  Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Then why should he despair that knows to court it	999
	With words, fair looks and liberality?	999
	What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,	999
	And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?	999
	999
AARON	Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so	999
	Would serve your turns.	999
	999
CHIRON	Ay, so the turn were served.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Aaron, thou hast hit it.	999
	999
AARON	Would you had hit it too!	999
	Then should not we be tired with this ado.	999
	Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools	999
	To square for this? would it offend you, then	999
	That both should speed?	999
	999
CHIRON	Faith, not me.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	                  Nor me, so I were one.	999
	999
AARON	For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:	999
	'Tis policy and stratagem must do	999
	That you affect; and so must you resolve,	999
	That what you cannot as you would achieve,	999
	You must perforce accomplish as you may.	999
	Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste	999
	Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.	999
	A speedier course than lingering languishment	999
	Must we pursue, and I have found the path.	999
	My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;	999
	There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:	999
	The forest walks are wide and spacious;	999
	And many unfrequented plots there are	999
	Fitted by kind for rape and villany:	999
	Single you thither then this dainty doe,	999
	And strike her home by force, if not by words:	999
	This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.	999
	Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit	999
	To villany and vengeance consecrate,	999
	Will we acquaint with all that we intend;	999
	And she shall file our engines with advice,	999
	That will not suffer you to square yourselves,	999
	But to your wishes' height advance you both.	999
	The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,	999
	The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:	999
	The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;	999
	There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take	999
	your turns;	999
	There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,	999
	And revel in Lavinia's treasury.	999
	999
CHIRON	Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream	999
	To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.	999
	Per Styga, per manes vehor.	999

SCENE II	A forest near Rome. Horns and cry of hounds heard.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter TITUS ANDRONICUS, with Hunters, &c., MARCUS,	999
	LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,	999
	The fields are fragrant and the woods are green:	999
	Uncouple here and let us make a bay	999
	And wake the emperor and his lovely bride	999
	And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,	999
	That all the court may echo with the noise.	999
	Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,	999
	To attend the emperor's person carefully:	999
	I have been troubled in my sleep this night,	999
	But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.	999
	999
	[A cry of hounds and horns, winded in a peal. Enter	999
	SATURNINUS, TAMORA, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, DEMETRIUS,	999
	CHIRON, and Attendants]	999
	999
	Many good morrows to your majesty;	999
	Madam, to you as many and as good:	999
	I promised your grace a hunter's peal.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	And you have rung it lustily, my lord;	999
	Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.	999
	999
BASSIANUS	Lavinia, how say you?	999
	999
LAVINIA	I say, no;	999
	I have been broad awake two hours and more.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Come on, then; horse and chariots let us have,	999
	And to our sport.	999
	999
	[To TAMORA]	999
	999
	Madam, now shall ye see	999
	Our Roman hunting.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	                  I have dogs, my lord,	999
	Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,	999
	And climb the highest promontory top.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	And I have horse will follow where the game	999
	Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,	999
	But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.	999

SCENE III	A lonely part of the forest.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter AARON, with a bag of gold]	999
	999
AARON	He that had wit would think that I had none,	999
	To bury so much gold under a tree,	999
	And never after to inherit it.	999
	Let him that thinks of me so abjectly	999
	Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,	999
	Which, cunningly effected, will beget	999
	A very excellent piece of villany:	999
	And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest	999
	999
	[Hides the gold]	999
	999
	That have their alms out of the empress' chest.	999
	999
	[Enter TAMORA]	999
	999
TAMORA	My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,	999
	When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?	999
	The birds chant melody on every bush,	999
	The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,	999
	The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind	999
	And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:	999
	Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,	999
	And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,	999
	Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,	999
	As if a double hunt were heard at once,	999
	Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;	999
	And, after conflict such as was supposed	999
	The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,	999
	When with a happy storm they were surprised	999
	And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,	999
	We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,	999
	Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;	999
	Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds	999
	Be unto us as is a nurse's song	999
	Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.	999
	999
AARON	Madam, though Venus govern your desires,	999
	Saturn is dominator over mine:	999
	What signifies my deadly-standing eye,	999
	My silence and my cloudy melancholy,	999
	My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls	999
	Even as an adder when she doth unroll	999
	To do some fatal execution?	999
	No, madam, these are no venereal signs:	999
	Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,	999
	Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.	999
	Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,	999
	Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,	999
	This is the day of doom for Bassianus:	999
	His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,	999
	Thy sons make pillage of her chastity	999
	And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.	999
	Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,	999
	And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.	999
	Now question me no more; we are espied;	999
	Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,	999
	Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.	999
	999
TAMORA	Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!	999
	999
AARON	No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:	999
	Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons	999
	To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA]	999
	999
BASSIANUS	Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,	999
	Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?	999
	Or is it Dian, habited like her,	999
	Who hath abandoned her holy groves	999
	To see the general hunting in this forest?	999
	999
TAMORA	Saucy controller of our private steps!	999
	Had I the power that some say Dian had,	999
	Thy temples should be planted presently	999
	With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds	999
	Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,	999
	Unmannerly intruder as thou art!	999
	999
LAVINIA	Under your patience, gentle empress,	999
	'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;	999
	And to be doubted that your Moor and you	999
	Are singled forth to try experiments:	999
	Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!	999
	'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.	999
	999
BASSIANUS	Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian	999
	Doth make your honour of his body's hue,	999
	Spotted, detested, and abominable.	999
	Why are you sequester'd from all your train,	999
	Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.	999
	And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,	999
	Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,	999
	If foul desire had not conducted you?	999
	999
LAVINIA	And, being intercepted in your sport,	999
	Great reason that my noble lord be rated	999
	For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,	999
	And let her joy her raven-colour'd love;	999
	This valley fits the purpose passing well.	999
	999
BASSIANUS	The king my brother shall have note of this.	999
	999
LAVINIA	Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:	999
	Good king, to be so mightily abused!	999
	999
TAMORA	Why have I patience to endure all this?	999
	999
	[Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON]	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!	999
	Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?	999
	999
TAMORA	Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?	999
	These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:	999
	A barren detested vale, you see it is;	999
	The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,	999
	O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:	999
	Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,	999
	Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:	999
	And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,	999
	They told me, here, at dead time of the night,	999
	A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,	999
	Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,	999
	Would make such fearful and confused cries	999
	As any mortal body hearing it	999
	Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.	999
	No sooner had they told this hellish tale,	999
	But straight they told me they would bind me here	999
	Unto the body of a dismal yew,	999
	And leave me to this miserable death:	999
	And then they call'd me foul adulteress,	999
	Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms	999
	That ever ear did hear to such effect:	999
	And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,	999
	This vengeance on me had they executed.	999
	Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,	999
	Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	This is a witness that I am thy son.	999
	999
	[Stabs BASSIANUS]	999
	999
CHIRON	And this for me, struck home to show my strength.	999
	999
	[Also stabs BASSIANUS, who dies]	999
	999
LAVINIA	Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,	999
	For no name fits thy nature but thy own!	999
	999
TAMORA	Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys	999
	Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;	999
	First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:	999
	This minion stood upon her chastity,	999
	Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,	999
	And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:	999
	And shall she carry this unto her grave?	999
	999
CHIRON	An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.	999
	Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,	999
	And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.	999
	999
TAMORA	But when ye have the honey ye desire,	999
	Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.	999
	999
CHIRON	I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.	999
	Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy	999
	That nice-preserved honesty of yours.	999
	999
LAVINIA	O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,--	999
	999
TAMORA	I will not hear her speak; away with her!	999
	999
LAVINIA	Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory	999
	To see her tears; but be your heart to them	999
	As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.	999
	999
LAVINIA	When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?	999
	O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;	999
	The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;	999
	Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.	999
	Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:	999
	999
	[To CHIRON]	999
	999
	Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.	999
	999
CHIRON	What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?	999
	999
LAVINIA	'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:	999
	Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--	999
	The lion moved with pity did endure	999
	To have his princely paws pared all away:	999
	Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,	999
	The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:	999
	O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,	999
	Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!	999
	999
TAMORA	I know not what it means; away with her!	999
	999
LAVINIA	O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,	999
	That gave thee life, when well he might have	999
	slain thee,	999
	Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.	999
	999
TAMORA	Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,	999
	Even for his sake am I pitiless.	999
	Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,	999
	To save your brother from the sacrifice;	999
	But fierce Andronicus would not relent;	999
	Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,	999
	The worse to her, the better loved of me.	999
	999
LAVINIA	O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,	999
	And with thine own hands kill me in this place!	999
	For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;	999
	Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.	999
	999
TAMORA	What begg'st thou, then? fond woman, let me go.	999
	999
LAVINIA	'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more	999
	That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:	999
	O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,	999
	And tumble me into some loathsome pit,	999
	Where never man's eye may behold my body:	999
	Do this, and be a charitable murderer.	999
	999
TAMORA	So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:	999
	No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.	999
	999
LAVINIA	No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature!	999
	The blot and enemy to our general name!	999
	Confusion fall--	999
	999
CHIRON	Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:	999
	This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.	999
	999
	[DEMETRIUS throws the body of BASSIANUS into the	999
	pit; then exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, dragging	999
	off LAVINIA]	999
	999
TAMORA	Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure.	999
	Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,	999
	Till all the Andronici be made away.	999
	Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,	999
	And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Re-enter AARON, with QUINTUS and MARTIUS]	999
	999
AARON	Come on, my lords, the better foot before:	999
	Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit	999
	Where I espied the panther fast asleep.	999
	999
QUINTUS	My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.	999
	999
MARTIUS	And mine, I promise you; were't not for shame,	999
	Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.	999
	999
	[Falls into the pit]	999
	999
QUINTUS	What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,	999
	Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,	999
	Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood	999
	As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?	999
	A very fatal place it seems to me.	999
	999
	Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?	999
	999
MARTIUS	O brother, with the dismall'st object hurt	999
	That ever eye with sight made heart lament!	999
	999
AARON	[Aside]  Now will I fetch the king to find them here,	999
	That he thereby may give a likely guess	999
	How these were they that made away his brother.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
MARTIUS	Why dost not comfort me, and help me out	999
	From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?	999
	999
QUINTUS	I am surprised with an uncouth fear;	999
	A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints:	999
	My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.	999
	999
MARTIUS	To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,	999
	Aaron and thou look down into this den,	999
	And see a fearful sight of blood and death.	999
	999
QUINTUS	Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart	999
	Will not permit mine eyes once to behold	999
	The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;	999
	O, tell me how it is; for ne'er till now	999
	Was I a child to fear I know not what.	999
	999
MARTIUS	Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,	999
	All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,	999
	In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.	999
	999
QUINTUS	If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?	999
	999
MARTIUS	Upon his bloody finger he doth wear	999
	A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,	999
	Which, like a taper in some monument,	999
	Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,	999
	And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:	999
	So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus	999
	When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.	999
	O brother, help me with thy fainting hand--	999
	If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath--	999
	Out of this fell devouring receptacle,	999
	As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.	999
	999
QUINTUS	Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;	999
	Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,	999
	I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb	999
	Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.	999
	I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.	999
	999
MARTIUS	Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.	999
	999
QUINTUS	Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,	999
	Till thou art here aloft, or I below:	999
	Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.	999
	999
	[Falls in]	999
	999
	[Enter SATURNINUS with AARON]	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Along with me: I'll see what hole is here,	999
	And what he is that now is leap'd into it.	999
	Say who art thou that lately didst descend	999
	Into this gaping hollow of the earth?	999
	999
MARTIUS	The unhappy son of old Andronicus:	999
	Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,	999
	To find thy brother Bassianus dead.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:	999
	He and his lady both are at the lodge	999
	Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;	999
	'Tis not an hour since I left him there.	999
	999
MARTIUS	We know not where you left him all alive;	999
	But, out, alas! here have we found him dead.	999
	999
	[Re-enter TAMORA, with Attendants; TITUS	999
	ANDRONICUS, and Lucius]	999
	999
TAMORA	Where is my lord the king?	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief.	999
	999
TAMORA	Where is thy brother Bassianus?	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:	999
	Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.	999
	999
TAMORA	Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,	999
	The complot of this timeless tragedy;	999
	And wonder greatly that man's face can fold	999
	In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.	999
	999
	[She giveth SATURNINUS a letter]	999
	999
SATURNINUS	[Reads]  'An if we miss to meet him handsomely--	999
	Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean--	999
	Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:	999
	Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward	999
	Among the nettles at the elder-tree	999
	Which overshades the mouth of that same pit	999
	Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.	999
	Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'	999
	O Tamora! was ever heard the like?	999
	This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.	999
	Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out	999
	That should have murdered Bassianus here.	999
	999
AARON	My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	[To TITUS]  Two of thy whelps, fell curs of	999
	bloody kind,	999
	Have here bereft my brother of his life.	999
	Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison:	999
	There let them bide until we have devised	999
	Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.	999
	999
TAMORA	What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!	999
	How easily murder is discovered!	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	High emperor, upon my feeble knee	999
	I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,	999
	That this fell fault of my accursed sons,	999
	Accursed if the fault be proved in them,--	999
	999
SATURNINUS	If it be proved! you see it is apparent.	999
	Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?	999
	999
TAMORA	Andronicus himself did take it up.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;	999
	For, by my father's reverend tomb, I vow	999
	They shall be ready at your highness' will	999
	To answer their suspicion with their lives.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.	999
	Some bring the murder'd body, some the murderers:	999
	Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;	999
	For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,	999
	That end upon them should be executed.	999
	999
TAMORA	Andronicus, I will entreat the king;	999
	Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, Lucius, come; stay not to talk with them.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON with LAVINIA, ravished;	999
	her hands cut off, and her tongue cut out]	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	So, now go tell, an if thy tongue can speak,	999
	Who 'twas that cut thy tongue and ravish'd thee.	999
	999
CHIRON	Write down thy mind, bewray thy meaning so,	999
	An if thy stumps will let thee play the scribe.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	See, how with signs and tokens she can scrowl.	999
	999
CHIRON	Go home, call for sweet water, wash thy hands.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	She hath no tongue to call, nor hands to wash;	999
	And so let's leave her to her silent walks.	999
	999
CHIRON	An 'twere my case, I should go hang myself.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	If thou hadst hands to help thee knit the cord.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON]	999
	999
	[Enter MARCUS]	999
	999
MARCUS	Who is this? my niece, that flies away so fast!	999
	Cousin, a word; where is your husband?	999
	If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!	999
	If I do wake, some planet strike me down,	999
	That I may slumber in eternal sleep!	999
	Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands	999
	Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare	999
	Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,	999
	Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,	999
	And might not gain so great a happiness	999
	As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?	999
	Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,	999
	Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,	999
	Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,	999
	Coming and going with thy honey breath.	999
	But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,	999
	And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.	999
	Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!	999
	And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,	999
	As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,	999
	Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face	999
	Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.	999
	Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?	999
	O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,	999
	That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!	999
	Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,	999
	Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.	999
	Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,	999
	And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:	999
	But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;	999
	A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,	999
	And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,	999
	That could have better sew'd than Philomel.	999
	O, had the monster seen those lily hands	999
	Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,	999
	And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,	999
	He would not then have touch'd them for his life!	999
	Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony	999
	Which that sweet tongue hath made,	999
	He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep	999
	As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.	999
	Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;	999
	For such a sight will blind a father's eye:	999
	One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;	999
	What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?	999
	Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee	999
	O, could our mourning ease thy misery!	999

ACT III	999

	999
SCENE I	Rome. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Judges, Senators and Tribunes, with MARTIUS	999
	and QUINTUS, bound, passing on to the place of	999
	execution; TITUS going before, pleading]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!	999
	For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent	999
	In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;	999
	For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;	999
	For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;	999
	And for these bitter tears, which now you see	999
	Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;	999
	Be pitiful to my condemned sons,	999
	Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.	999
	For two and twenty sons I never wept,	999
	Because they died in honour's lofty bed.	999
	999
	[Lieth down; the Judges, &c., pass by him, and Exeunt]	999
	999
	For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write	999
	My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:	999
	Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;	999
	My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.	999
	O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,	999
	That shall distil from these two ancient urns,	999
	Than youthful April shall with all his showers:	999
	In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;	999
	In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow	999
	And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,	999
	So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.	999
	999
	[Enter LUCIUS, with his sword drawn]	999
	999
	O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!	999
	Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;	999
	And let me say, that never wept before,	999
	My tears are now prevailing orators.	999
	999
LUCIUS	O noble father, you lament in vain:	999
	The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;	999
	And you recount your sorrows to a stone.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.	999
	Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,--	999
	999
LUCIUS	My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,	999
	They would not mark me, or if they did mark,	999
	They would not pity me, yet plead I must;	999
	And bootless unto them [                  ]	999
	Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;	999
	Who, though they cannot answer my distress,	999
	Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,	999
	For that they will not intercept my tale:	999
	When I do weep, they humbly at my feet	999
	Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;	999
	And, were they but attired in grave weeds,	999
	Rome could afford no tribune like to these.	999
	A stone is soft as wax,--tribunes more hard than stones;	999
	A stone is silent, and offendeth not,	999
	And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.	999
	999
	[Rises]	999
	999
	But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?	999
	999
LUCIUS	To rescue my two brothers from their death:	999
	For which attempt the judges have pronounced	999
	My everlasting doom of banishment.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	O happy man! they have befriended thee.	999
	Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive	999
	That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?	999
	Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey	999
	But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,	999
	From these devourers to be banished!	999
	But who comes with our brother Marcus here?	999
	999
	[Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA]	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;	999
	Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:	999
	I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Will it consume me? let me see it, then.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	This was thy daughter.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, Marcus, so she is.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Ay me, this object kills me!	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.	999
	Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand	999
	Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?	999
	What fool hath added water to the sea,	999
	Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?	999
	My grief was at the height before thou camest,	999
	And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.	999
	Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;	999
	For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;	999
	And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;	999
	In bootless prayer have they been held up,	999
	And they have served me to effectless use:	999
	Now all the service I require of them	999
	Is that the one will help to cut the other.	999
	'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;	999
	For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O, that delightful engine of her thoughts	999
	That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,	999
	Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,	999
	Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung	999
	Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!	999
	999
LUCIUS	O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O, thus I found her, straying in the park,	999
	Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer	999
	That hath received some unrecuring wound.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	It was my deer; and he that wounded her	999
	Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:	999
	For now I stand as one upon a rock	999
	Environed with a wilderness of sea,	999
	Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,	999
	Expecting ever when some envious surge	999
	Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.	999
	This way to death my wretched sons are gone;	999
	Here stands my other son, a banished man,	999
	And here my brother, weeping at my woes.	999
	But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,	999
	Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.	999
	Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,	999
	It would have madded me: what shall I do	999
	Now I behold thy lively body so?	999
	Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:	999
	Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:	999
	Thy husband he is dead: and for his death	999
	Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.	999
	Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!	999
	When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears	999
	Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew	999
	Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;	999
	Perchance because she knows them innocent.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful	999
	Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.	999
	No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;	999
	Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.	999
	Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.	999
	Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:	999
	Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,	999
	And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,	999
	Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks	999
	How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,	999
	With miry slime left on them by a flood?	999
	And in the fountain shall we gaze so long	999
	Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,	999
	And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?	999
	Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?	999
	Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows	999
	Pass the remainder of our hateful days?	999
	What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,	999
	Plot some deuce of further misery,	999
	To make us wonder'd at in time to come.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,	999
	See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot	999
	Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,	999
	For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:	999
	Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say	999
	That to her brother which I said to thee:	999
	His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,	999
	Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.	999
	O, what a sympathy of woe is this,	999
	As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!	999
	999
	[Enter AARON]	999
	999
AARON	Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor	999
	Sends thee this word,--that, if thou love thy sons,	999
	Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,	999
	Or any one of you, chop off your hand,	999
	And send it to the king: he for the same	999
	Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;	999
	And that shall be the ransom for their fault.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!	999
	Did ever raven sing so like a lark,	999
	That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?	999
	With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand:	999
	Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?	999
	999
LUCIUS	Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,	999
	That hath thrown down so many enemies,	999
	Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:	999
	My youth can better spare my blood than you;	999
	And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	 Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,	999
	And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,	999
	Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?	999
	O, none of both but are of high desert:	999
	My hand hath been but idle; let it serve	999
	To ransom my two nephews from their death;	999
	Then have I kept it to a worthy end.	999
	999
AARON	Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,	999
	For fear they die before their pardon come.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	My hand shall go.	999
	999
LUCIUS	                  By heaven, it shall not go!	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these	999
	Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,	999
	Let me redeem my brothers both from death.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	And, for our father's sake and mother's care,	999
	Now let me show a brother's love to thee.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Agree between you; I will spare my hand.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Then I'll go fetch an axe.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	But I will use the axe.	999
	999
	[Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both:	999
	Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.	999
	999
AARON	[Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,	999
	And never, whilst I live, deceive men so:	999
	But I'll deceive you in another sort,	999
	And that you'll say, ere half an hour pass.	999
	999
	[Cuts off TITUS's hand]	999
	999
	[Re-enter LUCIUS and MARCUS]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatch'd.	999
	Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:	999
	Tell him it was a hand that warded him	999
	From thousand dangers; bid him bury it	999
	More hath it merited; that let it have.	999
	As for my sons, say I account of them	999
	As jewels purchased at an easy price;	999
	And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.	999
	999
AARON	I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand	999
	Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	Their heads, I mean. O, how this villany	999
	Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!	999
	Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.	999
	Aaron will have his soul black like his face.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,	999
	And bow this feeble ruin to the earth:	999
	If any power pities wretched tears,	999
	To that I call!	999
	999
	[To LAVINIA]	999
	What, wilt thou kneel with me?	999
	Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers;	999
	Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim,	999
	And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds	999
	When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O brother, speak with possibilities,	999
	And do not break into these deep extremes.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?	999
	Then be my passions bottomless with them.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	But yet let reason govern thy lament.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	If there were reason for these miseries,	999
	Then into limits could I bind my woes:	999
	When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?	999
	If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,	999
	Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?	999
	And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?	999
	I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow!	999
	She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:	999
	Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;	999
	Then must my earth with her continual tears	999
	Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;	999
	For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,	999
	But like a drunkard must I vomit them.	999
	Then give me leave, for losers will have leave	999
	To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger, with two heads and a hand]	999
	999
Messenger	Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid	999
	For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor.	999
	Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;	999
	And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back;	999
	Thy griefs their sports, thy resolution mock'd;	999
	That woe is me to think upon thy woes	999
	More than remembrance of my father's death.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily,	999
	And be my heart an ever-burning hell!	999
	These miseries are more than may be borne.	999
	To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal;	999
	But sorrow flouted at is double death.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,	999
	And yet detested life not shrink thereat!	999
	That ever death should let life bear his name,	999
	Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!	999
	999
	[LAVINIA kisses TITUS]	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless	999
	As frozen water to a starved snake.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	When will this fearful slumber have an end?	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Now, farewell, flattery: die, Andronicus;	999
	Thou dost not slumber: see, thy two sons' heads,	999
	Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here:	999
	Thy other banish'd son, with this dear sight	999
	Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,	999
	Even like a stony image, cold and numb.	999
	Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs:	999
	Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand	999
	Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight	999
	The closing up of our most wretched eyes;	999
	Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Ha, ha, ha!	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this hour.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, I have not another tear to shed:	999
	Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,	999
	And would usurp upon my watery eyes	999
	And make them blind with tributary tears:	999
	Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?	999
	For these two heads do seem to speak to me,	999
	And threat me I shall never come to bliss	999
	Till all these mischiefs be return'd again	999
	Even in their throats that have committed them.	999
	Come, let me see what task I have to do.	999
	You heavy people, circle me about,	999
	That I may turn me to each one of you,	999
	And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.	999
	The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;	999
	And in this hand the other I will bear.	999
	Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!	999
	Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.	999
	As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;	999
	Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:	999
	Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:	999
	And, if you love me, as I think you do,	999
	Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.	999
	999
	[Exeunt TITUS, MARCUS, and LAVINIA]	999
	999
LUCIUS	Farewell Andronicus, my noble father,	999
	The wofull'st man that ever lived in Rome:	999
	Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,	999
	He leaves his pledges dearer than his life:	999
	Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;	999
	O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!	999
	But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives	999
	But in oblivion and hateful griefs.	999
	If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs;	999
	And make proud Saturnine and his empress	999
	Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen.	999
	Now will I to the Goths, and raise a power,	999
	To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.	999

SCENE II	A room in Titus's house. A banquet set out.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter TITUS, MARCUS, LAVINIA and Young LUCIUS, a boy]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more	999
	Than will preserve just so much strength in us	999
	As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.	999
	Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:	999
	Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,	999
	And cannot passionate our tenfold grief	999
	With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine	999
	Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;	999
	Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,	999
	Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,	999
	Then thus I thump it down.	999
	999
	[To LAVINIA]	999
	999
	Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!	999
	When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,	999
	Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.	999
	Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;	999
	Or get some little knife between thy teeth,	999
	And just against thy heart make thou a hole;	999
	That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall	999
	May run into that sink, and soaking in	999
	Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Fie, brother, fie! teach her not thus to lay	999
	Such violent hands upon her tender life.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?	999
	Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.	999
	What violent hands can she lay on her life?	999
	Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;	999
	To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er,	999
	How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?	999
	O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,	999
	Lest we remember still that we have none.	999
	Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,	999
	As if we should forget we had no hands,	999
	If Marcus did not name the word of hands!	999
	Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:	999
	Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;	999
	I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;	999
	She says she drinks no other drink but tears,	999
	Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks:	999
	Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;	999
	In thy dumb action will I be as perfect	999
	As begging hermits in their holy prayers:	999
	Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,	999
	Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,	999
	But I of these will wrest an alphabet	999
	And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.	999
	999
Young LUCIUS	Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments:	999
	Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,	999
	Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,	999
	And tears will quickly melt thy life away.	999
	999
	[MARCUS strikes the dish with a knife]	999
	999
	What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	At that that I have kill'd, my lord; a fly.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Out on thee, murderer! thou kill'st my heart;	999
	Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny:	999
	A deed of death done on the innocent	999
	Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone:	999
	I see thou art not for my company.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	But how, if that fly had a father and mother?	999
	How would he hang his slender gilded wings,	999
	And buzz lamenting doings in the air!	999
	Poor harmless fly,	999
	That, with his pretty buzzing melody,	999
	Came here to make us merry! and thou hast	999
	kill'd him.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favor'd fly,	999
	Like to the empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	O, O, O,	999
	Then pardon me for reprehending thee,	999
	For thou hast done a charitable deed.	999
	Give me thy knife, I will insult on him;	999
	Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor	999
	Come hither purposely to poison me.--	999
	There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.	999
	Ah, sirrah!	999
	Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,	999
	But that between us we can kill a fly	999
	That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,	999
	He takes false shadows for true substances.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:	999
	I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee	999
	Sad stories chanced in the times of old.	999
	Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,	999
	And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Rome. Titus's garden.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter young LUCIUS, and LAVINIA running after him,	999
	and the boy flies from her, with books under his	999
	arm. Then enter TITUS and MARCUS]	999
	999
Young LUCIUS	Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia	999
	Follows me every where, I know not why:	999
	Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.	999
	Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.	999
	999
Young LUCIUS	Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:	999
	See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:	999
	Somewhither would she have thee go with her.	999
	Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care	999
	Read to her sons than she hath read to thee	999
	Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?	999
	999
Young LUCIUS	My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,	999
	Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:	999
	For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,	999
	Extremity of griefs would make men mad;	999
	And I have read that Hecuba of Troy	999
	Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;	999
	Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt	999
	Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,	999
	And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:	999
	Which made me down to throw my books, and fly--	999
	Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:	999
	And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,	999
	I will most willingly attend your ladyship.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Lucius, I will.	999
	999
	[LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which	999
	LUCIUS has let fall]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?	999
	Some book there is that she desires to see.	999
	Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.	999
	But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd	999
	Come, and take choice of all my library,	999
	And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens	999
	Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.	999
	Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	I think she means that there was more than one	999
	Confederate in the fact: ay, more there was;	999
	Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?	999
	999
Young LUCIUS	Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;	999
	My mother gave it me.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	For love of her that's gone,	999
	Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!	999
	999
	[Helping her]	999
	999
	What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?	999
	This is the tragic tale of Philomel,	999
	And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:	999
	And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,	999
	Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,	999
	Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!	999
	Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--	999
	O, had we never, never hunted there!--	999
	Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,	999
	By nature made for murders and for rapes.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O, why should nature build so foul a den,	999
	Unless the gods delight in tragedies?	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none	999
	but friends,	999
	What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:	999
	Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,	999
	That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.	999
	Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,	999
	Inspire me, that I may this treason find!	999
	My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:	999
	This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst	999
	This after me, when I have writ my name	999
	Without the help of any hand at all.	999
	999
	[He writes his name with his staff, and guides it	999
	with feet and mouth]	999
	999
	Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!	999
	Write thou good niece; and here display, at last,	999
	What God will have discover'd for revenge;	999
	Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,	999
	That we may know the traitors and the truth!	999
	999
	[She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it	999
	with her stumps, and writes]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?	999
	'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora	999
	Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Magni Dominator poli,	999
	Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know	999
	There is enough written upon this earth	999
	To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts	999
	And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.	999
	My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;	999
	And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;	999
	And swear with me, as, with the woful fere	999
	And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,	999
	Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,	999
	That we will prosecute by good advice	999
	Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,	999
	And see their blood, or die with this reproach.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	'Tis sure enough, an you knew how.	999
	But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:	999
	The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once,	999
	She's with the lion deeply still in league,	999
	And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,	999
	And when he sleeps will she do what she list.	999
	You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;	999
	And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,	999
	And with a gad of steel will write these words,	999
	And lay it by: the angry northern wind	999
	Will blow these sands, like Sibyl's leaves, abroad,	999
	And where's your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?	999
	999
Young LUCIUS	I say, my lord, that if I were a man,	999
	Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe	999
	For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Ay, that's my boy! thy father hath full oft	999
	For his ungrateful country done the like.	999
	999
Young LUCIUS	And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, go with me into mine armoury;	999
	Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,	999
	Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons	999
	Presents that I intend to send them both:	999
	Come, come; thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?	999
	999
Young LUCIUS	Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.	999
	Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:	999
	Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:	999
	Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on.	999
	999
	[Exeunt TITUS, LAVINIA, and Young LUCIUS]	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,	999
	And not relent, or not compassion him?	999
	Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,	999
	That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart	999
	Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield;	999
	But yet so just that he will not revenge.	999
	Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!	999

	999
CHIRON	Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;	999

AARON	Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.	999

	I greet your honours from Andronicus.	999
	999

Young LUCIUS	[Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,	999

	And so I do, and with his gifts present	999

	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,	999
	Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu.'	999
	999
CHIRON	O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:	999
	I read it in the grammar long ago.	999
	999
AARON	Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!	999
	Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;	999
	And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,	999
	That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.	999
	But were our witty empress well afoot,	999
	She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:	999
	But let her rest in her unrest awhile.	999
	999
	And now, young lords, was't not a happy star	999
	Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,	999
	Captives, to be advanced to this height?	999
	It did me good, before the palace gate	999
	To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	But me more good, to see so great a lord	999
	Basely insinuate and send us gifts.	999
	999
AARON	Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?	999
	Did you not use his daughter very friendly?	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	I would we had a thousand Roman dames	999
	At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.	999
	999
CHIRON	A charitable wish and full of love.	999
	999
AARON	Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.	999
	999
CHIRON	And that would she for twenty thousand more.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Come, let us go; and pray to all the gods	999
	For our beloved mother in her pains.	999
	999
AARON	[Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.	999
	999
	[Trumpets sound within]	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?	999
	999
CHIRON	Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Soft! who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter a Nurse, with a blackamoor Child in her arms]	999
	999
Nurse	Good morrow, lords:	999
	O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?	999
	999
AARON	Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,	999
	Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?	999
	999
Nurse	O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!	999
	Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!	999
	999
AARON	Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!	999
	What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?	999
	999
Nurse	O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,	999
	Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!	999
	She is deliver'd, lords; she is deliver'd.	999
	999
AARON	To whom?	999
	999
Nurse	       I mean, she is brought a-bed.	999
	999
AARON	Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?	999
	999
Nurse	A devil.	999
	999
AARON	Why, then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue.	999
	999
Nurse	A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue:	999
	Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad	999
	Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:	999
	The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,	999
	And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.	999
	999
AARON	'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?	999
	Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Villain, what hast thou done?	999
	999
AARON	That which thou canst not undo.	999
	999
CHIRON	Thou hast undone our mother.	999
	999
AARON	Villain, I have done thy mother.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.	999
	Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!	999
	Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!	999
	999
CHIRON	It shall not live.	999
	999
AARON	It shall not die.	999
	999
Nurse	Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.	999
	999
AARON	What, must it, nurse? then let no man but I	999
	Do execution on my flesh and blood.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:	999
	Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.	999
	999
AARON	Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.	999
	999
	[Takes the Child from the Nurse, and draws]	999
	999
	Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?	999
	Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,	999
	That shone so brightly when this boy was got,	999
	He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point	999
	That touches this my first-born son and heir!	999
	I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,	999
	With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,	999
	Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,	999
	Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.	999
	What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!	999
	Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!	999
	Coal-black is better than another hue,	999
	In that it scorns to bear another hue;	999
	For all the water in the ocean	999
	Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,	999
	Although she lave them hourly in the flood.	999
	Tell the empress from me, I am of age	999
	To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?	999
	999
AARON	My mistress is my mistress; this myself,	999
	The vigour and the picture of my youth:	999
	This before all the world do I prefer;	999
	This maugre all the world will I keep safe,	999
	Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	By this our mother is forever shamed.	999
	999
CHIRON	Rome will despise her for this foul escape.	999
	999
Nurse	The emperor, in his rage, will doom her death.	999
	999
CHIRON	I blush to think upon this ignomy.	999
	999
AARON	Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:	999
	Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing	999
	The close enacts and counsels of the heart!	999
	Here's a young lad framed of another leer:	999
	Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,	999
	As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'	999
	He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed	999
	Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,	999
	And from that womb where you imprison'd were	999
	He is enfranchised and come to light:	999
	Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,	999
	Although my seal be stamped in his face.	999
	999
Nurse	Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,	999
	And we will all subscribe to thy advice:	999
	Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.	999
	999
AARON	Then sit we down, and let us all consult.	999
	My son and I will have the wind of you:	999
	Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.	999
	999
	[They sit]	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	How many women saw this child of his?	999
	999
AARON	Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league,	999
	I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,	999
	The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,	999
	The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.	999
	But say, again; how many saw the child?	999
	999
Nurse	Cornelia the midwife and myself;	999
	And no one else but the deliver'd empress.	999
	999
AARON	The empress, the midwife, and yourself:	999
	Two may keep counsel when the third's away:	999
	Go to the empress, tell her this I said.	999
	999
	[He kills the nurse]	999
	999
	Weke, weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	What mean'st thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?	999
	999
AARON	O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy:	999
	Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,	999
	A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:	999
	And now be it known to you my full intent.	999
	Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;	999
	His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;	999
	His child is like to her, fair as you are:	999
	Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,	999
	And tell them both the circumstance of all;	999
	And how by this their child shall be advanced,	999
	And be received for the emperor's heir,	999
	And substituted in the place of mine,	999
	To calm this tempest whirling in the court;	999
	And let the emperor dandle him for his own.	999
	Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,	999
	999
	[Pointing to the nurse]	999
	999
	And you must needs bestow her funeral;	999
	The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:	999
	This done, see that you take no longer days,	999
	But send the midwife presently to me.	999
	The midwife and the nurse well made away,	999
	Then let the ladies tattle what they please.	999
	999
CHIRON	Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air	999
	With secrets.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	                  For this care of Tamora,	999
	Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the	999
	Nurse's body]	999
	999
AARON	Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies;	999
	There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,	999
	And secretly to greet the empress' friends.	999
	Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;	999
	For it is you that puts us to our shifts:	999
	I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,	999
	And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,	999
	And cabin in a cave, and bring you up	999
	To be a warrior, and command a camp.	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	The same. A public place.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter TITUS, bearing arrows with letters at the	999
	ends of them; with him, MARCUS, Young LUCIUS,	999
	PUBLIUS, SEMPRONIUS, CAIUS, and other Gentlemen,	999
	with bows]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way.	999
	Sir boy, now let me see your archery;	999
	Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.	999
	Terras Astraea reliquit:	999
	Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled.	999
	Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall	999
	Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;	999
	Happily you may catch her in the sea;	999
	Yet there's as little justice as at land:	999
	No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;	999
	'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,	999
	And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:	999
	Then, when you come to Pluto's region,	999
	I pray you, deliver him this petition;	999
	Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,	999
	And that it comes from old Andronicus,	999
	Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.	999
	Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable	999
	What time I threw the people's suffrages	999
	On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.	999
	Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,	999
	And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:	999
	This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;	999
	And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O Publius, is not this a heavy case,	999
	To see thy noble uncle thus distract?	999
	999
PUBLIUS	Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns	999
	By day and night to attend him carefully,	999
	And feed his humour kindly as we may,	999
	Till time beget some careful remedy.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.	999
	Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war	999
	Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,	999
	And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Publius, how now! how now, my masters!	999
	What, have you met with her?	999
	999
PUBLIUS	No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,	999
	If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall:	999
	Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,	999
	He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,	999
	So that perforce you must needs stay a time.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.	999
	I'll dive into the burning lake below,	999
	And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.	999
	Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we	999
	No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;	999
	But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,	999
	Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:	999
	And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,	999
	We will solicit heaven and move the gods	999
	To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.	999
	Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus;	999
	999
	[He gives them the arrows]	999
	999
	'Ad Jovem,' that's for you: here, 'Ad Apollinem:'	999
	'Ad Martem,' that's for myself:	999
	Here, boy, to Pallas: here, to Mercury:	999
	To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine;	999
	You were as good to shoot against the wind.	999
	To it, boy! Marcus, loose when I bid.	999
	Of my word, I have written to effect;	999
	There's not a god left unsolicited.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:	999
	We will afflict the emperor in his pride.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Now, masters, draw.	999
	999
	[They shoot]	999
		O, well said, Lucius!	999
	Good boy, in Virgo's lap; give it Pallas.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;	999
	Your letter is with Jupiter by this.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Ha, ha!	999
	Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?	999
	See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,	999
	The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock	999
	That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;	999
	And who should find them but the empress' villain?	999
	She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose	999
	But give them to his master for a present.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy!	999
	999
	[Enter a Clown, with a basket, and two pigeons in	999
	it]	999
	999
	News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come.	999
	Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?	999
	Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?	999
	999
Clown	O, the gibbet-maker! he says that he hath taken	999
	them down again, for the man must not be hanged till	999
	the next week.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?	999
	999
Clown	Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him	999
	in all my life.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?	999
	999
Clown	Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, didst thou not come from heaven?	999
	999
Clown	From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there     God	999
	forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my	999
	young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the	999
	tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl	999
	betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for	999
	your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to	999
	the emperor from you.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor	999
	with a grace?	999
	999
Clown	Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,	999
	But give your pigeons to the emperor:	999
	By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.	999
	Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money for thy charges.	999
	Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace	999
	deliver a supplication?	999
	999
Clown	Ay, sir.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Then here is a supplication for you. And when you	999
	come to him, at the first approach you must kneel,	999
	then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and	999
	then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see	999
	you do it bravely.	999
	999
Clown	I warrant you, sir, let me alone.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Sirrah, hast thou a knife? come, let me see it.	999
	Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;	999
	For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.	999
	And when thou hast given it the emperor,	999
	Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.	999
	999
Clown	God be with you, sir; I will.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.	999

SCENE IV	The same. Before the palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON,	999
	Lords, and others; SATURNINUS with the arrows in	999
	his hand that TITUS shot]	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen	999
	An emperor in Rome thus overborne,	999
	Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent	999
	Of egal justice, used in such contempt?	999
	My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,	999
	However these disturbers of our peace	999
	Buz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd,	999
	But even with law, against the willful sons	999
	Of old Andronicus. And what an if	999
	His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,	999
	Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,	999
	His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?	999
	And now he writes to heaven for his redress:	999
	See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;	999
	This to Apollo; this to the god of war;	999
	Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!	999
	What's this but libelling against the senate,	999
	And blazoning our injustice every where?	999
	A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?	999
	As who would say, in Rome no justice were.	999
	But if I live, his feigned ecstasies	999
	Shall be no shelter to these outrages:	999
	But he and his shall know that justice lives	999
	In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,	999
	He'll so awake as she in fury shall	999
	Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.	999
	999
TAMORA	My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,	999
	Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,	999
	Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,	999
	The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,	999
	Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart;	999
	And rather comfort his distressed plight	999
	Than prosecute the meanest or the best	999
	For these contempts.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
		Why, thus it shall become	999
	High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:	999
	But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,	999
	Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,	999
	Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port.	999
	999
	[Enter Clown]	999
	999
	How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?	999
	999
Clown	Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial.	999
	999
TAMORA	Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.	999
	999
Clown	'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:	999
	I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.	999
	999
	[SATURNINUS reads the letter]	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Go, take him away, and hang him presently.	999
	999
Clown	How much money must I have?	999
	999
TAMORA	Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.	999
	999
Clown	Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to	999
	a fair end.	999
	999
	[Exit, guarded]	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!	999
	Shall I endure this monstrous villany?	999
	I know from whence this same device proceeds:	999
	May this be borne?--as if his traitorous sons,	999
	That died by law for murder of our brother,	999
	Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!	999
	Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;	999
	Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:	999
	For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;	999
	Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,	999
	In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.	999
	999
	[Enter AEMILIUS]	999
	999
	What news with thee, AEmilius?	999
	999
AEMILIUS	Arm, arm, my lord;--Rome never had more cause.	999
	The Goths have gather'd head; and with a power	999
	high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,	999
	They hither march amain, under conduct	999
	Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;	999
	Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do	999
	As much as ever Coriolanus did.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?	999
	These tidings nip me, and I hang the head	999
	As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:	999
	Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:	999
	'Tis he the common people love so much;	999
	Myself hath often over-heard them say,	999
	When I have walked like a private man,	999
	That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,	999
	And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.	999
	999
TAMORA	Why should you fear? is not your city strong?	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,	999
	And will revolt from me to succor him.	999
	999
TAMORA	King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.	999
	Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?	999
	The eagle suffers little birds to sing,	999
	And is not careful what they mean thereby,	999
	Knowing that with the shadow of his wings	999
	He can at pleasure stint their melody:	999
	Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.	999
	Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,	999
	I will enchant the old Andronicus	999
	With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,	999
	Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,	999
	When as the one is wounded with the bait,	999
	The other rotted with delicious feed.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	But he will not entreat his son for us.	999
	999
TAMORA	If Tamora entreat him, then he will:	999
	For I can smooth and fill his aged ear	999
	With golden promises; that, were his heart	999
	Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,	999
	Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.	999
	999
	[To AEmilius]	999
	999
	Go thou before, be our ambassador:	999
	Say that the emperor requests a parley	999
	Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting	999
	Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	AEmilius, do this message honourably:	999
	And if he stand on hostage for his safety,	999
	Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.	999
	999
AEMILIUS	Your bidding shall I do effectually.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
TAMORA	Now will I to that old Andronicus;	999
	And temper him with all the art I have,	999
	To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.	999
	And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,	999
	And bury all thy fear in my devices.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Then go successantly, and plead to him.	999

ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Plains near Rome.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths, with drum and colours]	999
	999
LUCIUS	Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,	999
	I have received letters from great Rome,	999
	Which signify what hate they bear their emperor	999
	And how desirous of our sight they are.	999
	Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,	999
	Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,	999
	And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,	999
	Let him make treble satisfaction.	999
	999
First Goth	Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,	999
	Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;	999
	Whose high exploits and honourable deeds	999
	Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,	999
	Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,	999
	Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day	999
	Led by their master to the flowered fields,	999
	And be avenged on cursed Tamora.	999
	999
All the Goths	And as he saith, so say we all with him.	999
	999
LUCIUS	I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.	999
	But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?	999
	999
	[Enter a Goth, leading AARON with his Child in his arms]	999
	999
Second Goth	Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd	999
	To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;	999
	And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye	999
	Upon the wasted building, suddenly	999
	I heard a child cry underneath a wall.	999
	I made unto the noise; when soon I heard	999
	The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:	999
	'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!	999
	Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,	999
	Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,	999
	Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:	999
	But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,	999
	They never do beget a coal-black calf.	999
	Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates	999
	the babe,--	999
	'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;	999
	Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,	999
	Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'	999
	With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,	999
	Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,	999
	To use as you think needful of the man.	999
	999
LUCIUS	O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil	999
	That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;	999
	This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,	999
	And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.	999
	Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey	999
	This growing image of thy fiend-like face?	999
	Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?	999
	A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.	999
	And by his side his fruit of bastardy.	999
	999
AARON	Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Too like the sire for ever being good.	999
	First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;	999
	A sight to vex the father's soul withal.	999
	Get me a ladder.	999
	999
	[A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend]	999
	999
AARON	                  Lucius, save the child,	999
	And bear it from me to the empress.	999
	If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,	999
	That highly may advantage thee to hear:	999
	If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,	999
	I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'	999
	999
LUCIUS	Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st	999
	Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.	999
	999
AARON	An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,	999
	'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;	999
	For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,	999
	Acts of black night, abominable deeds,	999
	Complots of mischief, treason, villanies	999
	Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:	999
	And this shall all be buried by my death,	999
	Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.	999
	999
AARON	Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:	999
	That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?	999
	999
AARON	What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;	999
	Yet, for I know thou art religious	999
	And hast a thing within thee called conscience,	999
	With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,	999
	Which I have seen thee careful to observe,	999
	Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know	999
	An idiot holds his bauble for a god	999
	And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,	999
	To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow	999
	By that same god, what god soe'er it be,	999
	That thou adorest and hast in reverence,	999
	To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;	999
	Or else I will discover nought to thee.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Even by my god I swear to thee I will.	999
	999
AARON	First know thou, I begot him on the empress.	999
	999
LUCIUS	O most insatiate and luxurious woman!	999
	999
AARON	Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity	999
	To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.	999
	'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;	999
	They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her	999
	And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.	999
	999
LUCIUS	O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?	999
	999
AARON	Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas	999
	Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.	999
	999
LUCIUS	O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!	999
	999
AARON	Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:	999
	That codding spirit had they from their mother,	999
	As sure a card as ever won the set;	999
	That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,	999
	As true a dog as ever fought at head.	999
	Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.	999
	I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole	999
	Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:	999
	I wrote the letter that thy father found	999
	And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,	999
	Confederate with the queen and her two sons:	999
	And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,	999
	Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?	999
	I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,	999
	And, when I had it, drew myself apart	999
	And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:	999
	I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall	999
	When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;	999
	Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,	999
	That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :	999
	And when I told the empress of this sport,	999
	She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,	999
	And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.	999
	999
First Goth	What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?	999
	999
AARON	Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?	999
	999
AARON	Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.	999
	Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,	999
	Few come within the compass of my curse,--	999
	Wherein I did not some notorious ill,	999
	As kill a man, or else devise his death,	999
	Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,	999
	Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,	999
	Set deadly enmity between two friends,	999
	Make poor men's cattle break their necks;	999
	Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,	999
	And bid the owners quench them with their tears.	999
	Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,	999
	And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,	999
	Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;	999
	And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,	999
	Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,	999
	'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'	999
	Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things	999
	As willingly as one would kill a fly,	999
	And nothing grieves me heartily indeed	999
	But that I cannot do ten thousand more.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Bring down the devil; for he must not die	999
	So sweet a death as hanging presently.	999
	999
AARON	If there be devils, would I were a devil,	999
	To live and burn in everlasting fire,	999
	So I might have your company in hell,	999
	But to torment you with my bitter tongue!	999
	999
LUCIUS	Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.	999
	999
	[Enter a Goth]	999
	999
Third Goth	My lord, there is a messenger from Rome	999
	Desires to be admitted to your presence.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Let him come near.	999
	999
	[Enter AEMILIUS]	999
	999
	Welcome, AEmilius	what's the news from Rome?	999
	999
AEMILIUS	Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,	999
	The Roman emperor greets you all by me;	999
	And, for he understands you are in arms,	999
	He craves a parley at your father's house,	999
	Willing you to demand your hostages,	999
	And they shall be immediately deliver'd.	999
	999
First Goth	What says our general?	999
	999
LUCIUS	AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledges	999
	Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,	999
	And we will come. March away.	999

ACT V	999

	999
	999
SCENE II	Rome. Before TITUS's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON, disguised]	999
	999
TAMORA	Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,	999
	I will encounter with Andronicus,	999
	And say I am Revenge, sent from below	999
	To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.	999
	Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,	999
	To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;	999
	Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,	999
	And work confusion on his enemies.	999
	999
	[They knock]	999
	999
	[Enter TITUS, above]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Who doth molest my contemplation?	999
	Is it your trick to make me ope the door,	999
	That so my sad decrees may fly away,	999
	And all my study be to no effect?	999
	You are deceived: for what I mean to do	999
	See here in bloody lines I have set down;	999
	And what is written shall be executed.	999
	999
TAMORA	Titus, I am come to talk with thee.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,	999
	Wanting a hand to give it action?	999
	Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.	999
	999
TAMORA	If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with me.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	I am not mad; I know thee well enough:	999
	Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;	999
	Witness these trenches made by grief and care,	999
	Witness the tiring day and heavy night;	999
	Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well	999
	For our proud empress, mighty Tamora:	999
	Is not thy coming for my other hand?	999
	999
TAMORA	Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;	999
	She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:	999
	I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom,	999
	To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,	999
	By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.	999
	Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;	999
	Confer with me of murder and of death:	999
	There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,	999
	No vast obscurity or misty vale,	999
	Where bloody murder or detested rape	999
	Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;	999
	And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,	999
	Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,	999
	To be a torment to mine enemies?	999
	999
TAMORA	I am; therefore come down, and welcome me.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Do me some service, ere I come to thee.	999
	Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;	999
	Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge,	999
	Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels;	999
	And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,	999
	And whirl along with thee about the globe.	999
	Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,	999
	To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,	999
	And find out murderers in their guilty caves:	999
	And when thy car is loaden with their heads,	999
	I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel	999
	Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,	999
	Even from Hyperion's rising in the east	999
	Until his very downfall in the sea:	999
	And day by day I'll do this heavy task,	999
	So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.	999
	999
TAMORA	These are my ministers, and come with me.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?	999
	999
TAMORA	Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,	999
	Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!	999
	And you, the empress! but we worldly men	999
	Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.	999
	O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;	999
	And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,	999
	I will embrace thee in it by and by.	999
	999
	[Exit above]	999
	999
TAMORA	This closing with him fits his lunacy	999
	Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,	999
	Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,	999
	For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;	999
	And, being credulous in this mad thought,	999
	I'll make him send for Lucius his son;	999
	And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,	999
	I'll find some cunning practise out of hand,	999
	To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,	999
	Or, at the least, make them his enemies.	999
	See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.	999
	999
	[Enter TITUS below]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee:	999
	Welcome, dread Fury, to my woful house:	999
	Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.	999
	How like the empress and her sons you are!	999
	Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor:	999
	Could not all hell afford you such a devil?	999
	For well I wot the empress never wags	999
	But in her company there is a Moor;	999
	And, would you represent our queen aright,	999
	It were convenient you had such a devil:	999
	But welcome, as you are. What shall we do?	999
	999
TAMORA	What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.	999
	999
CHIRON	Show me a villain that hath done a rape,	999
	And I am sent to be revenged on him.	999
	999
TAMORA	Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,	999
	And I will be revenged on them all.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;	999
	And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself.	999
	Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.	999
	Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap	999
	To find another that is like to thee,	999
	Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher.	999
	Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court	999
	There is a queen, attended by a Moor;	999
	Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,	999
	for up and down she doth resemble thee:	999
	I pray thee, do on them some violent death;	999
	They have been violent to me and mine.	999
	999
TAMORA	Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.	999
	But would it please thee, good Andronicus,	999
	To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,	999
	Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,	999
	And bid him come and banquet at thy house;	999
	When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,	999
	I will bring in the empress and her sons,	999
	The emperor himself and all thy foes;	999
	And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,	999
	And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.	999
	What says Andronicus to this device?	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.	999
	999
	[Enter MARCUS]	999
	999
	Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;	999
	Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:	999
	Bid him repair to me, and bring with him	999
	Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;	999
	Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:	999
	Tell him the emperor and the empress too	999
	Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.	999
	This do thou for my love; and so let him,	999
	As he regards his aged father's life.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	This will I do, and soon return again.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
TAMORA	Now will I hence about thy business,	999
	And take my ministers along with me.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;	999
	Or else I'll call my brother back again,	999
	And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.	999
	999
TAMORA	[Aside to her sons]  What say you, boys? will you	999
	bide with him,	999
	Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor	999
	How I have govern'd our determined jest?	999
	Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,	999
	And tarry with him till I turn again.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	[Aside]  I know them all, though they suppose me mad,	999
	And will o'erreach them in their own devices:	999
	A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.	999
	999
TAMORA	Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes	999
	To lay a complot to betray thy foes.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit TAMORA]	999
	999
CHIRON	Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Tut, I have work enough for you to do.	999
	Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!	999
	999
	[Enter PUBLIUS and others]	999
	999
PUBLIUS	What is your will?	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Know you these two?	999
	999
PUBLIUS	The empress' sons, I take them, Chiron and Demetrius.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceived;	999
	The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name;	999
	And therefore bind them, gentle Publius.	999
	Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.	999
	Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,	999
	And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,	999
	And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[PUBLIUS, &c. lay hold on CHIRON and DEMETRIUS]	999
	999
CHIRON	Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.	999
	999
PUBLIUS	And therefore do we what we are commanded.	999
	Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.	999
	Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.	999
	999
	[Re-enter TITUS, with LAVINIA; he bearing a knife,	999
	and she a basin]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.	999
	Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;	999
	But let them hear what fearful words I utter.	999
	O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!	999
	Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,	999
	This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.	999
	You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault	999
	Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,	999
	My hand cut off and made a merry jest;	999
	Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear	999
	Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,	999
	Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forced.	999
	What would you say, if I should let you speak?	999
	Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.	999
	Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.	999
	This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,	999
	Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold	999
	The basin that receives your guilty blood.	999
	You know your mother means to feast with me,	999
	And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:	999
	Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust	999
	And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,	999
	And of the paste a coffin I will rear	999
	And make two pasties of your shameful heads,	999
	And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,	999
	Like to the earth swallow her own increase.	999
	This is the feast that I have bid her to,	999
	And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;	999
	For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,	999
	And worse than Progne I will be revenged:	999
	And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,	999
	999
	[He cuts their throats]	999
	999
	Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,	999
	Let me go grind their bones to powder small	999
	And with this hateful liquor temper it;	999
	And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.	999
	Come, come, be every one officious	999
	To make this banquet; which I wish may prove	999
	More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.	999
	So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook,	999
	And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.	999
	999

SCENE III	Court of TITUS's house. A banquet set out.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LUCIUS, MARCUS, and Goths, with AARON prisoner]	999
	999
LUCIUS	Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind	999
	That I repair to Rome, I am content.	999
	999
First Goth	And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,	999
	This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;	999
	Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him	999
	Till he be brought unto the empress' face,	999
	For testimony of her foul proceedings:	999
	And see the ambush of our friends be strong;	999
	I fear the emperor means no good to us.	999
	999
AARON	Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,	999
	And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth	999
	The venomous malice of my swelling heart!	999
	999
LUCIUS	Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!	999
	Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Goths, with AARON. Flourish within]	999
	999
	The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.	999
	999
	[Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA, with AEMILIUS,	999
	Tribunes, Senators, and others]	999
	999
SATURNINUS	What, hath the firmament more suns than one?	999
	999
LUCIUS	What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle;	999
	These quarrels must be quietly debated.	999
	The feast is ready, which the careful Titus	999
	Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,	999
	For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:	999
	Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Marcus, we will.	999
	999
	[Hautboys sound. The Company sit down at table]	999
	999
	[Enter TITUS dressed like a Cook, LAVINIA veiled,	999
	Young LUCIUS, and others. TITUS places the dishes	999
	on the table]	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;	999
	Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;	999
	And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,	999
	'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Because I would be sure to have all well,	999
	To entertain your highness and your empress.	999
	999
TAMORA	We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	An if your highness knew my heart, you were.	999
	My lord the emperor, resolve me this:	999
	Was it well done of rash Virginius	999
	To slay his daughter with his own right hand,	999
	Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?	999
	999
SATURNINUS	It was, Andronicus.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Your reason, mighty lord?	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Because the girl should not survive her shame,	999
	And by her presence still renew his sorrows.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;	999
	A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,	999
	For me, most wretched, to perform the like.	999
	Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;	999
	999
	[Kills LAVINIA]	999
	999
	And, with thy shame, thy father's sorrow die!	999
	999
SATURNINUS	What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.	999
	I am as woful as Virginius was,	999
	And have a thousand times more cause than he	999
	To do this outrage: and it now is done.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	What, was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Will't please you eat? will't please your	999
	highness feed?	999
	999
TAMORA	Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:	999
	They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue;	999
	And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Go fetch them hither to us presently.	999
	999
TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;	999
	Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,	999
	Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.	999
	'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.	999
	999
	[Kills TAMORA]	999
	999
SATURNINUS	Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!	999
	999
	[Kills TITUS]	999
	999
LUCIUS	Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?	999
	There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!	999
	999
	[Kills SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS, MARCUS,	999
	and others go up into the balcony]	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,	999
	By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl	999
	Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,	999
	O, let me teach you how to knit again	999
	This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,	999
	These broken limbs again into one body;	999
	Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,	999
	And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,	999
	Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,	999
	Do shameful execution on herself.	999
	But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,	999
	Grave witnesses of true experience,	999
	Cannot induce you to attend my words,	999
	999
	[To LUCIUS]	999
	999
	Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,	999
	When with his solemn tongue he did discourse	999
	To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear	999
	The story of that baleful burning night	999
	When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,	999
	Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,	999
	Or who hath brought the fatal engine in	999
	That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.	999
	My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;	999
	Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,	999
	But floods of tears will drown my oratory,	999
	And break my utterance, even in the time	999
	When it should move you to attend me most,	999
	Lending your kind commiseration.	999
	Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;	999
	Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,	999
	That cursed Chiron and Demetrius	999
	Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;	999
	And they it were that ravished our sister:	999
	For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;	999
	Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd	999
	Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,	999
	And sent her enemies unto the grave.	999
	Lastly, myself unkindly banished,	999
	The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,	999
	To beg relief among Rome's enemies:	999
	Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.	999
	And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.	999
	I am the turned forth, be it known to you,	999
	That have preserved her welfare in my blood;	999
	And from her bosom took the enemy's point,	999
	Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.	999
	Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;	999
	My scars can witness, dumb although they are,	999
	That my report is just and full of truth.	999
	But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,	999
	Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;	999
	For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:	999
	999
	[Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant]	999
	999
	Of this was Tamora delivered;	999
	The issue of an irreligious Moor,	999
	Chief architect and plotter of these woes:	999
	The villain is alive in Titus' house,	999
	And as he is, to witness this is true.	999
	Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge	999
	These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,	999
	Or more than any living man could bear.	999
	Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?	999
	Have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein,	999
	And, from the place where you behold us now,	999
	The poor remainder of Andronici	999
	Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.	999
	And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,	999
	And make a mutual closure of our house.	999
	Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,	999
	Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.	999
	999
AEMILIUS	Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,	999
	And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,	999
	Lucius our emperor; for well I know	999
	The common voice do cry it shall be so.	999
	999
All	Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,	999
	999
	[To Attendants]	999
	999
	And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,	999
	To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,	999
	As punishment for his most wicked life.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Attendants]	999
	999
	[LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend]	999
	999
All	Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!	999
	999
LUCIUS	Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,	999
	To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!	999
	But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,	999
	For nature puts me to a heavy task:	999
	Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,	999
	To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.	999
	O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,	999
	999
	[Kissing TITUS]	999
	999
	These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,	999
	The last true duties of thy noble son!	999
	999
MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,	999
	Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:	999
	O were the sum of these that I should pay	999
	Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!	999
	999
LUCIUS	Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us	999
	To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:	999
	Many a time he danced thee on his knee,	999
	Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:	999
	Many a matter hath he told to thee,	999
	Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;	999
	In that respect, then, like a loving child,	999
	Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,	999
	Because kind nature doth require it so:	999
	Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:	999
	Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;	999
	Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.	999
	999
Young LUCIUS	O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart	999
	Would I were dead, so you did live again!	999
	O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;	999
	My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Attendants with AARON]	999
	999
AEMILIUS	You sad Andronici, have done with woes:	999
	Give sentence on this execrable wretch,	999
	That hath been breeder of these dire events.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;	999
	There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;	999
	If any one relieves or pities him,	999
	For the offence he dies. This is our doom:	999
	Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.	999
	999
AARON	O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?	999
	I am no baby, I, that with base prayers	999
	I should repent the evils I have done:	999
	Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did	999
	Would I perform, if I might have my will;	999
	If one good deed in all my life I did,	999
	I do repent it from my very soul.	999
	999
LUCIUS	Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,	999
	And give him burial in his father's grave:	999
	My father and Lavinia shall forthwith	999
	Be closed in our household's monument.	999
	As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,	999
	No funeral rite, nor man m mourning weeds,	999
	No mournful bell shall ring her burial;	999
	But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:	999
	Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;	999
	And, being so, shall have like want of pity.	999
	See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,	999
	By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:	999
	Then, afterwards, to order well the state,	999
	That like events may ne'er it ruinate.	999

	PROLOGUE	999
	999
	999
	In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece	999
	The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,	999
	Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,	999
	Fraught with the ministers and instruments	999
	Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore	999
	Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay	999
	Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made	999
	To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures	999
	The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,	999
	With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.	999
	To Tenedos they come;	999
	And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge	999
	Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains	999
	The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch	999
	Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,	999
	Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,	999
	And Antenorides, with massy staples	999
	And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,	999
	Sperr up the sons of Troy.	999
	Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,	999
	On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,	999
	Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come	999
	A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence	999
	Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited	999
	In like conditions as our argument,	999
	To tell you, fair beholders, that our play	999
	Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,	999
	Beginning in the middle, starting thence away	999
	To what may be digested in a play.	999
	Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:	999
	Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Troy. Before Priam's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS]	999
	999
TROILUS	Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:	999
	Why should I war without the walls of Troy,	999
	That find such cruel battle here within?	999
	Each Trojan that is master of his heart,	999
	Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Will this gear ne'er be mended?	999
	999
TROILUS	The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,	999
	Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;	999
	But I am weaker than a woman's tear,	999
	Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,	999
	Less valiant than the virgin in the night	999
	And skilless as unpractised infancy.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,	999
	I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will	999
	have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.	999
	999
TROILUS	Have I not tarried?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry	999
	the bolting.	999
	999
TROILUS	Have I not tarried?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.	999
	999
TROILUS	Still have I tarried.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word	999
	'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the	999
	heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must	999
	stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.	999
	999
TROILUS	Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,	999
	Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.	999
	At Priam's royal table do I sit;	999
	And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--	999
	So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw	999
	her look, or any woman else.	999
	999
TROILUS	I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,	999
	As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,	999
	Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,	999
	I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,	999
	Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:	999
	But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,	999
	Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.	999
	999
PANDARUS	An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--	999
	well, go to--there were no more comparison between	999
	the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I	999
	would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would	999
	somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I	999
	will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--	999
	999
TROILUS	O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--	999
	When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,	999
	Reply not in how many fathoms deep	999
	They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad	999
	In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'	999
	Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart	999
	Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,	999
	Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,	999
	In whose comparison all whites are ink,	999
	Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure	999
	The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense	999
	Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,	999
	As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;	999
	But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,	999
	Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me	999
	The knife that made it.	999
	999
PANDARUS	I speak no more than truth.	999
	999
TROILUS	Thou dost not speak so much.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:	999
	if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be	999
	not, she has the mends in her own hands.	999
	999
TROILUS	Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!	999
	999
PANDARUS	I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of	999
	her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and	999
	between, but small thanks for my labour.	999
	999
TROILUS	What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair	999
	as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as	999
	fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care	999
	I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.	999
	999
TROILUS	Say I she is not fair?	999
	999
PANDARUS	I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to	999
	stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so	999
	I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,	999
	I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.	999
	999
TROILUS	Pandarus,--	999
	999
PANDARUS	Not I.	999
	999
TROILUS	Sweet Pandarus,--	999
	999
PANDARUS	Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I	999
	found it, and there an end.	999
	999
	[Exit PANDARUS. An alarum]	999
	999
TROILUS	Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!	999
	Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,	999
	When with your blood you daily paint her thus.	999
	I cannot fight upon this argument;	999
	It is too starved a subject for my sword.	999
	But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!	999
	I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;	999
	And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.	999
	As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.	999
	Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,	999
	What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?	999
	Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:	999
	Between our Ilium and where she resides,	999
	Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,	999
	Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar	999
	Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.	999
	999
	[Alarum. Enter AENEAS]	999
	999
AENEAS	How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?	999
	999
TROILUS	Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,	999
	For womanish it is to be from thence.	999
	What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?	999
	999
AENEAS	That Paris is returned home and hurt.	999
	999
TROILUS	By whom, AEneas?	999
	999
AENEAS	                  Troilus, by Menelaus.	999
	999
TROILUS	Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;	999
	Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.	999
	999
	[Alarum]	999
	999
AENEAS	Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!	999
	999
TROILUS	Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'	999
	But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?	999
	999
AENEAS	In all swift haste.	999
	999
TROILUS	Come, go we then together.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	999
	999
	999
	TROILUS AND CRESSIDA	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	The Same. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER]	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Who were those went by?	999
	999
ALEXANDER	Queen Hecuba and Helen.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	And whither go they?	999
	999
ALEXANDER	Up to the eastern tower,	999
	Whose height commands as subject all the vale,	999
	To see the battle. Hector, whose patience	999
	Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:	999
	He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,	999
	And, like as there were husbandry in war,	999
	Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,	999
	And to the field goes he; where every flower	999
	Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw	999
	In Hector's wrath.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	                  What was his cause of anger?	999
	999
ALEXANDER	The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks	999
	A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;	999
	They call him Ajax.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Good; and what of him?	999
	999
ALEXANDER	They say he is a very man per se,	999
	And stands alone.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.	999
	999
ALEXANDER	This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their	999
	particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,	999
	churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man	999
	into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his	999
	valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with	999
	discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he	999
	hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he	999
	carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without	999
	cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the	999
	joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint	999
	that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,	999
	or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	But how should this man, that makes	999
	me smile, make Hector angry?	999
	999
ALEXANDER	They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and	999
	struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath	999
	ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Who comes here?	999
	999
ALEXANDER	Madam, your uncle Pandarus.	999
	999
	[Enter PANDARUS]	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Hector's a gallant man.	999
	999
ALEXANDER	As may be in the world, lady.	999
	999
PANDARUS	What's that? what's that?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?	999
	Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When	999
	were you at Ilium?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	This morning, uncle.	999
	999
PANDARUS	What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector	999
	armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not	999
	up, was she?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Even so: Hector was stirring early.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	That were we talking of, and of his anger.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Was he angry?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	So he says here.	999
	999
PANDARUS	True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay	999
	about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's	999
	Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take	999
	heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	What, is he angry too?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	O Jupiter! there's no comparison.	999
	999
PANDARUS	What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a	999
	man if you see him?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.	999
	999
PANDARUS	No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	So he is.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	He is not Hector.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were	999
	himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend	999
	or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were	999
	in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Excuse me.	999
	999
PANDARUS	He is elder.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Pardon me, pardon me.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another	999
	tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not	999
	have his wit this year.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	He shall not need it, if he have his own.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Nor his qualities.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	No matter.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Nor his beauty.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	'Twould not become him; his own's better.	999
	999
PANDARUS	You have no judgment, niece: Helen	999
	herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for	999
	a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--	999
	not brown neither,--	999
	999
CRESSIDA	No, but brown.	999
	999
PANDARUS	'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	To say the truth, true and not true.	999
	999
PANDARUS	She praised his complexion above Paris.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Why, Paris hath colour enough.	999
	999
PANDARUS	So he has.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised	999
	him above, his complexion is higher than his; he	999
	having colour enough, and the other higher, is too	999
	flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as	999
	lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for	999
	a copper nose.	999
	999
PANDARUS	I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Then she's a merry Greek indeed.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other	999
	day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he	999
	has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his	999
	particulars therein to a total.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within	999
	three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?	999
	999
PANDARUS	But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came	999
	and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling	999
	becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	O, he smiles valiantly.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Does he not?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen	999
	loves Troilus,--	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll	999
	prove it so.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem	999
	an addle egg.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle	999
	head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.	999
	999
PANDARUS	I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled	999
	his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I	999
	must needs confess,--	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Without the rack.	999
	999
PANDARUS	And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.	999
	999
PANDARUS	But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed	999
	that her eyes ran o'er.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	With mill-stones.	999
	999
PANDARUS	And Cassandra laughed.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	But there was more temperate fire under the pot of	999
	her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?	999
	999
PANDARUS	And Hector laughed.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	At what was all this laughing?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed	999
	too.	999
	999
PANDARUS	They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	What was his answer?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your	999
	chin, and one of them is white.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	This is her question.	999
	999
PANDARUS	That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and	999
	fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white	999
	hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'	999
	'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,	999
	my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't	999
	out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!	999
	and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the	999
	rest so laughed, that it passed.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	So let it now; for it has been while going by.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	So I do.	999
	999
PANDARUS	I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere	999
	a man born in April.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle	999
	against May.	999
	999
	[A retreat sounded]	999
	999
PANDARUS	Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we	999
	stand up here, and see them as they pass toward	999
	Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	At your pleasure.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may	999
	see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their	999
	names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Speak not so loud.	999
	999
	[AENEAS passes]	999
	999
PANDARUS	That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of	999
	the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark	999
	Troilus; you shall see anon.	999
	999
	[ANTENOR passes]	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Who's that?	999
	999
PANDARUS	That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;	999
	and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest	999
	judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.	999
	When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if	999
	he see me, you shall see him nod at me.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Will he give you the nod?	999
	999
PANDARUS	You shall see.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	If he do, the rich shall have more.	999
	999
	[HECTOR passes]	999
	999
PANDARUS	That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a	999
	fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,	999
	niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's	999
	a countenance! is't not a brave man?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	O, a brave man!	999
	999
PANDARUS	Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you	999
	what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do	999
	you see? look you there: there's no jesting;	999
	there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:	999
	there be hacks!	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Be those with swords?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil come	999
	to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's	999
	heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.	999
	999
	[PARIS passes]	999
	999
	Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,	999
	is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came	999
	hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do	999
	Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see	999
	Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.	999
	999
	[HELENUS passes]	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Who's that?	999
	999
PANDARUS	That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's	999
	Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Can Helenus fight, uncle?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I	999
	marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the	999
	people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	What sneaking fellow comes yonder?	999
	999
	[TROILUS passes]	999
	999
PANDARUS	Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!	999
	there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the	999
	prince of chivalry!	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Peace, for shame, peace!	999
	999
PANDARUS	Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon	999
	him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and	999
	his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,	999
	and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw	999
	three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!	999
	Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,	999
	he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?	999
	Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to	999
	change, would give an eye to boot.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Here come more.	999
	999
	[Forces pass]	999
	999
PANDARUS	Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!	999
	porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the	999
	eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles	999
	are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had	999
	rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and	999
	all Greece.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Well, well.	999
	999
PANDARUS	'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have	999
	you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not	999
	birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,	999
	learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,	999
	and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date	999
	in the pie, for then the man's date's out.	999
	999
PANDARUS	You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you	999
	lie.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to	999
	defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine	999
	honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to	999
	defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a	999
	thousand watches.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Say one of your watches.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the	999
	chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would	999
	not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took	999
	the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's	999
	past watching.	999
	999
PANDARUS	You are such another!	999
	999
	[Enter Troilus's Boy]	999
	999
Boy	Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Where?	999
	999
Boy	At your own house; there he unarms him.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Good boy, tell him I come.	999
	999
	[Exit boy]	999
	999
	I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Adieu, uncle.	999
	999
PANDARUS	I'll be with you, niece, by and by.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	To bring, uncle?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Ay, a token from Troilus.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	By the same token, you are a bawd.	999
	999
	[Exit PANDARUS]	999
	999
	Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,	999
	He offers in another's enterprise;	999
	But more in Troilus thousand fold I see	999
	Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;	999
	Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:	999
	Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.	999
	That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:	999
	Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:	999
	That she was never yet that ever knew	999
	Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.	999
	Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:	999
	Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:	999
	Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,	999
	Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.	999
	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.	999
	999
	999
	[Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES,	999
	MENELAUS, and others]	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Princes,	999
	What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?	999
	The ample proposition that hope makes	999
	In all designs begun on earth below	999
	Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters	999
	Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,	999
	As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,	999
	Infect the sound pine and divert his grain	999
	Tortive and errant from his course of growth.	999
	Nor, princes, is it matter new to us	999
	That we come short of our suppose so far	999
	That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;	999
	Sith every action that hath gone before,	999
	Whereof we have record, trial did draw	999
	Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,	999
	And that unbodied figure of the thought	999
	That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,	999
	Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,	999
	And call them shames? which are indeed nought else	999
	But the protractive trials of great Jove	999
	To find persistive constancy in men:	999
	The fineness of which metal is not found	999
	In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,	999
	The wise and fool, the artist and unread,	999
	The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:	999
	But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,	999
	Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,	999
	Puffing at all, winnows the light away;	999
	And what hath mass or matter, by itself	999
	Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.	999
	999
NESTOR	With due observance of thy godlike seat,	999
	Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply	999
	Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance	999
	Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,	999
	How many shallow bauble boats dare sail	999
	Upon her patient breast, making their way	999
	With those of nobler bulk!	999
	But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage	999
	The gentle Thetis, and anon behold	999
	The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,	999
	Bounding between the two moist elements,	999
	Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat	999
	Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now	999
	Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,	999
	Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so	999
	Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide	999
	In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness	999
	The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze	999
	Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind	999
	Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,	999
	And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage	999
	As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,	999
	And with an accent tuned in selfsame key	999
	Retorts to chiding fortune.	999
	999
ULYSSES	Agamemnon,	999
	Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,	999
	Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.	999
	In whom the tempers and the minds of all	999
	Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.	999
	Besides the applause and approbation To which,	999
	999
	[To AGAMEMNON]	999
	999
	most mighty for thy place and sway,	999
	999
	[To NESTOR]	999
	999
	And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life	999
	I give to both your speeches, which were such	999
	As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece	999
	Should hold up high in brass, and such again	999
	As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,	999
	Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree	999
	On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears	999
	To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,	999
	Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect	999
	That matter needless, of importless burden,	999
	Divide thy lips, than we are confident,	999
	When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,	999
	We shall hear music, wit and oracle.	999
	999
ULYSSES	Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,	999
	And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,	999
	But for these instances.	999
	The specialty of rule hath been neglected:	999
	And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand	999
	Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.	999
	When that the general is not like the hive	999
	To whom the foragers shall all repair,	999
	What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,	999
	The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.	999
	The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre	999
	Observe degree, priority and place,	999
	Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,	999
	Office and custom, in all line of order;	999
	And therefore is the glorious planet Sol	999
	In noble eminence enthroned and sphered	999
	Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye	999
	Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,	999
	And posts, like the commandment of a king,	999
	Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets	999
	In evil mixture to disorder wander,	999
	What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!	999
	What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!	999
	Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,	999
	Divert and crack, rend and deracinate	999
	The unity and married calm of states	999
	Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,	999
	Which is the ladder to all high designs,	999
	Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,	999
	Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,	999
	Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,	999
	The primogenitive and due of birth,	999
	Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,	999
	But by degree, stand in authentic place?	999
	Take but degree away, untune that string,	999
	And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets	999
	In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters	999
	Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores	999
	And make a sop of all this solid globe:	999
	Strength should be lord of imbecility,	999
	And the rude son should strike his father dead:	999
	Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,	999
	Between whose endless jar justice resides,	999
	Should lose their names, and so should justice too.	999
	Then every thing includes itself in power,	999
	Power into will, will into appetite;	999
	And appetite, an universal wolf,	999
	So doubly seconded with will and power,	999
	Must make perforce an universal prey,	999
	And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,	999
	This chaos, when degree is suffocate,	999
	Follows the choking.	999
	And this neglection of degree it is	999
	That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose	999
	It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd	999
	By him one step below, he by the next,	999
	That next by him beneath; so every step,	999
	Exampled by the first pace that is sick	999
	Of his superior, grows to an envious fever	999
	Of pale and bloodless emulation:	999
	And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,	999
	Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,	999
	Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.	999
	999
NESTOR	Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd	999
	The fever whereof all our power is sick.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,	999
	What is the remedy?	999
	999
ULYSSES	The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns	999
	The sinew and the forehand of our host,	999
	Having his ear full of his airy fame,	999
	Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent	999
	Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus	999
	Upon a lazy bed the livelong day	999
	Breaks scurril jests;	999
	And with ridiculous and awkward action,	999
	Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,	999
	He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,	999
	Thy topless deputation he puts on,	999
	And, like a strutting player, whose conceit	999
	Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich	999
	To hear the wooden dialogue and sound	999
	'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--	999
	Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming	999
	He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,	999
	'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,	999
	Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd	999
	Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff	999
	The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,	999
	From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;	999
	Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.	999
	Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,	999
	As he being drest to some oration.'	999
	That's done, as near as the extremest ends	999
	Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:	999
	Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!	999
	'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,	999
	Arming to answer in a night alarm.'	999
	And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age	999
	Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,	999
	And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,	999
	Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport	999
	Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;	999
	Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all	999
	In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,	999
	All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,	999
	Severals and generals of grace exact,	999
	Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,	999
	Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,	999
	Success or loss, what is or is not, serves	999
	As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.	999
	999
NESTOR	And in the imitation of these twain--	999
	Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns	999
	With an imperial voice--many are infect.	999
	Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head	999
	In such a rein, in full as proud a place	999
	As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;	999
	Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,	999
	Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,	999
	A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,	999
	To match us in comparisons with dirt,	999
	To weaken and discredit our exposure,	999
	How rank soever rounded in with danger.	999
	999
ULYSSES	They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,	999
	Count wisdom as no member of the war,	999
	Forestall prescience, and esteem no act	999
	But that of hand: the still and mental parts,	999
	That do contrive how many hands shall strike,	999
	When fitness calls them on, and know by measure	999
	Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--	999
	Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:	999
	They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;	999
	So that the ram that batters down the wall,	999
	For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,	999
	They place before his hand that made the engine,	999
	Or those that with the fineness of their souls	999
	By reason guide his execution.	999
	999
NESTOR	Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse	999
	Makes many Thetis' sons.	999
	999
	[A tucket]	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	What trumpet? look, Menelaus.	999
	999
MENELAUS	From Troy.	999
	999
	[Enter AENEAS]	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	What would you 'fore our tent?	999
	999
AENEAS	Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Even this.	999
	999
AENEAS	May one, that is a herald and a prince,	999
	Do a fair message to his kingly ears?	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	With surety stronger than Achilles' arm	999
	'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice	999
	Call Agamemnon head and general.	999
	999
AENEAS	Fair leave and large security. How may	999
	A stranger to those most imperial looks	999
	Know them from eyes of other mortals?	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	How!	999
	999
AENEAS	Ay;	999
	I ask, that I might waken reverence,	999
	And bid the cheek be ready with a blush	999
	Modest as morning when she coldly eyes	999
	The youthful Phoebus:	999
	Which is that god in office, guiding men?	999
	Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy	999
	Are ceremonious courtiers.	999
	999
AENEAS	Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,	999
	As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:	999
	But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,	999
	Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,	999
	Jove's accord,	999
	Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,	999
	Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!	999
	The worthiness of praise distains his worth,	999
	If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:	999
	But what the repining enemy commends,	999
	That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,	999
	transcends.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?	999
	999
AENEAS	Ay, Greek, that is my name.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	What's your affair I pray you?	999
	999
AENEAS	Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.	999
	999
AENEAS	Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:	999
	I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,	999
	To set his sense on the attentive bent,	999
	And then to speak.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	                  Speak frankly as the wind;	999
	It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:	999
	That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,	999
	He tells thee so himself.	999
	999
AENEAS	Trumpet, blow loud,	999
	Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;	999
	And every Greek of mettle, let him know,	999
	What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.	999
	999
	[Trumpet sounds]	999
	999
	We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy	999
	A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--	999
	Who in this dull and long-continued truce	999
	Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,	999
	And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!	999
	If there be one among the fair'st of Greece	999
	That holds his honour higher than his ease,	999
	That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,	999
	That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,	999
	That loves his mistress more than in confession,	999
	With truant vows to her own lips he loves,	999
	And dare avow her beauty and her worth	999
	In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.	999
	Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,	999
	Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,	999
	He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,	999
	Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,	999
	And will to-morrow with his trumpet call	999
	Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,	999
	To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:	999
	If any come, Hector shall honour him;	999
	If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,	999
	The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth	999
	The splinter of a lance. Even so much.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;	999
	If none of them have soul in such a kind,	999
	We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;	999
	And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,	999
	That means not, hath not, or is not in love!	999
	If then one is, or hath, or means to be,	999
	That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.	999
	999
NESTOR	Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man	999
	When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;	999
	But if there be not in our Grecian host	999
	One noble man that hath one spark of fire,	999
	To answer for his love, tell him from me	999
	I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver	999
	And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,	999
	And meeting him will tell him that my lady	999
	Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste	999
	As may be in the world: his youth in flood,	999
	I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.	999
	999
AENEAS	Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!	999
	999
ULYSSES	Amen.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;	999
	To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.	999
	Achilles shall have word of this intent;	999
	So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:	999
	Yourself shall feast with us before you go	999
	And find the welcome of a noble foe.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR]	999
	999
ULYSSES	Nestor!	999
	999
NESTOR	What says Ulysses?	999
	999
ULYSSES	I have a young conception in my brain;	999
	Be you my time to bring it to some shape.	999
	999
NESTOR	What is't?	999
	999
ULYSSES	This 'tis:	999
	Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride	999
	That hath to this maturity blown up	999
	In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,	999
	Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,	999
	To overbulk us all.	999
	999
NESTOR	Well, and how?	999
	999
ULYSSES	This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,	999
	However it is spread in general name,	999
	Relates in purpose only to Achilles.	999
	999
NESTOR	The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,	999
	Whose grossness little characters sum up:	999
	And, in the publication, make no strain,	999
	But that Achilles, were his brain as barren	999
	As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,	999
	'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,	999
	Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose	999
	Pointing on him.	999
	999
ULYSSES	And wake him to the answer, think you?	999
	999
NESTOR	Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,	999
	That can from Hector bring his honour off,	999
	If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,	999
	Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;	999
	For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute	999
	With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,	999
	Our imputation shall be oddly poised	999
	In this wild action; for the success,	999
	Although particular, shall give a scantling	999
	Of good or bad unto the general;	999
	And in such indexes, although small pricks	999
	To their subsequent volumes, there is seen	999
	The baby figure of the giant mass	999
	Of things to come at large. It is supposed	999
	He that meets Hector issues from our choice	999
	And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,	999
	Makes merit her election, and doth boil,	999
	As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd	999
	Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,	999
	What heart receives from hence the conquering part,	999
	To steel a strong opinion to themselves?	999
	Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,	999
	In no less working than are swords and bows	999
	Directive by the limbs.	999
	999
ULYSSES	Give pardon to my speech:	999
	Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.	999
	Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,	999
	And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,	999
	The lustre of the better yet to show,	999
	Shall show the better. Do not consent	999
	That ever Hector and Achilles meet;	999
	For both our honour and our shame in this	999
	Are dogg'd with two strange followers.	999
	999
NESTOR	I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?	999
	999
ULYSSES	What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,	999
	Were he not proud, we all should share with him:	999
	But he already is too insolent;	999
	And we were better parch in Afric sun	999
	Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,	999
	Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,	999
	Why then, we did our main opinion crush	999
	In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;	999
	And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw	999
	The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves	999
	Give him allowance for the better man;	999
	For that will physic the great Myrmidon	999
	Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall	999
	His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.	999
	If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,	999
	We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,	999
	Yet go we under our opinion still	999
	That we have better men. But, hit or miss,	999
	Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:	999
	Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.	999
	999
NESTOR	Ulysses,	999
	Now I begin to relish thy advice;	999
	And I will give a taste of it forthwith	999
	To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.	999
	Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone	999
	Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.	999

SCENE I	A part of the Grecian camp.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter AJAX and THERSITES]	999
	999
AJAX	Thersites!	999
	999
THERSITES	Agamemnon, how if he had boils? full, all over,	999
	generally?	999
	999
AJAX	Thersites!	999
	999
THERSITES	And those boils did run? say so: did not the	999
	general run then? were not that a botchy core?	999
	999
AJAX	Dog!	999
	999
THERSITES	Then would come some matter from him; I see none now.	999
	999
AJAX	Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?	999
	999
	[Beating him]	999
	999
	Feel, then.	999
	999
THERSITES	The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel	999
	beef-witted lord!	999
	999
AJAX	Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will	999
	beat thee into handsomeness.	999
	999
THERSITES	I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but,	999
	I think, thy horse will sooner con an oration than	999
	thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,	999
	canst thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!	999
	999
AJAX	Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.	999
	999
THERSITES	Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?	999
	999
AJAX	The proclamation!	999
	999
THERSITES	Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.	999
	999
AJAX	Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.	999
	999
THERSITES	I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had	999
	the scratching of thee; I would make thee the	999
	loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in	999
	the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.	999
	999
AJAX	I say, the proclamation!	999
	999
THERSITES	Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,	999
	and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as	999
	Cerberus is at Proserpine's beauty, ay, that thou	999
	barkest at him.	999
	999
AJAX	Mistress Thersites!	999
	999
THERSITES	Thou shouldest strike him.	999
	999
AJAX	Cobloaf!	999
	999
THERSITES	He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a	999
	sailor breaks a biscuit.	999
	999
AJAX	[Beating him]  You whoreson cur!	999
	999
THERSITES	Do, do.	999
	999
AJAX	Thou stool for a witch!	999
	999
THERSITES	Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no	999
	more brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinego	999
	may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art	999
	here but to thrash Trojans; and thou art bought and	999
	sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave.	999
	If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel, and	999
	tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no	999
	bowels, thou!	999
	999
AJAX	You dog!	999
	999
THERSITES	You scurvy lord!	999
	999
AJAX	[Beating him]  You cur!	999
	999
THERSITES	Mars his idiot! do, rudeness; do, camel; do, do.	999
	999
	[Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS]	999
	999
ACHILLES	Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,	999
	Thersites! what's the matter, man?	999
	999
THERSITES	You see him there, do you?	999
	999
ACHILLES	Ay; what's the matter?	999
	999
THERSITES	Nay, look upon him.	999
	999
ACHILLES	So I do: what's the matter?	999
	999
THERSITES	Nay, but regard him well.	999
	999
ACHILLES	'Well!' why, I do so.	999
	999
THERSITES	But yet you look not well upon him; for whosoever you	999
	take him to be, he is Ajax.	999
	999
ACHILLES	I know that, fool.	999
	999
THERSITES	Ay, but that fool knows not himself.	999
	999
AJAX	Therefore I beat thee.	999
	999
THERSITES	Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! his	999
	evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his	999
	brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy	999
	nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not	999
	worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord,	999
	Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly and	999
	his guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say of	999
	him.	999
	999
ACHILLES	What?	999
	999
THERSITES	I say, this Ajax--	999
	999
	[Ajax offers to beat him]	999
	999
ACHILLES	Nay, good Ajax.	999
	999
THERSITES	Has not so much wit--	999
	999
ACHILLES	Nay, I must hold you.	999
	999
THERSITES	As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he	999
	comes to fight.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Peace, fool!	999
	999
THERSITES	I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will	999
	not: he there: that he: look you there.	999
	999
AJAX	O thou damned cur! I shall--	999
	999
ACHILLES	Will you set your wit to a fool's?	999
	999
THERSITES	No, I warrant you; for a fools will shame it.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Good words, Thersites.	999
	999
ACHILLES	What's the quarrel?	999
	999
AJAX	I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the	999
	proclamation, and he rails upon me.	999
	999
THERSITES	I serve thee not.	999
	999
AJAX	Well, go to, go to.	999
	999
THERSITES	I serve here voluntarily.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Your last service was sufferance, 'twas not	999
	voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was	999
	here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.	999
	999
THERSITES	E'en so; a great deal of your wit, too, lies in your	999
	sinews, or else there be liars. Hector have a great	999
	catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a'	999
	were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.	999
	999
ACHILLES	What, with me too, Thersites?	999
	999
THERSITES	There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldy	999
	ere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke you	999
	like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.	999
	999
ACHILLES	What, what?	999
	999
THERSITES	Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!	999
	999
AJAX	I shall cut out your tongue.	999
	999
THERSITES	'Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thou	999
	afterwards.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	No more words, Thersites; peace!	999
	999
THERSITES	I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?	999
	999
ACHILLES	There's for you, Patroclus.	999
	999
THERSITES	I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come	999
	any more to your tents: I will keep where there is	999
	wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PATROCLUS	A good riddance.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host:	999
	That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,	999
	Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy	999
	To-morrow morning call some knight to arms	999
	That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare	999
	Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.	999
	999
AJAX	Farewell. Who shall answer him?	999
	999
ACHILLES	I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwise	999
	He knew his man.	999
	999
AJAX	O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Troy. A room in Priam's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUS]	999
	999
PRIAM	After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,	999
	Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:	999
	'Deliver Helen, and all damage else--	999
	As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,	999
	Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed	999
	In hot digestion of this cormorant war--	999
	Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?	999
	999
HECTOR	Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I	999
	As far as toucheth my particular,	999
	Yet, dread Priam,	999
	There is no lady of more softer bowels,	999
	More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,	999
	More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'	999
	Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,	999
	Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd	999
	The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches	999
	To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:	999
	Since the first sword was drawn about this question,	999
	Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,	999
	Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:	999
	If we have lost so many tenths of ours,	999
	To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,	999
	Had it our name, the value of one ten,	999
	What merit's in that reason which denies	999
	The yielding of her up?	999
	999
TROILUS	Fie, fie, my brother!	999
	Weigh you the worth and honour of a king	999
	So great as our dread father in a scale	999
	Of common ounces? will you with counters sum	999
	The past proportion of his infinite?	999
	And buckle in a waist most fathomless	999
	With spans and inches so diminutive	999
	As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!	999
	999
HELENUS	No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,	999
	You are so empty of them. Should not our father	999
	Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,	999
	Because your speech hath none that tells him so?	999
	999
TROILUS	You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;	999
	You fur your gloves with reason. Here are	999
	your reasons:	999
	You know an enemy intends you harm;	999
	You know a sword employ'd is perilous,	999
	And reason flies the object of all harm:	999
	Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds	999
	A Grecian and his sword, if he do set	999
	The very wings of reason to his heels	999
	And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,	999
	Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,	999
	Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour	999
	Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat	999
	their thoughts	999
	With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect	999
	Make livers pale and lustihood deject.	999
	999
HECTOR	Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost	999
	The holding.	999
	999
TROILUS	                  What is aught, but as 'tis valued?	999
	999
HECTOR	But value dwells not in particular will;	999
	It holds his estimate and dignity	999
	As well wherein 'tis precious of itself	999
	As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry	999
	To make the service greater than the god	999
	And the will dotes that is attributive	999
	To what infectiously itself affects,	999
	Without some image of the affected merit.	999
	999
TROILUS	I take to-day a wife, and my election	999
	Is led on in the conduct of my will;	999
	My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,	999
	Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores	999
	Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,	999
	Although my will distaste what it elected,	999
	The wife I chose? there can be no evasion	999
	To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:	999
	We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,	999
	When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands	999
	We do not throw in unrespective sieve,	999
	Because we now are full. It was thought meet	999
	Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:	999
	Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;	999
	The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce	999
	And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,	999
	And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,	999
	He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness	999
	Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.	999
	Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:	999
	Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,	999
	Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,	999
	And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.	999
	If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--	999
	As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--	999
	If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--	999
	As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands	999
	And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now	999
	The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,	999
	And do a deed that fortune never did,	999
	Beggar the estimation which you prized	999
	Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,	999
	That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!	999
	But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,	999
	That in their country did them that disgrace,	999
	We fear to warrant in our native place!	999
	999
CASSANDRA	[Within]  Cry, Trojans, cry!	999
	999
PRIAM	What noise? what shriek is this?	999
	999
TROILUS	'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.	999
	999
CASSANDRA	[Within]  Cry, Trojans!	999
	999
HECTOR	It is Cassandra.	999
	999
	[Enter CASSANDRA, raving]	999
	999
CASSANDRA	Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,	999
	And I will fill them with prophetic tears.	999
	999
HECTOR	Peace, sister, peace!	999
	999
CASSANDRA	Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,	999
	Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,	999
	Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes	999
	A moiety of that mass of moan to come.	999
	Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!	999
	Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;	999
	Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.	999
	Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:	999
	Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HECTOR	Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains	999
	Of divination in our sister work	999
	Some touches of remorse? or is your blood	999
	So madly hot that no discourse of reason,	999
	Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,	999
	Can qualify the same?	999
	999
TROILUS	Why, brother Hector,	999
	We may not think the justness of each act	999
	Such and no other than event doth form it,	999
	Nor once deject the courage of our minds,	999
	Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures	999
	Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel	999
	Which hath our several honours all engaged	999
	To make it gracious. For my private part,	999
	I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:	999
	And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us	999
	Such things as might offend the weakest spleen	999
	To fight for and maintain!	999
	999
PARIS	Else might the world convince of levity	999
	As well my undertakings as your counsels:	999
	But I attest the gods, your full consent	999
	Gave wings to my propension and cut off	999
	All fears attending on so dire a project.	999
	For what, alas, can these my single arms?	999
	What Propugnation is in one man's valour,	999
	To stand the push and enmity of those	999
	This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,	999
	Were I alone to pass the difficulties	999
	And had as ample power as I have will,	999
	Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,	999
	Nor faint in the pursuit.	999
	999
PRIAM	Paris, you speak	999
	Like one besotted on your sweet delights:	999
	You have the honey still, but these the gall;	999
	So to be valiant is no praise at all.	999
	999
PARIS	Sir, I propose not merely to myself	999
	The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;	999
	But I would have the soil of her fair rape	999
	Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.	999
	What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,	999
	Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,	999
	Now to deliver her possession up	999
	On terms of base compulsion! Can it be	999
	That so degenerate a strain as this	999
	Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?	999
	There's not the meanest spirit on our party	999
	Without a heart to dare or sword to draw	999
	When Helen is defended, nor none so noble	999
	Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed	999
	Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,	999
	Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,	999
	The world's large spaces cannot parallel.	999
	999
HECTOR	Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,	999
	And on the cause and question now in hand	999
	Have glozed, but superficially: not much	999
	Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought	999
	Unfit to hear moral philosophy:	999
	The reasons you allege do more conduce	999
	To the hot passion of distemper'd blood	999
	Than to make up a free determination	999
	'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge	999
	Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice	999
	Of any true decision. Nature craves	999
	All dues be render'd to their owners: now,	999
	What nearer debt in all humanity	999
	Than wife is to the husband? If this law	999
	Of nature be corrupted through affection,	999
	And that great minds, of partial indulgence	999
	To their benumbed wills, resist the same,	999
	There is a law in each well-order'd nation	999
	To curb those raging appetites that are	999
	Most disobedient and refractory.	999
	If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,	999
	As it is known she is, these moral laws	999
	Of nature and of nations speak aloud	999
	To have her back return'd: thus to persist	999
	In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,	999
	But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion	999
	Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,	999
	My spritely brethren, I propend to you	999
	In resolution to keep Helen still,	999
	For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance	999
	Upon our joint and several dignities.	999
	999
TROILUS	Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:	999
	Were it not glory that we more affected	999
	Than the performance of our heaving spleens,	999
	I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood	999
	Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,	999
	She is a theme of honour and renown,	999
	A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,	999
	Whose present courage may beat down our foes,	999
	And fame in time to come canonize us;	999
	For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose	999
	So rich advantage of a promised glory	999
	As smiles upon the forehead of this action	999
	For the wide world's revenue.	999
	999
HECTOR	I am yours,	999
	You valiant offspring of great Priamus.	999
	I have a roisting challenge sent amongst	999
	The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks	999
	Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:	999
	I was advertised their great general slept,	999
	Whilst emulation in the army crept:	999
	This, I presume, will wake him.	999

	[Enter THERSITES, solus]	999
	999
THERSITES	How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of	999
	thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He	999
	beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!	999
	would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,	999
	whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to	999
	conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of	999
	my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a	999
	rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two	999
	undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of	999
	themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,	999
	forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,	999
	Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy	999
	caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less	999
	than little wit from them that they have! which	999
	short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant	999
	scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly	999
	from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and	999
	cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the	999
	whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,	999
	methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war	999
	for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy	999
	say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!	999
	999
	[Enter PATROCLUS]	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.	999
	999
THERSITES	If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou	999
	wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but	999
	it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common	999
	curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in	999
	great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and	999
	discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy	999
	direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee	999
	out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and	999
	sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.	999
	Amen. Where's Achilles?	999
	999
PATROCLUS	What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?	999
	999
THERSITES	Ay: the heavens hear me!	999
	999
	[Enter ACHILLES]	999
	999
ACHILLES	Who's there?	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Thersites, my lord.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, my	999
	digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to	999
	my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?	999
	999
THERSITES	Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,	999
	what's Achilles?	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,	999
	what's thyself?	999
	999
THERSITES	Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,	999
	what art thou?	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Thou mayst tell that knowest.	999
	999
ACHILLES	O, tell, tell.	999
	999
THERSITES	I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands	999
	Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'	999
	knower, and Patroclus is a fool.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	You rascal!	999
	999
THERSITES	Peace, fool! I have not done.	999
	999
ACHILLES	He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.	999
	999
THERSITES	Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites	999
	is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Derive this; come.	999
	999
THERSITES	Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;	999
	Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;	999
	Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and	999
	Patroclus is a fool positive.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Why am I a fool?	999
	999
THERSITES	Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou	999
	art. Look you, who comes here?	999
	999
ACHILLES	Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody.	999
	Come in with me, Thersites.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
THERSITES	Here is such patchery, such juggling and such	999
	knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a	999
	whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions	999
	and bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on	999
	the subject! and war and lechery confound all!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and AJAX]	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Where is Achilles?	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Within his tent; but ill disposed, my lord.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Let it be known to him that we are here.	999
	He shent our messengers; and we lay by	999
	Our appertainments, visiting of him:	999
	Let him be told so; lest perchance he think	999
	We dare not move the question of our place,	999
	Or know not what we are.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	I shall say so to him.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ULYSSES	We saw him at the opening of his tent:	999
	He is not sick.	999
	999
AJAX	Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it	999
	melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my	999
	head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us the	999
	cause. A word, my lord.	999
	999
	[Takes AGAMEMNON aside]	999
	999
NESTOR	What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?	999
	999
ULYSSES	Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.	999
	999
NESTOR	Who, Thersites?	999
	999
ULYSSES	He.	999
	999
NESTOR	Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.	999
	999
ULYSSES	No, you see, he is his argument that has his	999
	argument, Achilles.	999
	999
NESTOR	All the better; their fraction is more our wish than	999
	their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool	999
	could disunite.	999
	999
ULYSSES	The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily	999
	untie. Here comes Patroclus.	999
	999
	[Re-enter PATROCLUS]	999
	999
NESTOR	No Achilles with him.	999
	999
ULYSSES	The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:	999
	his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,	999
	If any thing more than your sport and pleasure	999
	Did move your greatness and this noble state	999
	To call upon him; he hopes it is no other	999
	But for your health and your digestion sake,	999
	And after-dinner's breath.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Hear you, Patroclus:	999
	We are too well acquainted with these answers:	999
	But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,	999
	Cannot outfly our apprehensions.	999
	Much attribute he hath, and much the reason	999
	Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,	999
	Not virtuously on his own part beheld,	999
	Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,	999
	Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,	999
	Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,	999
	We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,	999
	If you do say we think him over-proud	999
	And under-honest, in self-assumption greater	999
	Than in the note of judgment; and worthier	999
	than himself	999
	Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,	999
	Disguise the holy strength of their command,	999
	And underwrite in an observing kind	999
	His humorous predominance; yea, watch	999
	His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if	999
	The passage and whole carriage of this action	999
	Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,	999
	That if he overhold his price so much,	999
	We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine	999
	Not portable, lie under this report:	999
	'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:	999
	A stirring dwarf we do allowance give	999
	Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	I shall; and bring his answer presently.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	In second voice we'll not be satisfied;	999
	We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.	999
	999
	[Exit ULYSSES]	999
	999
AJAX	What is he more than another?	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	No more than what he thinks he is.	999
	999
AJAX	Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a	999
	better man than I am?	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	No question.	999
	999
AJAX	Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as	999
	wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether	999
	more tractable.	999
	999
AJAX	Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I	999
	know not what pride is.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the	999
	fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is	999
	his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;	999
	and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours	999
	the deed in the praise.	999
	999
AJAX	I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.	999
	999
NESTOR	Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	[Re-enter ULYSSES]	999
	999
ULYSSES	Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	What's his excuse?	999
	999
ULYSSES	                  He doth rely on none,	999
	But carries on the stream of his dispose	999
	Without observance or respect of any,	999
	In will peculiar and in self-admission.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Why will he not upon our fair request	999
	Untent his person and share the air with us?	999
	999
ULYSSES	Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,	999
	He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,	999
	And speaks not to himself but with a pride	999
	That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth	999
	Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse	999
	That 'twixt his mental and his active parts	999
	Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages	999
	And batters down himself: what should I say?	999
	He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it	999
	Cry 'No recovery.'	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	                  Let Ajax go to him.	999
	Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:	999
	'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led	999
	At your request a little from himself.	999
	999
ULYSSES	O Agamemnon, let it not be so!	999
	We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes	999
	When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord	999
	That bastes his arrogance with his own seam	999
	And never suffers matter of the world	999
	Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve	999
	And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd	999
	Of that we hold an idol more than he?	999
	No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord	999
	Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;	999
	Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,	999
	As amply titled as Achilles is,	999
	By going to Achilles:	999
	That were to enlard his fat already pride	999
	And add more coals to Cancer when he burns	999
	With entertaining great Hyperion.	999
	This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,	999
	And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'	999
	999
NESTOR	[Aside to DIOMEDES]  O, this is well; he rubs the	999
	vein of him.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	[Aside to NESTOR]  And how his silence drinks up	999
	this applause!	999
	999
AJAX	If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	O, no, you shall not go.	999
	999
AJAX	An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:	999
	Let me go to him.	999
	999
ULYSSES	Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.	999
	999
AJAX	A paltry, insolent fellow!	999
	999
NESTOR	How he describes himself!	999
	999
AJAX	Can he not be sociable?	999
	999
ULYSSES	The raven chides blackness.	999
	999
AJAX	I'll let his humours blood.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	He will be the physician that should be the patient.	999
	999
AJAX	An all men were o' my mind,--	999
	999
ULYSSES	Wit would be out of fashion.	999
	999
AJAX	A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:	999
	shall pride carry it?	999
	999
NESTOR	An 'twould, you'ld carry half.	999
	999
ULYSSES	A' would have ten shares.	999
	999
AJAX	I will knead him; I'll make him supple.	999
	999
NESTOR	He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:	999
	pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.	999
	999
ULYSSES	[To AGAMEMNON]  My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.	999
	999
NESTOR	Our noble general, do not do so.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	You must prepare to fight without Achilles.	999
	999
ULYSSES	Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.	999
	Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;	999
	I will be silent.	999
	999
NESTOR	                  Wherefore should you so?	999
	He is not emulous, as Achilles is.	999
	999
ULYSSES	Know the whole world, he is as valiant.	999
	999
AJAX	A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!	999
	Would he were a Trojan!	999
	999
NESTOR	What a vice were it in Ajax now,--	999
	999
ULYSSES	If he were proud,--	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Or covetous of praise,--	999
	999
ULYSSES	Ay, or surly borne,--	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Or strange, or self-affected!	999
	999
ULYSSES	Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;	999
	Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:	999
	Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature	999
	Thrice famed, beyond all erudition:	999
	But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,	999
	Let Mars divide eternity in twain,	999
	And give him half: and, for thy vigour,	999
	Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield	999
	To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,	999
	Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines	999
	Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;	999
	Instructed by the antiquary times,	999
	He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:	999
	Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days	999
	As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,	999
	You should not have the eminence of him,	999
	But be as Ajax.	999
	999
AJAX	                  Shall I call you father?	999
	999
NESTOR	Ay, my good son.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	                  Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.	999
	999
ULYSSES	There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles	999
	Keeps thicket. Please it our great general	999
	To call together all his state of war;	999
	Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow	999
	We must with all our main of power stand fast:	999
	And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,	999
	And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:	999
	Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.	999

	999
SCENE I	Troy. Priam's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant and PANDARUS]	999
	999
PANDARUS	Friend, you! pray you, a word: do not you follow	999
	the young Lord Paris?	999
	999
Servant	Ay, sir, when he goes before me.	999
	999
PANDARUS	You depend upon him, I mean?	999
	999
Servant	Sir, I do depend upon the lord.	999
	999
PANDARUS	You depend upon a noble gentleman; I must needs	999
	praise him.	999
	999
Servant	The lord be praised!	999
	999
PANDARUS	You know me, do you not?	999
	999
Servant	Faith, sir, superficially.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Friend, know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.	999
	999
Servant	I hope I shall know your honour better.	999
	999
PANDARUS	I do desire it.	999
	999
Servant	You are in the state of grace.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Grace! not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles.	999
	999
	[Music within]	999
	999
	What music is this?	999
	999
Servant	I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Know you the musicians?	999
	999
Servant	Wholly, sir.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Who play they to?	999
	999
Servant	To the hearers, sir.	999
	999
PANDARUS	At whose pleasure, friend	999
	999
Servant	At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Command, I mean, friend.	999
	999
Servant	Who shall I command, sir?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Friend, we understand not one another: I am too	999
	courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose request	999
	do these men play?	999
	999
Servant	That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request	999
	of Paris my lord, who's there in person; with him,	999
	the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's	999
	invisible soul,--	999
	999
PANDARUS	Who, my cousin Cressida?	999
	999
Servant	No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her	999
	attributes?	999
	999
PANDARUS	It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the	999
	Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the	999
	Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault	999
	upon him, for my business seethes.	999
	999
Servant	Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!	999
	999
	[Enter PARIS and HELEN, attended]	999
	999
PANDARUS	Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair	999
	company! fair desires, in all fair measure,	999
	fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen!	999
	fair thoughts be your fair pillow!	999
	999
HELEN	Dear lord, you are full of fair words.	999
	999
PANDARUS	You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair	999
	prince, here is good broken music.	999
	999
PARIS	You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you	999
	shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out	999
	with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full	999
	of harmony.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Truly, lady, no.	999
	999
HELEN	O, sir,--	999
	999
PANDARUS	Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.	999
	999
PARIS	Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.	999
	999
PANDARUS	I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord,	999
	will you vouchsafe me a word?	999
	999
HELEN	Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you	999
	sing, certainly.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,	999
	marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed	999
	friend, your brother Troilus,--	999
	999
HELEN	My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,--	999
	999
PANDARUS	Go to, sweet queen, to go:--commends himself most	999
	affectionately to you,--	999
	999
HELEN	You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,	999
	our melancholy upon your head!	999
	999
PANDARUS	Sweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith.	999
	999
HELEN	And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall not,	999
	in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no,	999
	no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king	999
	call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.	999
	999
HELEN	My Lord Pandarus,--	999
	999
PANDARUS	What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?	999
	999
PARIS	What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?	999
	999
HELEN	Nay, but, my lord,--	999
	999
PANDARUS	What says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall out	999
	with you. You must not know where he sups.	999
	999
PARIS	I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.	999
	999
PANDARUS	No, no, no such matter; you are wide: come, your	999
	disposer is sick.	999
	999
PARIS	Well, I'll make excuse.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? no,	999
	your poor disposer's sick.	999
	999
PARIS	I spy.	999
	999
PANDARUS	You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an	999
	instrument. Now, sweet queen.	999
	999
HELEN	Why, this is kindly done.	999
	999
PANDARUS	My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,	999
	sweet queen.	999
	999
HELEN	She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.	999
	999
PANDARUS	He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.	999
	999
HELEN	Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing	999
	you a song now.	999
	999
HELEN	Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou	999
	hast a fine forehead.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Ay, you may, you may.	999
	999
HELEN	Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.	999
	O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!	999
	999
PANDARUS	Love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.	999
	999
PARIS	Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.	999
	999
PANDARUS	In good troth, it begins so.	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	Love, love, nothing but love, still more!	999
	For, O, love's bow	999
	Shoots buck and doe:	999
	The shaft confounds,	999
	Not that it wounds,	999
	But tickles still the sore.	999
	These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!	999
	Yet that which seems the wound to kill,	999
	Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!	999
	So dying love lives still:	999
	Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha!	999
	Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!	999
	Heigh-ho!	999
	999
HELEN	In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.	999
	999
PARIS	He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot	999
	blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot	999
	thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Is this the generation of love? hot blood, hot	999
	thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers:	999
	is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's	999
	a-field to-day?	999
	999
PARIS	Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the	999
	gallantry of Troy: I  would fain have armed to-day,	999
	but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my	999
	brother Troilus went not?	999
	999
HELEN	He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord Pandarus.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they	999
	sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?	999
	999
PARIS	To a hair.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Farewell, sweet queen.	999
	999
HELEN	Commend me to your niece.	999
	999
PANDARUS	I will, sweet queen.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[A retreat sounded]	999
	999
PARIS	They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,	999
	To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you	999
	To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,	999
	With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,	999
	Shall more obey than to the edge of steel	999
	Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more	999
	Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector.	999
	999
HELEN	'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;	999
	Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty	999
	Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,	999
	Yea, overshines ourself.	999
	999
PARIS	Sweet, above thought I love thee.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	The same. Pandarus' orchard.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PANDARUS and Troilus's Boy, meeting]	999
	999
PANDARUS	How now! where's thy master? at my cousin	999
	Cressida's?	999
	999
Boy	No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.	999
	999
PANDARUS	O, here he comes.	999
	999
	[Enter TROILUS]	999
	999
	How now, how now!	999
	999
TROILUS	Sirrah, walk off.	999
	999
	[Exit Boy]	999
	999
PANDARUS	Have you seen my cousin?	999
	999
TROILUS	No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,	999
	Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks	999
	Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,	999
	And give me swift transportance to those fields	999
	Where I may wallow in the lily-beds	999
	Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,	999
	From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings	999
	And fly with me to Cressid!	999
	999
PANDARUS	Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
TROILUS	I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.	999
	The imaginary relish is so sweet	999
	That it enchants my sense: what will it be,	999
	When that the watery palate tastes indeed	999
	Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,	999
	Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,	999
	Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,	999
	For the capacity of my ruder powers:	999
	I fear it much; and I do fear besides,	999
	That I shall lose distinction in my joys;	999
	As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps	999
	The enemy flying.	999
	999
	[Re-enter PANDARUS]	999
	999
PANDARUS	She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you	999
	must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches	999
	her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a	999
	sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest	999
	villain: she fetches her breath as short as a	999
	new-ta'en sparrow.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
TROILUS	Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:	999
	My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;	999
	And all my powers do their bestowing lose,	999
	Like vassalage at unawares encountering	999
	The eye of majesty.	999
	999
	[Re-enter PANDARUS with CRESSIDA]	999
	999
PANDARUS	Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.	999
	Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that	999
	you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?	999
	you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?	999
	Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward,	999
	we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to	999
	her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your	999
	picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend	999
	daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.	999
	So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!	999
	a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the air	999
	is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere	999
	I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the	999
	ducks i' the river: go to, go to.	999
	999
TROILUS	You have bereft me of all words, lady.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll	999
	bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your	999
	activity in question. What, billing again? Here's	999
	'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--	999
	Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Will you walk in, my lord?	999
	999
TROILUS	O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!	999
	999
TROILUS	What should they grant? what makes this pretty	999
	abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet	999
	lady in the fountain of our love?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.	999
	999
TROILUS	Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer	999
	footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to	999
	fear the worst oft cures the worse.	999
	999
TROILUS	O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's	999
	pageant there is presented no monster.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Nor nothing monstrous neither?	999
	999
TROILUS	Nothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weep	999
	seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking	999
	it harder for our mistress to devise imposition	999
	enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.	999
	This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will	999
	is infinite and the execution confined, that the	999
	desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	They say all lovers swear more performance than they	999
	are able and yet reserve an ability that they never	999
	perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and	999
	discharging less than the tenth part of one. They	999
	that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,	999
	are they not monsters?	999
	999
TROILUS	Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we	999
	are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go	999
	bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion	999
	shall have a praise in present: we will not name	999
	desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition	999
	shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus	999
	shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst	999
	shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can	999
	speak truest not truer than Troilus.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Will you walk in, my lord?	999
	999
	[Re-enter PANDARUS]	999
	999
PANDARUS	What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.	999
	999
PANDARUS	I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,	999
	you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he	999
	flinch, chide me for it.	999
	999
TROILUS	You know now your hostages; your uncle's word and my	999
	firm faith.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,	999
	though they be long ere they are wooed, they are	999
	constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;	999
	they'll stick where they are thrown.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.	999
	Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day	999
	For many weary months.	999
	999
TROILUS	Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,	999
	With the first glance that ever--pardon me--	999
	If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.	999
	I love you now; but not, till now, so much	999
	But I might master it: in faith, I lie;	999
	My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown	999
	Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!	999
	Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,	999
	When we are so unsecret to ourselves?	999
	But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;	999
	And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,	999
	Or that we women had men's privilege	999
	Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,	999
	For in this rapture I shall surely speak	999
	The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,	999
	Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws	999
	My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.	999
	999
TROILUS	And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Pretty, i' faith.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;	999
	'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:	999
	I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?	999
	For this time will I take my leave, my lord.	999
	999
TROILUS	Your leave, sweet Cressid!	999
	999
PANDARUS	Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Pray you, content you.	999
	999
TROILUS	What offends you, lady?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Sir, mine own company.	999
	999
TROILUS	You cannot shun Yourself.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	        Let me go and try:	999
	I have a kind of self resides with you;	999
	But an unkind self, that itself will leave,	999
	To be another's fool. I would be gone:	999
	Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.	999
	999
TROILUS	Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;	999
	And fell so roundly to a large confession,	999
	To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,	999
	Or else you love not, for to be wise and love	999
	Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.	999
	999
TROILUS	O that I thought it could be in a woman--	999
	As, if it can, I will presume in you--	999
	To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;	999
	To keep her constancy in plight and youth,	999
	Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind	999
	That doth renew swifter than blood decays!	999
	Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,	999
	That my integrity and truth to you	999
	Might be affronted with the match and weight	999
	Of such a winnow'd purity in love;	999
	How were I then uplifted! but, alas!	999
	I am as true as truth's simplicity	999
	And simpler than the infancy of truth.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	In that I'll war with you.	999
	999
TROILUS	O virtuous fight,	999
	When right with right wars who shall be most right!	999
	True swains in love shall in the world to come	999
	Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,	999
	Full of protest, of oath and big compare,	999
	Want similes, truth tired with iteration,	999
	As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,	999
	As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,	999
	As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,	999
	Yet, after all comparisons of truth,	999
	As truth's authentic author to be cited,	999
	'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,	999
	And sanctify the numbers.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Prophet may you be!	999
	If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,	999
	When time is old and hath forgot itself,	999
	When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,	999
	And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,	999
	And mighty states characterless are grated	999
	To dusty nothing, yet let memory,	999
	From false to false, among false maids in love,	999
	Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false	999
	As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,	999
	As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,	999
	Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'	999
	'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,	999
	'As false as Cressid.'	999
	999
PANDARUS	Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the	999
	witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.	999
	If ever you prove false one to another, since I have	999
	taken such pains to bring you together, let all	999
	pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end	999
	after my name; call them all Pandars; let all	999
	constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,	999
	and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.	999
	999
TROILUS	Amen.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Amen.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a	999
	bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your	999
	pretty encounters, press it to death: away!	999
	And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here	999
	Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!	999
	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX,	999
	MENELAUS, and CALCHAS]	999
	999
CALCHAS	Now, princes, for the service I have done you,	999
	The advantage of the time prompts me aloud	999
	To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind	999
	That, through the sight I bear in things to love,	999
	I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,	999
	Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,	999
	From certain and possess'd conveniences,	999
	To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all	999
	That time, acquaintance, custom and condition	999
	Made tame and most familiar to my nature,	999
	And here, to do you service, am become	999
	As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:	999
	I do beseech you, as in way of taste,	999
	To give me now a little benefit,	999
	Out of those many register'd in promise,	999
	Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.	999
	999
CALCHAS	You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,	999
	Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.	999
	Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--	999
	Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,	999
	Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,	999
	I know, is such a wrest in their affairs	999
	That their negotiations all must slack,	999
	Wanting his manage; and they will almost	999
	Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,	999
	In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,	999
	And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence	999
	Shall quite strike off all service I have done,	999
	In most accepted pain.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Let Diomedes bear him,	999
	And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have	999
	What he requests of us. Good Diomed,	999
	Furnish you fairly for this interchange:	999
	Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow	999
	Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden	999
	Which I am proud to bear.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS]	999
	999
	[Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent]	999
	999
ULYSSES	Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:	999
	Please it our general to pass strangely by him,	999
	As if he were forgot; and, princes all,	999
	Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:	999
	I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me	999
	Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:	999
	If so, I have derision medicinable,	999
	To use between your strangeness and his pride,	999
	Which his own will shall have desire to drink:	999
	It may be good: pride hath no other glass	999
	To show itself but pride, for supple knees	999
	Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	We'll execute your purpose, and put on	999
	A form of strangeness as we pass along:	999
	So do each lord, and either greet him not,	999
	Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more	999
	Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.	999
	999
ACHILLES	What, comes the general to speak with me?	999
	You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	What says Achilles? would he aught with us?	999
	999
NESTOR	Would you, my lord, aught with the general?	999
	999
ACHILLES	No.	999
	999
NESTOR	Nothing, my lord.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	The better.	999
	999
	[Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR]	999
	999
ACHILLES	Good day, good day.	999
	999
MENELAUS	How do you? how do you?	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ACHILLES	What, does the cuckold scorn me?	999
	999
AJAX	How now, Patroclus!	999
	999
ACHILLES	Good morrow, Ajax.	999
	999
AJAX	Ha?	999
	999
ACHILLES	Good morrow.	999
	999
AJAX	Ay, and good next day too.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ACHILLES	What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?	999
	999
PATROCLUS	They pass by strangely: they were used to bend	999
	To send their smiles before them to Achilles;	999
	To come as humbly as they used to creep	999
	To holy altars.	999
	999
ACHILLES	                  What, am I poor of late?	999
	'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,	999
	Must fall out with men too: what the declined is	999
	He shall as soon read in the eyes of others	999
	As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,	999
	Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,	999
	And not a man, for being simply man,	999
	Hath any honour, but honour for those honours	999
	That are without him, as place, riches, favour,	999
	Prizes of accident as oft as merit:	999
	Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,	999
	The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,	999
	Do one pluck down another and together	999
	Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:	999
	Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy	999
	At ample point all that I did possess,	999
	Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out	999
	Something not worth in me such rich beholding	999
	As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;	999
	I'll interrupt his reading.	999
	How now Ulysses!	999
	999
ULYSSES	                  Now, great Thetis' son!	999
	999
ACHILLES	What are you reading?	999
	999
ULYSSES	A strange fellow here	999
	Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,	999
	How much in having, or without or in,	999
	Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,	999
	Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;	999
	As when his virtues shining upon others	999
	Heat them and they retort that heat again	999
	To the first giver.'	999
	999
ACHILLES	This is not strange, Ulysses.	999
	The beauty that is borne here in the face	999
	The bearer knows not, but commends itself	999
	To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,	999
	That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,	999
	Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed	999
	Salutes each other with each other's form;	999
	For speculation turns not to itself,	999
	Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there	999
	Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.	999
	999
ULYSSES	I do not strain at the position,--	999
	It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;	999
	Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves	999
	That no man is the lord of any thing,	999
	Though in and of him there be much consisting,	999
	Till he communicate his parts to others:	999
	Nor doth he of himself know them for aught	999
	Till he behold them form'd in the applause	999
	Where they're extended; who, like an arch,	999
	reverberates	999
	The voice again, or, like a gate of steel	999
	Fronting the sun, receives and renders back	999
	His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;	999
	And apprehended here immediately	999
	The unknown Ajax.	999
	Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,	999
	That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are	999
	Most abject in regard and dear in use!	999
	What things again most dear in the esteem	999
	And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--	999
	An act that very chance doth throw upon him--	999
	Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,	999
	While some men leave to do!	999
	How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,	999
	Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!	999
	How one man eats into another's pride,	999
	While pride is fasting in his wantonness!	999
	To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already	999
	They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,	999
	As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast	999
	And great Troy shrieking.	999
	999
ACHILLES	I do believe it; for they pass'd by me	999
	As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me	999
	Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?	999
	999
ULYSSES	Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,	999
	Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,	999
	A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:	999
	Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd	999
	As fast as they are made, forgot as soon	999
	As done: perseverance, dear my lord,	999
	Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang	999
	Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail	999
	In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;	999
	For honour travels in a strait so narrow,	999
	Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;	999
	For emulation hath a thousand sons	999
	That one by one pursue: if you give way,	999
	Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,	999
	Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by	999
	And leave you hindmost;	999
	Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,	999
	Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,	999
	O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,	999
	Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;	999
	For time is like a fashionable host	999
	That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,	999
	And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,	999
	Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,	999
	And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not	999
	virtue seek	999
	Remuneration for the thing it was;	999
	For beauty, wit,	999
	High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,	999
	Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all	999
	To envious and calumniating time.	999
	One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,	999
	That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,	999
	Though they are made and moulded of things past,	999
	And give to dust that is a little gilt	999
	More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.	999
	The present eye praises the present object.	999
	Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,	999
	That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;	999
	Since things in motion sooner catch the eye	999
	Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,	999
	And still it might, and yet it may again,	999
	If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive	999
	And case thy reputation in thy tent;	999
	Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,	999
	Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves	999
	And drave great Mars to faction.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Of this my privacy	999
	I have strong reasons.	999
	999
ULYSSES	But 'gainst your privacy	999
	The reasons are more potent and heroical:	999
	'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love	999
	With one of Priam's daughters.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Ha! known!	999
	999
ULYSSES	Is that a wonder?	999
	The providence that's in a watchful state	999
	Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,	999
	Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,	999
	Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,	999
	Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.	999
	There is a mystery--with whom relation	999
	Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;	999
	Which hath an operation more divine	999
	Than breath or pen can give expressure to:	999
	All the commerce that you have had with Troy	999
	As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;	999
	And better would it fit Achilles much	999
	To throw down Hector than Polyxena:	999
	But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,	999
	When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,	999
	And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,	999
	'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,	999
	But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'	999
	Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;	999
	The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PATROCLUS	To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:	999
	A woman impudent and mannish grown	999
	Is not more loathed than an effeminate man	999
	In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;	999
	They think my little stomach to the war	999
	And your great love to me restrains you thus:	999
	Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid	999
	Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,	999
	And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,	999
	Be shook to air.	999
	999
ACHILLES	                  Shall Ajax fight with Hector?	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.	999
	999
ACHILLES	I see my reputation is at stake	999
	My fame is shrewdly gored.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	O, then, beware;	999
	Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:	999
	Omission to do what is necessary	999
	Seals a commission to a blank of danger;	999
	And danger, like an ague, subtly taints	999
	Even then when we sit idly in the sun.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:	999
	I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him	999
	To invite the Trojan lords after the combat	999
	To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,	999
	An appetite that I am sick withal,	999
	To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,	999
	To talk with him and to behold his visage,	999
	Even to my full of view.	999
	999
	[Enter THERSITES]	999
	999
		   A labour saved!	999
	999
THERSITES	A wonder!	999
	999
ACHILLES	What?	999
	999
THERSITES	Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.	999
	999
ACHILLES	How so?	999
	999
THERSITES	He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so	999
	prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he	999
	raves in saying nothing.	999
	999
ACHILLES	How can that be?	999
	999
THERSITES	Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride	999
	and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no	999
	arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:	999
	bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should	999
	say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'	999
	and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire	999
	in a flint, which will not show without knocking.	999
	The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his	999
	neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in	999
	vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,	999
	Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think	999
	you of this man that takes me for the general? He's	999
	grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.	999
	A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both	999
	sides, like a leather jerkin.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.	999
	999
THERSITES	Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not	999
	answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his	999
	tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let	999
	Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the	999
	pageant of Ajax.	999
	999
ACHILLES	To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the	999
	valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector	999
	to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure	999
	safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous	999
	and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured	999
	captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,	999
	et cetera. Do this.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Jove bless great Ajax!	999
	999
THERSITES	Hum!	999
	999
PATROCLUS	I come from the worthy Achilles,--	999
	999
THERSITES	Ha!	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--	999
	999
THERSITES	Hum!	999
	999
PATROCLUS	And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.	999
	999
THERSITES	Agamemnon!	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Ay, my lord.	999
	999
THERSITES	Ha!	999
	999
PATROCLUS	What say you to't?	999
	999
THERSITES	God b' wi' you, with all my heart.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Your answer, sir.	999
	999
THERSITES	If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will	999
	go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me	999
	ere he has me.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Your answer, sir.	999
	999
THERSITES	Fare you well, with all my heart.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?	999
	999
THERSITES	No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in	999
	him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know	999
	not; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo	999
	get his sinews to make catlings on.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.	999
	999
THERSITES	Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the more	999
	capable creature.	999
	999
ACHILLES	My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;	999
	And I myself see not the bottom of it.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS]	999
	999
THERSITES	Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,	999
	that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a	999
	tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Troy. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter, from one side, AENEAS, and Servant with a	999
	torch; from the other, PARIS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR,	999
	DIOMEDES, and others, with torches]	999
	999
PARIS	See, ho! who is that there?	999
	999
DEIPHOBUS	It is the Lord AEneas.	999
	999
AENEAS	Is the prince there in person?	999
	Had I so good occasion to lie long	999
	As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business	999
	Should rob my bed-mate of my company.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.	999
	999
PARIS	A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--	999
	Witness the process of your speech, wherein	999
	You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,	999
	Did haunt you in the field.	999
	999
AENEAS	Health to you, valiant sir,	999
	During all question of the gentle truce;	999
	But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance	999
	As heart can think or courage execute.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	The one and other Diomed embraces.	999
	Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!	999
	But when contention and occasion meet,	999
	By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life	999
	With all my force, pursuit and policy.	999
	999
AENEAS	And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly	999
	With his face backward. In humane gentleness,	999
	Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,	999
	Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,	999
	No man alive can love in such a sort	999
	The thing he means to kill more excellently.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,	999
	If to my sword his fate be not the glory,	999
	A thousand complete courses of the sun!	999
	But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,	999
	With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!	999
	999
AENEAS	We know each other well.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	We do; and long to know each other worse.	999
	999
PARIS	This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,	999
	The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.	999
	What business, lord, so early?	999
	999
AENEAS	I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.	999
	999
PARIS	His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek	999
	To Calchas' house, and there to render him,	999
	For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:	999
	Let's have your company, or, if you please,	999
	Haste there before us: I constantly do think--	999
	Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--	999
	My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:	999
	Rouse him and give him note of our approach.	999
	With the whole quality wherefore: I fear	999
	We shall be much unwelcome.	999
	999
AENEAS	That I assure you:	999
	Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece	999
	Than Cressid borne from Troy.	999
	999
PARIS	There is no help;	999
	The bitter disposition of the time	999
	Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.	999
	999
AENEAS	Good morrow, all.	999
	999
	[Exit with Servant]	999
	999
PARIS	And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,	999
	Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,	999
	Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,	999
	Myself or Menelaus?	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Both alike:	999
	He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,	999
	Not making any scruple of her soilure,	999
	With such a hell of pain and world of charge,	999
	And you as well to keep her, that defend her,	999
	Not palating the taste of her dishonour,	999
	With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:	999
	He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up	999
	The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;	999
	You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins	999
	Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:	999
	Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;	999
	But he as he, the heavier for a whore.	999
	999
PARIS	You are too bitter to your countrywoman.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:	999
	For every false drop in her bawdy veins	999
	A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple	999
	Of her contaminated carrion weight,	999
	A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,	999
	She hath not given so many good words breath	999
	As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.	999
	999
PARIS	Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,	999
	Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:	999
	But we in silence hold this virtue well,	999
	We'll but commend what we intend to sell.	999
	Here lies our way.	999

SCENE II	The same. Court of Pandarus' house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA]	999
	999
TROILUS	Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;	999
	He shall unbolt the gates.	999
	999
TROILUS	Trouble him not;	999
	To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,	999
	And give as soft attachment to thy senses	999
	As infants' empty of all thought!	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Good morrow, then.	999
	999
TROILUS	I prithee now, to bed.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Are you a-weary of me?	999
	999
TROILUS	O Cressida! but that the busy day,	999
	Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,	999
	And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,	999
	I would not from thee.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Night hath been too brief.	999
	999
TROILUS	Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays	999
	As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love	999
	With wings more momentary-swift than thought.	999
	You will catch cold, and curse me.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Prithee, tarry:	999
	You men will never tarry.	999
	O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,	999
	And then you would have tarried. Hark!	999
	there's one up.	999
	999
PANDARUS	[Within]  What, 's all the doors open here?	999
	999
TROILUS	It is your uncle.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:	999
	I shall have such a life!	999
	999
	[Enter PANDARUS]	999
	999
PANDARUS	How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, you	999
	maid! where's my cousin Cressid?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!	999
	You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.	999
	999
PANDARUS	To do what? to do what? let her say	999
	what: what have I brought you to do?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,	999
	Nor suffer others.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!	999
	hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty	999
	man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	999
	Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.	999
	My lord, come you again into my chamber:	999
	You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.	999
	999
TROILUS	Ha, ha!	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	999
	How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:	999
	I would not for half Troy have you seen here.	999
	999
	[Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA]	999
	999
PANDARUS	Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat	999
	down the door? How now! what's the matter?	999
	999
	[Enter AENEAS]	999
	999
AENEAS	Good morrow, lord, good morrow.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,	999
	I knew you not: what news with you so early?	999
	999
AENEAS	Is not Prince Troilus here?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Here! what should he do here?	999
	999
AENEAS	Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:	999
	It doth import him much to speak with me.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll	999
	be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What	999
	should he do here?	999
	999
AENEAS	Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong	999
	ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be	999
	false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go	999
	fetch him hither; go.	999
	999
	[Re-enter TROILUS]	999
	999
TROILUS	How now! what's the matter?	999
	999
AENEAS	My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,	999
	My matter is so rash: there is at hand	999
	Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,	999
	The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor	999
	Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,	999
	Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,	999
	We must give up to Diomedes' hand	999
	The Lady Cressida.	999
	999
TROILUS	                  Is it so concluded?	999
	999
AENEAS	By Priam and the general state of Troy:	999
	They are at hand and ready to effect it.	999
	999
TROILUS	How my achievements mock me!	999
	I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,	999
	We met by chance; you did not find me here.	999
	999
AENEAS	Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature	999
	Have not more gift in taciturnity.	999
	999
	[Exeunt TROILUS and AENEAS]	999
	999
PANDARUS	Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil	999
	take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a	999
	plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!	999
	999
	[Re-enter CRESSIDA]	999
	999
CRESSIDA	How now! what's the matter? who was here?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Ah, ah!	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!	999
	Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!	999
	999
CRESSIDA	O the gods! what's the matter?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been	999
	born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor	999
	gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,	999
	what's the matter?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou	999
	art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,	999
	and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;	999
	'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	O you immortal gods! I will not go.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Thou must.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;	999
	I know no touch of consanguinity;	999
	No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me	999
	As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!	999
	Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,	999
	If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,	999
	Do to this body what extremes you can;	999
	But the strong base and building of my love	999
	Is as the very centre of the earth,	999
	Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--	999
	999
PANDARUS	Do, do.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,	999
	Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart	999
	With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.	999

	999
	[Enter PARIS, TROILUS, AENEAS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR,	999
	and DIOMEDES]	999
	999
PARIS	It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd	999
	Of her delivery to this valiant Greek	999
	Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,	999
	Tell you the lady what she is to do,	999
	And haste her to the purpose.	999
	999
TROILUS	Walk into her house;	999
	I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:	999
	And to his hand when I deliver her,	999
	Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus	999
	A priest there offering to it his own heart.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PARIS	I know what 'tis to love;	999
	And would, as I shall pity, I could help!	999
	Please you walk in, my lords.	999

SCENE IV	The same. Pandarus' house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PANDARUS and CRESSIDA]	999
	999
PANDARUS	Be moderate, be moderate.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Why tell you me of moderation?	999
	The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,	999
	And violenteth in a sense as strong	999
	As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?	999
	If I could temporize with my affection,	999
	Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,	999
	The like allayment could I give my grief.	999
	My love admits no qualifying dross;	999
	No more my grief, in such a precious loss.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Here, here, here he comes.	999
	999
	[Enter TROILUS]	999
	999
	Ah, sweet ducks!	999
	999
CRESSIDA	O Troilus! Troilus!	999
	999
	[Embracing him]	999
	999
PANDARUS	What a pair of spectacles is here!	999
	Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,	999
	'--O heart, heavy heart,	999
	Why sigh'st thou without breaking?	999
	where he answers again,	999
	'Because thou canst not ease thy smart	999
	By friendship nor by speaking.'	999
	There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away	999
	nothing, for we may live to have need of such a	999
	verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?	999
	999
TROILUS	Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,	999
	That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,	999
	More bright in zeal than the devotion which	999
	Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Have the gods envy?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	And is it true that I must go from Troy?	999
	999
TROILUS	A hateful truth.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	                  What, and from Troilus too?	999
	999
TROILUS	From Troy and Troilus.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Is it possible?	999
	999
TROILUS	And suddenly; where injury of chance	999
	Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by	999
	All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips	999
	Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents	999
	Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows	999
	Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:	999
	We two, that with so many thousand sighs	999
	Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves	999
	With the rude brevity and discharge of one.	999
	Injurious time now with a robber's haste	999
	Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:	999
	As many farewells as be stars in heaven,	999
	With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,	999
	He fumbles up into a lose adieu,	999
	And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,	999
	Distasted with the salt of broken tears.	999
	999
AENEAS	[Within]  My lord, is the lady ready?	999
	999
TROILUS	Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so	999
	Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.	999
	Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.	999
	999
PANDARUS	Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or	999
	my heart will be blown up by the root.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CRESSIDA	I must then to the Grecians?	999
	999
TROILUS	No remedy.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!	999
	When shall we see again?	999
	999
TROILUS	Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--	999
	999
CRESSIDA	I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?	999
	999
TROILUS	Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,	999
	For it is parting from us:	999
	I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,	999
	For I will throw my glove to Death himself,	999
	That there's no maculation in thy heart:	999
	But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in	999
	My sequent protestation; be thou true,	999
	And I will see thee.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers	999
	As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.	999
	999
TROILUS	And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	And you this glove. When shall I see you?	999
	999
TROILUS	I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,	999
	To give thee nightly visitation.	999
	But yet be true.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	                  O heavens! 'be true' again!	999
	999
TROILUS	Hear while I speak it, love:	999
	The Grecian youths are full of quality;	999
	They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,	999
	Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:	999
	How novelty may move, and parts with person,	999
	Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--	999
	Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--	999
	Makes me afeard.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	                  O heavens! you love me not.	999
	999
TROILUS	Die I a villain, then!	999
	In this I do not call your faith in question	999
	So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,	999
	Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,	999
	Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,	999
	To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:	999
	But I can tell that in each grace of these	999
	There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil	999
	That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Do you think I will?	999
	999
TROILUS	No.	999
	But something may be done that we will not:	999
	And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,	999
	When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,	999
	Presuming on their changeful potency.	999
	999
AENEAS	[Within]  Nay, good my lord,--	999
	999
TROILUS	Come, kiss; and let us part.	999
	999
PARIS	[Within]  Brother Troilus!	999
	999
TROILUS	Good brother, come you hither;	999
	And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	My lord, will you be true?	999
	999
TROILUS	Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:	999
	Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,	999
	I with great truth catch mere simplicity;	999
	Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,	999
	With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.	999
	Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit	999
	Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.	999
	999
	[Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS,	999
	and DIOMEDES]	999
	999
	Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady	999
	Which for Antenor we deliver you:	999
	At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,	999
	And by the way possess thee what she is.	999
	Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,	999
	If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,	999
	Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe	999
	As Priam is in Ilion.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Fair Lady Cressid,	999
	So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:	999
	The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,	999
	Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed	999
	You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.	999
	999
TROILUS	Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,	999
	To shame the zeal of my petition to thee	999
	In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,	999
	She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises	999
	As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.	999
	I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;	999
	For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,	999
	Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,	999
	I'll cut thy throat.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:	999
	Let me be privileged by my place and message,	999
	To be a speaker free; when I am hence	999
	I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,	999
	I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth	999
	She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,'	999
	I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'	999
	999
TROILUS	Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,	999
	This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.	999
	Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,	999
	To our own selves bend we our needful talk.	999
	999
	[Exeunt TROILUS, CRESSIDA, and DIOMEDES]	999
	999
	[Trumpet within]	999
	999
PARIS	Hark! Hector's trumpet.	999
	999
AENEAS	How have we spent this morning!	999
	The prince must think me tardy and remiss,	999
	That sore to ride before him to the field.	999
	999
PARIS	'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.	999
	999
DEIPHOBUS	Let us make ready straight.	999
	999
AENEAS	Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,	999
	Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:	999
	The glory of our Troy doth this day lie	999
	On his fair worth and single chivalry.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter AJAX, armed; AGAMEMNON, ACHILLES, PATROCLUS,	999
	MENELAUS, ULYSSES, NESTOR, and others]	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,	999
	Anticipating time with starting courage.	999
	Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,	999
	Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air	999
	May pierce the head of the great combatant	999
	And hale him hither.	999
	999
AJAX	Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.	999
	Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:	999
	Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek	999
	Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:	999
	Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood;	999
	Thou blow'st for Hector.	999
	999
	[Trumpet sounds]	999
	999
ULYSSES	No trumpet answers.	999
	999
ACHILLES	'Tis but early days.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?	999
	999
ULYSSES	'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait;	999
	He rises on the toe: that spirit of his	999
	In aspiration lifts him from the earth.	999
	999
	[Enter DIOMEDES, with CRESSIDA]	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Is this the Lady Cressid?	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Even she.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.	999
	999
NESTOR	Our general doth salute you with a kiss.	999
	999
ULYSSES	Yet is the kindness but particular;	999
	'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.	999
	999
NESTOR	And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.	999
	So much for Nestor.	999
	999
ACHILLES	I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:	999
	Achilles bids you welcome.	999
	999
MENELAUS	I had good argument for kissing once.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	But that's no argument for kissing now;	999
	For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,	999
	And parted thus you and your argument.	999
	999
ULYSSES	O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!	999
	For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:	999
	Patroclus kisses you.	999
	999
MENELAUS	O, this is trim!	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Paris and I kiss evermore for him.	999
	999
MENELAUS	I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	In kissing, do you render or receive?	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Both take and give.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	I'll make my match to live,	999
	The kiss you take is better than you give;	999
	Therefore no kiss.	999
	999
MENELAUS	I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	You're an odd man; give even or give none.	999
	999
MENELAUS	An odd man, lady! every man is odd.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,	999
	That you are odd, and he is even with you.	999
	999
MENELAUS	You fillip me o' the head.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	No, I'll be sworn.	999
	999
ULYSSES	It were no match, your nail against his horn.	999
	May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	You may.	999
	999
ULYSSES	       I do desire it.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Why, beg, then.	999
	999
ULYSSES	Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,	999
	When Helen is a maid again, and his.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.	999
	999
ULYSSES	Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.	999
	999
	[Exit with CRESSIDA]	999
	999
NESTOR	A woman of quick sense.	999
	999
ULYSSES	Fie, fie upon her!	999
	There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,	999
	Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out	999
	At every joint and motive of her body.	999
	O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,	999
	That give accosting welcome ere it comes,	999
	And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts	999
	To every ticklish reader! set them down	999
	For sluttish spoils of opportunity	999
	And daughters of the game.	999
	999
	[Trumpet within]	999
	999
ALL	The Trojans' trumpet.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Yonder comes the troop.	999
	999
	[Enter HECTOR, armed; AENEAS, TROILUS, and other	999
	Trojans, with Attendants]	999
	999
AENEAS	Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done	999
	To him that victory commands? or do you purpose	999
	A victor shall be known? will you the knights	999
	Shall to the edge of all extremity	999
	Pursue each other, or shall be divided	999
	By any voice or order of the field?	999
	Hector bade ask.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Which way would Hector have it?	999
	999
AENEAS	He cares not; he'll obey conditions.	999
	999
ACHILLES	'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,	999
	A little proudly, and great deal misprizing	999
	The knight opposed.	999
	999
AENEAS	If not Achilles, sir,	999
	What is your name?	999
	999
ACHILLES	                  If not Achilles, nothing.	999
	999
AENEAS	Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:	999
	In the extremity of great and little,	999
	Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;	999
	The one almost as infinite as all,	999
	The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,	999
	And that which looks like pride is courtesy.	999
	This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:	999
	In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;	999
	Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek	999
	This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.	999
	999
ACHILLES	A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.	999
	999
	[Re-enter DIOMEDES]	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,	999
	Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas	999
	Consent upon the order of their fight,	999
	So be it; either to the uttermost,	999
	Or else a breath: the combatants being kin	999
	Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.	999
	999
	[AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists]	999
	999
ULYSSES	They are opposed already.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?	999
	999
ULYSSES	The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,	999
	Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,	999
	Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;	999
	Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:	999
	His heart and hand both open and both free;	999
	For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;	999
	Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,	999
	Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;	999
	Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;	999
	For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes	999
	To tender objects, but he in heat of action	999
	Is more vindicative than jealous love:	999
	They call him Troilus, and on him erect	999
	A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.	999
	Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth	999
	Even to his inches, and with private soul	999
	Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.	999
	999
	[Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight]	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	They are in action.	999
	999
NESTOR	Now, Ajax, hold thine own!	999
	999
TROILUS	Hector, thou sleep'st;	999
	Awake thee!	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!	999
	999
DIOMEDES	You must no more.	999
	999
	[Trumpets cease]	999
	999
AENEAS	                  Princes, enough, so please you.	999
	999
AJAX	I am not warm yet; let us fight again.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	As Hector pleases.	999
	999
HECTOR	                  Why, then will I no more:	999
	Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,	999
	A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;	999
	The obligation of our blood forbids	999
	A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:	999
	Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so	999
	That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,	999
	And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg	999
	All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood	999
	Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister	999
	Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,	999
	Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member	999
	Wherein my sword had not impressure made	999
	Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay	999
	That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,	999
	My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword	999
	Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:	999
	By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;	999
	Hector would have them fall upon him thus:	999
	Cousin, all honour to thee!	999
	999
AJAX	I thank thee, Hector	999
	Thou art too gentle and too free a man:	999
	I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence	999
	A great addition earned in thy death.	999
	999
HECTOR	Not Neoptolemus so mirable,	999
	On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes	999
	Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself	999
	A thought of added honour torn from Hector.	999
	999
AENEAS	There is expectance here from both the sides,	999
	What further you will do.	999
	999
HECTOR	We'll answer it;	999
	The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.	999
	999
AJAX	If I might in entreaties find success--	999
	As seld I have the chance--I would desire	999
	My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles	999
	Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.	999
	999
HECTOR	AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,	999
	And signify this loving interview	999
	To the expecters of our Trojan part;	999
	Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;	999
	I will go eat with thee and see your knights.	999
	999
AJAX	Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.	999
	999
HECTOR	The worthiest of them tell me name by name;	999
	But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes	999
	Shall find him by his large and portly size.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one	999
	That would be rid of such an enemy;	999
	But that's no welcome: understand more clear,	999
	What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks	999
	And formless ruin of oblivion;	999
	But in this extant moment, faith and troth,	999
	Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,	999
	Bids thee, with most divine integrity,	999
	From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.	999
	999
HECTOR	I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	[To TROILUS]  My well-famed lord of Troy, no	999
	less to you.	999
	999
MENELAUS	Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:	999
	You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.	999
	999
HECTOR	Who must we answer?	999
	999
AENEAS	The noble Menelaus.	999
	999
HECTOR	O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!	999
	Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;	999
	Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:	999
	She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.	999
	999
MENELAUS	Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.	999
	999
HECTOR	O, pardon; I offend.	999
	999
NESTOR	I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft	999
	Labouring for destiny make cruel way	999
	Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,	999
	As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,	999
	Despising many forfeits and subduements,	999
	When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,	999
	Not letting it decline on the declined,	999
	That I have said to some my standers by	999
	'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'	999
	And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,	999
	When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,	999
	Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;	999
	But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,	999
	I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,	999
	And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;	999
	But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,	999
	Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;	999
	And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.	999
	999
AENEAS	'Tis the old Nestor.	999
	999
HECTOR	Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,	999
	That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:	999
	Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.	999
	999
NESTOR	I would my arms could match thee in contention,	999
	As they contend with thee in courtesy.	999
	999
HECTOR	I would they could.	999
	999
NESTOR	Ha!	999
	By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.	999
	Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.	999
	999
ULYSSES	I wonder now how yonder city stands	999
	When we have here her base and pillar by us.	999
	999
HECTOR	I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.	999
	Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,	999
	Since first I saw yourself and Diomed	999
	In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.	999
	999
ULYSSES	Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:	999
	My prophecy is but half his journey yet;	999
	For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,	999
	Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,	999
	Must kiss their own feet.	999
	999
HECTOR	I must not believe you:	999
	There they stand yet, and modestly I think,	999
	The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost	999
	A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,	999
	And that old common arbitrator, Time,	999
	Will one day end it.	999
	999
ULYSSES	So to him we leave it.	999
	Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:	999
	After the general, I beseech you next	999
	To feast with me and see me at my tent.	999
	999
ACHILLES	I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!	999
	Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;	999
	I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,	999
	And quoted joint by joint.	999
	999
HECTOR	Is this Achilles?	999
	999
ACHILLES	I am Achilles.	999
	999
HECTOR	Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Behold thy fill.	999
	999
HECTOR	                  Nay, I have done already.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Thou art too brief: I will the second time,	999
	As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.	999
	999
HECTOR	O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;	999
	But there's more in me than thou understand'st.	999
	Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?	999
	999
ACHILLES	Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body	999
	Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?	999
	That I may give the local wound a name	999
	And make distinct the very breach whereout	999
	Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!	999
	999
HECTOR	It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,	999
	To answer such a question: stand again:	999
	Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly	999
	As to prenominate in nice conjecture	999
	Where thou wilt hit me dead?	999
	999
ACHILLES	I tell thee, yea.	999
	999
HECTOR	Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,	999
	I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;	999
	For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;	999
	But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,	999
	I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.	999
	You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;	999
	His insolence draws folly from my lips;	999
	But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,	999
	Or may I never--	999
	999
AJAX	                  Do not chafe thee, cousin:	999
	And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,	999
	Till accident or purpose bring you to't:	999
	You may have every day enough of Hector	999
	If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,	999
	Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.	999
	999
HECTOR	I pray you, let us see you in the field:	999
	We have had pelting wars, since you refused	999
	The Grecians' cause.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Dost thou entreat me, Hector?	999
	To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;	999
	To-night all friends.	999
	999
HECTOR	Thy hand upon that match.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;	999
	There in the full convive we: afterwards,	999
	As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall	999
	Concur together, severally entreat him.	999
	Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,	999
	That this great soldier may his welcome know.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSES]	999
	999
TROILUS	My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,	999
	In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?	999
	999
ULYSSES	At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:	999
	There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;	999
	Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,	999
	But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view	999
	On the fair Cressid.	999
	999
TROILUS	Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,	999
	After we part from Agamemnon's tent,	999
	To bring me thither?	999
	999
ULYSSES	You shall command me, sir.	999
	As gentle tell me, of what honour was	999
	This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there	999
	That wails her absence?	999
	999
	999
TROILUS	O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars	999
	A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?	999
	She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:	999
	But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.	999
	999

ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS]	999
	999
ACHILLES	I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,	999
	Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.	999
	Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Here comes Thersites.	999
	999
	[Enter THERSITES]	999
	999
ACHILLES	How now, thou core of envy!	999
	Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?	999
	999
THERSITES	Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol	999
	of idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.	999
	999
ACHILLES	From whence, fragment?	999
	999
THERSITES	Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Who keeps the tent now?	999
	999
THERSITES	The surgeon's box, or the patient's wound.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Well said, adversity! and what need these tricks?	999
	999
THERSITES	Prithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk:	999
	thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?	999
	999
THERSITES	Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases	999
	of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs,	999
	loads o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, cold	999
	palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing	999
	lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,	999
	limekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the	999
	rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take	999
	again such preposterous discoveries!	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Why thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest	999
	thou to curse thus?	999
	999
THERSITES	Do I curse thee?	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Why no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson	999
	indistinguishable cur, no.	999
	999
THERSITES	No! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle	999
	immaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenet	999
	flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's	999
	purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered	999
	with such waterflies, diminutives of nature!	999
	999
PATROCLUS	Out, gall!	999
	999
THERSITES	Finch-egg!	999
	999
ACHILLES	My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite	999
	From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.	999
	Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,	999
	A token from her daughter, my fair love,	999
	Both taxing me and gaging me to keep	999
	An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:	999
	Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;	999
	My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.	999
	Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent:	999
	This night in banqueting must all be spent.	999
	Away, Patroclus!	999
	999
	[Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS]	999
	999
THERSITES	With too much blood and too little brain, these two	999
	may run mad; but, if with too much brain and too	999
	little blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen.	999
	Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one	999
	that loves quails; but he has not so much brain as	999
	earwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter	999
	there, his brother, the bull,--the primitive statue,	999
	and oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thrifty	999
	shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's	999
	leg,--to what form but that he is, should wit larded	999
	with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?	999
	To an ass, were nothing; he is both ass and ox: to	999
	an ox, were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a	999
	dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an	999
	owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would	999
	not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire	999
	against destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I	999
	were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse	999
	of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!	999
	spirits and fires!	999
	999
	[Enter HECTOR, TROILUS, AJAX, AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES,	999
	NESTOR, MENELAUS, and DIOMEDES, with lights]	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	We go wrong, we go wrong.	999
	999
AJAX	No, yonder 'tis;	999
	There, where we see the lights.	999
	999
HECTOR	I trouble you.	999
	999
AJAX	No, not a whit.	999
	999
ULYSSES	                  Here comes himself to guide you.	999
	999
	[Re-enter ACHILLES]	999
	999
ACHILLES	Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.	999
	Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.	999
	999
HECTOR	Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.	999
	999
MENELAUS	Good night, my lord.	999
	999
HECTOR	Good night, sweet lord Menelaus.	999
	999
THERSITES	Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,	999
	sweet sewer.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Good night and welcome, both at once, to those	999
	That go or tarry.	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Good night.	999
	999
	[Exeunt AGAMEMNON and MENELAUS]	999
	999
ACHILLES	Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,	999
	Keep Hector company an hour or two.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	I cannot, lord; I have important business,	999
	The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.	999
	999
HECTOR	Give me your hand.	999
	999
ULYSSES	[Aside to TROILUS]  Follow his torch; he goes to	999
	Calchas' tent:	999
	I'll keep you company.	999
	999
TROILUS	Sweet sir, you honour me.	999
	999
HECTOR	And so, good night.	999
	999
	[Exit DIOMEDES; ULYSSES and TROILUS following]	999
	999
ACHILLES	Come, come, enter my tent.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ACHILLES, HECTOR, AJAX, and NESTOR]	999
	999
THERSITES	That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most	999
	unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers	999
	than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend	999
	his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:	999
	but when he performs, astronomers foretell it; it	999
	is prodigious, there will come some change; the sun	999
	borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his	999
	word. I will rather leave to see Hector, than	999
	not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan	999
	drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll	999
	after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!	999

	999
	[Enter DIOMEDES]	999
	999
DIOMEDES	What, are you up here, ho? speak.	999
	999
CALCHAS	[Within]  Who calls?	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?	999
	999
CALCHAS	[Within]  She comes to you.	999
	999
	[Enter TROILUS and ULYSSES, at a distance;	999
	after them, THERSITES]	999
	999
ULYSSES	Stand where the torch may not discover us.	999
	999
	[Enter CRESSIDA]	999
	999
TROILUS	Cressid comes forth to him.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	How now, my charge!	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.	999
	999
	[Whispers]	999
	999
TROILUS	Yea, so familiar!	999
	999
ULYSSES	She will sing any man at first sight.	999
	999
THERSITES	And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff;	999
	she's noted.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Will you remember?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Remember! yes.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Nay, but do, then;	999
	And let your mind be coupled with your words.	999
	999
TROILUS	What should she remember?	999
	999
ULYSSES	List.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.	999
	999
THERSITES	Roguery!	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Nay, then,--	999
	999
CRESSIDA	I'll tell you what,--	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	In faith, I cannot: what would you have me do?	999
	999
THERSITES	A juggling trick,--to be secretly open.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	What did you swear you would bestow on me?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;	999
	Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Good night.	999
	999
TROILUS	Hold, patience!	999
	999
ULYSSES	How now, Trojan!	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Diomed,--	999
	999
DIOMEDES	No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.	999
	999
TROILUS	Thy better must.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Hark, one word in your ear.	999
	999
TROILUS	O plague and madness!	999
	999
ULYSSES	You are moved, prince; let us depart, I pray you,	999
	Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself	999
	To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous;	999
	The time right deadly; I beseech you, go.	999
	999
TROILUS	Behold, I pray you!	999
	999
ULYSSES	Nay, good my lord, go off:	999
	You flow to great distraction; come, my lord.	999
	999
TROILUS	I pray thee, stay.	999
	999
ULYSSES	                  You have not patience; come.	999
	999
TROILUS	I pray you, stay; by hell and all hell's torments	999
	I will not speak a word!	999
	999
DIOMEDES	And so, good night.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Nay, but you part in anger.	999
	999
TROILUS	Doth that grieve thee?	999
	O wither'd truth!	999
	999
ULYSSES	                  Why, how now, lord!	999
	999
TROILUS	By Jove,	999
	I will be patient.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	                  Guardian!--why, Greek!	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Foh, foh! adieu; you palter.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	In faith, I do not: come hither once again.	999
	999
ULYSSES	You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?	999
	You will break out.	999
	999
TROILUS	She strokes his cheek!	999
	999
ULYSSES	Come, come.	999
	999
TROILUS	Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:	999
	There is between my will and all offences	999
	A guard of patience: stay a little while.	999
	999
THERSITES	How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and	999
	potato-finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!	999
	999
DIOMEDES	But will you, then?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Give me some token for the surety of it.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	I'll fetch you one.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ULYSSES	You have sworn patience.	999
	999
TROILUS	Fear me not, sweet lord;	999
	I will not be myself, nor have cognition	999
	Of what I feel: I am all patience.	999
	999
	[Re-enter CRESSIDA]	999
	999
THERSITES	Now the pledge; now, now, now!	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.	999
	999
TROILUS	O beauty! where is thy faith?	999
	999
ULYSSES	My lord,--	999
	999
TROILUS	I will be patient; outwardly I will.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.	999
	He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Whose was't?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	It is no matter, now I have't again.	999
	I will not meet with you to-morrow night:	999
	I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.	999
	999
THERSITES	Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!	999
	999
DIOMEDES	I shall have it.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	                  What, this?	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Ay, that.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!	999
	Thy master now lies thinking in his bed	999
	Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,	999
	And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,	999
	As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;	999
	He that takes that doth take my heart withal.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	I had your heart before, this follows it.	999
	999
TROILUS	I did swear patience.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;	999
	I'll give you something else.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	I will have this: whose was it?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	It is no matter.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Come, tell me whose it was.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.	999
	But, now you have it, take it.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Whose was it?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	By all Diana's waiting-women yond,	999
	And by herself, I will not tell you whose.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,	999
	And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.	999
	999
TROILUS	Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,	999
	It should be challenged.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not;	999
	I will not keep my word.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Why, then, farewell;	999
	Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,	999
	But it straight starts you.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	I do not like this fooling.	999
	999
THERSITES	Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	What, shall I come? the hour?	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Ay, come:--O Jove!--do come:--I shall be plagued.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Farewell till then.	999
	999
CRESSIDA	Good night: I prithee, come.	999
	999
	[Exit DIOMEDES]	999
	999
	Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee	999
	But with my heart the other eye doth see.	999
	Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,	999
	The error of our eye directs our mind:	999
	What error leads must err; O, then conclude	999
	Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
THERSITES	A proof of strength she could not publish more,	999
	Unless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.'	999
	999
ULYSSES	All's done, my lord.	999
	999
TROILUS	It is.	999
	999
ULYSSES	Why stay we, then?	999
	999
TROILUS	To make a recordation to my soul	999
	Of every syllable that here was spoke.	999
	But if I tell how these two did co-act,	999
	Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?	999
	Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,	999
	An esperance so obstinately strong,	999
	That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,	999
	As if those organs had deceptious functions,	999
	Created only to calumniate.	999
	Was Cressid here?	999
	999
ULYSSES	                  I cannot conjure, Trojan.	999
	999
TROILUS	She was not, sure.	999
	999
ULYSSES	                  Most sure she was.	999
	999
TROILUS	Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.	999
	999
ULYSSES	Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.	999
	999
TROILUS	Let it not be believed for womanhood!	999
	Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage	999
	To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,	999
	For depravation, to square the general sex	999
	By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.	999
	999
ULYSSES	What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?	999
	999
TROILUS	Nothing at all, unless that this were she.	999
	999
THERSITES	Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?	999
	999
TROILUS	This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:	999
	If beauty have a soul, this is not she;	999
	If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,	999
	If sanctimony be the gods' delight,	999
	If there be rule in unity itself,	999
	This is not she. O madness of discourse,	999
	That cause sets up with and against itself!	999
	Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt	999
	Without perdition, and loss assume all reason	999
	Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.	999
	Within my soul there doth conduce a fight	999
	Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate	999
	Divides more wider than the sky and earth,	999
	And yet the spacious breadth of this division	999
	Admits no orifex for a point as subtle	999
	As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.	999
	Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;	999
	Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:	999
	Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;	999
	The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed;	999
	And with another knot, five-finger-tied,	999
	The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,	999
	The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics	999
	Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.	999
	999
ULYSSES	May worthy Troilus be half attach'd	999
	With that which here his passion doth express?	999
	999
TROILUS	Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well	999
	In characters as red as Mars his heart	999
	Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy	999
	With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.	999
	Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,	999
	So much by weight hate I her Diomed:	999
	That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;	999
	Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,	999
	My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout	999
	Which shipmen do the hurricano call,	999
	Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,	999
	Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear	999
	In his descent than shall my prompted sword	999
	Falling on Diomed.	999
	999
THERSITES	He'll tickle it for his concupy.	999
	999
TROILUS	O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!	999
	Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,	999
	And they'll seem glorious.	999
	999
ULYSSES	O, contain yourself	999
	Your passion draws ears hither.	999
	999
	[Enter AENEAS]	999
	999
AENEAS	I have been seeking you this hour, my lord:	999
	Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;	999
	Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.	999
	999
	999
TROILUS	Have with you, prince. My courteous lord, adieu.	999
	Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,	999
	Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!	999
	999
ULYSSES	I'll bring you to the gates.	999
	999
TROILUS	Accept distracted thanks.	999
	999
	[Exeunt TROILUS, AENEAS, and ULYSSES]	999
	999
THERSITES	Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would	999
	croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode.	999
	Patroclus will give me any thing for the	999
	intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not	999
	do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.	999
	Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery; nothing	999
	else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!	999

SCENE III	Troy. Before Priam's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter HECTOR and ANDROMACHE]	999
	999
ANDROMACHE	When was my lord so much ungently temper'd,	999
	To stop his ears against admonishment?	999
	Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.	999
	999
HECTOR	You train me to offend you; get you in:	999
	By all the everlasting gods, I'll go!	999
	999
ANDROMACHE	My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.	999
	999
HECTOR	No more, I say.	999
	999
	[Enter CASSANDRA]	999
	999
CASSANDRA	                  Where is my brother Hector?	999
	999
ANDROMACHE	Here, sister; arm'd, and bloody in intent.	999
	Consort with me in loud and dear petition,	999
	Pursue we him on knees; for I have dream'd	999
	Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night	999
	Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.	999
	999
CASSANDRA	O, 'tis true.	999
	999
HECTOR	                  Ho! bid my trumpet sound!	999
	999
CASSANDRA	No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother.	999
	999
HECTOR	Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear.	999
	999
CASSANDRA	The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:	999
	They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd	999
	Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.	999
	999
ANDROMACHE	O, be persuaded! do not count it holy	999
	To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,	999
	For we would give much, to use violent thefts,	999
	And rob in the behalf of charity.	999
	999
CASSANDRA	It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;	999
	But vows to every purpose must not hold:	999
	Unarm, sweet Hector.	999
	999
HECTOR	Hold you still, I say;	999
	Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate:	999
	Lie every man holds dear; but the brave man	999
	Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.	999
	999
	[Enter TROILUS]	999
	999
	How now, young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?	999
	999
ANDROMACHE	Cassandra, call my father to persuade.	999
	999
	[Exit CASSANDRA]	999
	999
HECTOR	No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth;	999
	I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:	999
	Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,	999
	And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.	999
	Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,	999
	I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.	999
	999
TROILUS	Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,	999
	Which better fits a lion than a man.	999
	999
HECTOR	What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it.	999
	999
TROILUS	When many times the captive Grecian falls,	999
	Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,	999
	You bid them rise, and live.	999
	999
HECTOR	O,'tis fair play.	999
	999
TROILUS	                  Fool's play, by heaven, Hector.	999
	999
HECTOR	How now! how now!	999
	999
TROILUS	                  For the love of all the gods,	999
	Let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers,	999
	And when we have our armours buckled on,	999
	The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords,	999
	Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth.	999
	999
HECTOR	Fie, savage, fie!	999
	999
TROILUS	                  Hector, then 'tis wars.	999
	999
HECTOR	Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.	999
	999
TROILUS	Who should withhold me?	999
	Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars	999
	Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire;	999
	Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,	999
	Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears;	999
	Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,	999
	Opposed to hinder me, should stop my way,	999
	But by my ruin.	999
	999
	[Re-enter CASSANDRA, with PRIAM]	999
	999
CASSANDRA	Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:	999
	He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,	999
	Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,	999
	Fall all together.	999
	999
PRIAM	                  Come, Hector, come, go back:	999
	Thy wife hath dream'd; thy mother hath had visions;	999
	Cassandra doth foresee; and I myself	999
	Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt	999
	To tell thee that this day is ominous:	999
	Therefore, come back.	999
	999
HECTOR	AEneas is a-field;	999
	And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,	999
	Even in the faith of valour, to appear	999
	This morning to them.	999
	999
PRIAM	Ay, but thou shalt not go.	999
	999
HECTOR	I must not break my faith.	999
	You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,	999
	Let me not shame respect; but give me leave	999
	To take that course by your consent and voice,	999
	Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.	999
	999
CASSANDRA	O Priam, yield not to him!	999
	999
ANDROMACHE	Do not, dear father.	999
	999
HECTOR	Andromache, I am offended with you:	999
	Upon the love you bear me, get you in.	999
	999
	[Exit ANDROMACHE]	999
	999
TROILUS	This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl	999
	Makes all these bodements.	999
	999
CASSANDRA	O, farewell, dear Hector!	999
	Look, how thou diest! look, how thy eye turns pale!	999
	Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!	999
	Hark, how Troy roars! how Hecuba cries out!	999
	How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!	999
	Behold, distraction, frenzy and amazement,	999
	Like witless antics, one another meet,	999
	And all cry, Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!	999
	999
TROILUS	Away! away!	999
	999
CASSANDRA	Farewell: yet, soft! Hector! take my leave:	999
	Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HECTOR	You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim:	999
	Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,	999
	Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night.	999
	999
PRIAM	Farewell: the gods with safety stand about thee!	999
	999
	[Exeunt severally PRIAM and HECTOR. Alarums]	999
	999
TROILUS	They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,	999
	I come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve.	999
	999
	[Enter PANDARUS]	999
	999
PANDARUS	Do you hear, my lord? do you hear?	999
	999
TROILUS	What now?	999
	999
PANDARUS	Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.	999
	999
TROILUS	Let me read.	999
	999
PANDARUS	A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so	999
	troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl;	999
	and what one thing, what another, that I shall	999
	leave you one o' these days: and I have a rheum	999
	in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones	999
	that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell what	999
	to think on't. What says she there?	999
	999
TROILUS	Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart:	999
	The effect doth operate another way.	999
	999
	[Tearing the letter]	999
	999
	Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together.	999
	My love with words and errors still she feeds;	999
	But edifies another with her deeds.	999

SCENE IV	Plains between Troy and the Grecian camp.	999
	999
	999
	[Alarums: excursions. Enter THERSITES]	999
	999
THERSITES	Now they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go	999
	look on. That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,	999
	has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's	999
	sleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see	999
	them meet; that that same young Trojan ass, that	999
	loves the whore there, might send that Greekish	999
	whore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the	999
	dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand.	999
	O' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty	999
	swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry	999
	cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is	999
	not proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in	999
	policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of	999
	as bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax	999
	prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm	999
	to-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim	999
	barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.	999
	Soft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.	999
	999
	[Enter DIOMEDES, TROILUS following]	999
	999
TROILUS	Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx,	999
	I would swim after.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Thou dost miscall retire:	999
	I do not fly, but advantageous care	999
	Withdrew me from the odds of multitude:	999
	Have at thee!	999
	999
THERSITES	Hold thy whore, Grecian!--now for thy whore,	999
	Trojan!--now the sleeve, now the sleeve!	999

	999
HECTOR	What art thou, Greek? art thou for Hector's match?	999
	Art thou of blood and honour?	999

THERSITES	No, no, I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave:	999

THERSITES	God-a-mercy, that thou wilt believe me; but a	999

	become of the wenching rogues? I think they have	999
	swallowed one another: I would laugh at that	999

	[Enter DIOMEDES and a Servant]	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Go, go, my servant, take thou Troilus' horse;	999
	Present the fair steed to my lady Cressid:	999
	Fellow, commend my service to her beauty;	999
	Tell her I have chastised the amorous Trojan,	999
	And am her knight by proof.	999
	999
Servant	I go, my lord.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter AGAMEMNON]	999
	999
AGAMEMNON	Renew, renew! The fierce Polydamas	999
	Hath beat down Menon: bastard Margarelon	999
	Hath Doreus prisoner,	999
	And stands colossus-wise, waving his beam,	999
	Upon the pashed corses of the kings	999
	Epistrophus and Cedius: Polyxenes is slain,	999
	Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,	999
	Patroclus ta'en or slain, and Palamedes	999
	Sore hurt and bruised: the dreadful Sagittary	999
	Appals our numbers: haste we, Diomed,	999
	To reinforcement, or we perish all.	999
	999
	[Enter NESTOR]	999
	999
NESTOR	Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles;	999
	And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame.	999
	There is a thousand Hectors in the field:	999
	Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,	999
	And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,	999
	And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls	999
	Before the belching whale; then is he yonder,	999
	And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,	999
	Fall down before him, like the mower's swath:	999
	Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes,	999
	Dexterity so obeying appetite	999
	That what he will he does, and does so much	999
	That proof is call'd impossibility.	999
	999
	[Enter ULYSSES]	999
	999
ULYSSES	O, courage, courage, princes! great Achilles	999
	Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance:	999
	Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood,	999
	Together with his mangled Myrmidons,	999
	That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him,	999
	Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend	999
	And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,	999
	Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day	999
	Mad and fantastic execution,	999
	Engaging and redeeming of himself	999
	With such a careless force and forceless care	999
	As if that luck, in very spite of cunning,	999
	Bade him win all.	999
	999

	999
ACHILLES	Where is this Hector?	999
	Come, come, thou boy-queller, show thy face;	999

	Hector? where's Hector? I will none but Hector.	999

DIOMEDES	Troilus, I say! where's Troilus?	999
	999
AJAX	What wouldst thou?	999
	999
DIOMEDES	I would correct him.	999
	999
AJAX	Were I the general, thou shouldst have my office	999
	Ere that correction. Troilus, I say! what, Troilus!	999
	999
	[Enter TROILUS]	999
	999
TROILUS	O traitor Diomed! turn thy false face, thou traitor,	999
	And pay thy life thou owest me for my horse!	999
	999
DIOMEDES	Ha, art thou there?	999
	999
AJAX	I'll fight with him alone: stand, Diomed.	999
	999
DIOMEDES	He is my prize; I will not look upon.	999

	[Enter ACHILLES]	999
	999
ACHILLES	Now do I see thee, ha! have at thee, Hector!	999
	999
HECTOR	Pause, if thou wilt.	999
	999
ACHILLES	I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan:	999
	Be happy that my arms are out of use:	999
	My rest and negligence befriends thee now,	999
	But thou anon shalt hear of me again;	999
	Till when, go seek thy fortune.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HECTOR	Fare thee well:	999
	I would have been much more a fresher man,	999
	Had I expected thee. How now, my brother!	999
	999
	[Re-enter TROILUS]	999
	999
TROILUS	Ajax hath ta'en AEneas: shall it be?	999
	No, by the flame of yonder glorious heaven,	999
	He shall not carry him: I'll be ta'en too,	999
	Or bring him off: fate, hear me what I say!	999
	I reck not though I end my life to-day.	999
	999

HECTOR	Stand, stand, thou Greek; thou art a goodly mark:	999
	No? wilt thou not? I like thy armour well;	999
	I'll frush it and unlock the rivets all,	999
	But I'll be master of it: wilt thou not,	999
	beast, abide?	999
	Why, then fly on, I'll hunt thee for thy hide.	999

ACHILLES	Come here about me, you my Myrmidons;	999
	Mark what I say. Attend me where I wheel:	999
	Strike not a stroke, but keep yourselves in breath:	999
	And when I have the bloody Hector found,	999
	Empale him with your weapons round about;	999
	In fellest manner execute your aims.	999
	Follow me, sirs, and my proceedings eye:	999
	It is decreed Hector the great must die.	999

	999
THERSITES	What art thou?	999
	999
MARGARELON	A bastard son of Priam's.	999
	999
THERSITES	I am a bastard too; I love bastards: I am a bastard	999
	begot, bastard instructed, bastard in mind, bastard	999
	in valour, in every thing illegitimate. One bear will	999
	not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard?	999
	Take heed, the quarrel's most ominous to us: if the	999

	Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.	999
	Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:	999
	Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.	999

	[Enter ACHILLES and Myrmidons]	999
	999
ACHILLES	Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set;	999
	How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:	999
	Even with the vail and darking of the sun,	999
	To close the day up, Hector's life is done.	999
	999
HECTOR	I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek.	999
	999
ACHILLES	Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.	999
	999
	[HECTOR falls]	999
	999
	So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down!	999
	Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.	999
	On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,	999
	'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.'	999
	999
	[A retreat sounded]	999
	999
	Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.	999

MYRMIDONS	The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.	999

	999
TROILUS	He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail,	999
	In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.	999
	Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!	999
	Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!	999
	I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,	999
	And linger not our sure destructions on!	999
	999
AENEAS	My lord, you do discomfort all the host!	999
	999
TROILUS	You understand me not that tell me so:	999
	I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,	999
	But dare all imminence that gods and men	999
	Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:	999
	Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?	999
	Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,	999
	Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:	999
	There is a word will Priam turn to stone;	999
	Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,	999
	Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,	999
	Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:	999
	Hector is dead; there is no more to say.	999
	Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,	999
	Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,	999
	Let Titan rise as early as he dare,	999
	I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,	999
	No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:	999
	I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,	999
	That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.	999
	Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:	999
	Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.	999

	a-work, and how ill requited! why should our	999
	endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?	999
	what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:	999
	Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,	999
	Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;	999
	And being once subdued in armed tail,	999
	Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.	999
	Good traders in the flesh, set this in your	999
	painted cloths.	999
	As many as be here of pander's hall,	999
	Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;	999
	Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,	999
	Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.	999
	Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,	999
	Some two months hence my will shall here be made:	999
	It should be now, but that my fear is this,	999
