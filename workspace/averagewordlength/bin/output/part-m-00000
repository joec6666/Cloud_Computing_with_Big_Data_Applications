	999
SCENE I	Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA,	999
	and LAFEU, all in black]	999
	999
COUNTESS	In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.	999
	999
BERTRAM	And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death	999
	anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to	999
	whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.	999
	999
LAFEU	You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,	999
	sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times	999
	good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose	999
	worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather	999
	than lack it where there is such abundance.	999
	999
COUNTESS	What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?	999
	999
LAFEU	He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose	999
	practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and	999
	finds no other advantage in the process but only the	999
	losing of hope by time.	999
	999
COUNTESS	This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that	999
	'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was	999
	almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so	999
	far, would have made nature immortal, and death	999
	should have play for lack of work. Would, for the	999
	king's sake, he were living! I think it would be	999
	the death of the king's disease.	999
	999
LAFEU	How called you the man you speak of, madam?	999
	999
COUNTESS	He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was	999
	his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.	999
	999
LAFEU	He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very	999
	lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he	999
	was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge	999
	could be set up against mortality.	999
	999
BERTRAM	What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?	999
	999
LAFEU	A fistula, my lord.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I heard not of it before.	999
	999
LAFEU	I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman	999
	the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?	999
	999
COUNTESS	His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my	999
	overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that	999
	her education promises; her dispositions she	999
	inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where	999
	an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there	999
	commendations go with pity; they are virtues and	999
	traitors too; in her they are the better for their	999
	simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.	999
	999
LAFEU	Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.	999
	999
COUNTESS	'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise	999
	in. The remembrance of her father never approaches	999
	her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all	999
	livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;	999
	go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect	999
	a sorrow than have it.	999
	999
HELENA	I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.	999
	999
LAFEU	Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,	999
	excessive grief the enemy to the living.	999
	999
COUNTESS	If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess	999
	makes it soon mortal.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Madam, I desire your holy wishes.	999
	999
LAFEU	How understand we that?	999
	999
COUNTESS	Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father	999
	In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue	999
	Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness	999
	Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,	999
	Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy	999
	Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend	999
	Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,	999
	But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,	999
	That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,	999
	Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;	999
	'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,	999
	Advise him.	999
	999
LAFEU	          He cannot want the best	999
	That shall attend his love.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BERTRAM	[To HELENA]  The best wishes that can be forged in	999
	your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable	999
	to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.	999
	999
LAFEU	Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of	999
	your father.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU]	999
	999
HELENA	O, were that all! I think not on my father;	999
	And these great tears grace his remembrance more	999
	Than those I shed for him. What was he like?	999
	I have forgot him: my imagination	999
	Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.	999
	I am undone: there is no living, none,	999
	If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one	999
	That I should love a bright particular star	999
	And think to wed it, he is so above me:	999
	In his bright radiance and collateral light	999
	Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.	999
	The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:	999
	The hind that would be mated by the lion	999
	Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,	999
	To see him every hour; to sit and draw	999
	His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,	999
	In our heart's table; heart too capable	999
	Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:	999
	But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy	999
	Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter PAROLLES]	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;	999
	And yet I know him a notorious liar,	999
	Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;	999
	Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,	999
	That they take place, when virtue's steely bones	999
	Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see	999
	Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Save you, fair queen!	999
	999
HELENA	And you, monarch!	999
	999
PAROLLES	No.	999
	999
HELENA	And no.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Are you meditating on virginity?	999
	999
HELENA	Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me	999
	ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how	999
	may we barricado it against him?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Keep him out.	999
	999
HELENA	But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,	999
	in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some	999
	warlike resistance.	999
	999
PAROLLES	There is none: man, sitting down before you, will	999
	undermine you and blow you up.	999
	999
HELENA	Bless our poor virginity from underminers and	999
	blowers up! Is there no military policy, how	999
	virgins might blow up men?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be	999
	blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with	999
	the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It	999
	is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to	999
	preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational	999
	increase and there was never virgin got till	999
	virginity was first lost. That you were made of is	999
	metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost	999
	may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is	999
	ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!	999
	999
HELENA	I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.	999
	999
PAROLLES	There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the	999
	rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,	999
	is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible	999
	disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:	999
	virginity murders itself and should be buried in	999
	highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate	999
	offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,	999
	much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very	999
	paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.	999
	Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of	999
	self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the	999
	canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose	999
	by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make	999
	itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the	999
	principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!	999
	999
HELENA	How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it	999
	likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with	999
	lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't	999
	while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.	999
	Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out	999
	of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just	999
	like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not	999
	now. Your date is better in your pie and your	999
	porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,	999
	your old virginity, is like one of our French	999
	withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,	999
	'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;	999
	marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?	999
	999
HELENA	Not my virginity yet [         ]	999
	There shall your master have a thousand loves,	999
	A mother and a mistress and a friend,	999
	A phoenix, captain and an enemy,	999
	A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,	999
	A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;	999
	His humble ambition, proud humility,	999
	His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,	999
	His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world	999
	Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,	999
	That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--	999
	I know not what he shall. God send him well!	999
	The court's a learning place, and he is one--	999
	999
PAROLLES	What one, i' faith?	999
	999
HELENA	That I wish well. 'Tis pity--	999
	999
PAROLLES	What's pity?	999
	999
HELENA	That wishing well had not a body in't,	999
	Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,	999
	Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,	999
	Might with effects of them follow our friends,	999
	And show what we alone must think, which never	999
	Return us thanks.	999

	[Exit]	999
	999
PAROLLES	Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I	999
	will think of thee at court.	999
	999
HELENA	Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Under Mars, I.	999
	999
HELENA	I especially think, under Mars.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Why under Mars?	999
	999
HELENA	The wars have so kept you under that you must needs	999
	be born under Mars.	999
	999
PAROLLES	When he was predominant.	999
	999
HELENA	When he was retrograde, I think, rather.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Why think you so?	999
	999
HELENA	You go so much backward when you fight.	999
	999
PAROLLES	That's for advantage.	999
	999
HELENA	So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;	999
	but the composition that your valour and fear makes	999
	in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.	999
	999
PAROLLES	I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee	999
	acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the	999
	which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize	999
	thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's	999
	counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon	999
	thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and	999
	thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When	999
	thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast	999
	none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,	999
	and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HELENA	Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,	999
	Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky	999
	Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull	999
	Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.	999
	What power is it which mounts my love so high,	999
	That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?	999
	The mightiest space in fortune nature brings	999
	To join like likes and kiss like native things.	999
	Impossible be strange attempts to those	999
	That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose	999
	What hath been cannot be: who ever strove	999
	So show her merit, that did miss her love?	999
	The king's disease--my project may deceive me,	999
	But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.	999

SCENE II	Paris. The KING's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France,	999
	with letters, and divers Attendants]	999
	999
KING	The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;	999
	Have fought with equal fortune and continue	999
	A braving war.	999
	999
First Lord	                  So 'tis reported, sir.	999
	999
KING	Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it	999
	A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,	999
	With caution that the Florentine will move us	999
	For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend	999
	Prejudicates the business and would seem	999
	To have us make denial.	999
	999
First Lord	His love and wisdom,	999
	Approved so to your majesty, may plead	999
	For amplest credence.	999
	999
KING	He hath arm'd our answer,	999
	And Florence is denied before he comes:	999
	Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see	999
	The Tuscan service, freely have they leave	999
	To stand on either part.	999
	999
Second Lord	It well may serve	999
	A nursery to our gentry, who are sick	999
	For breathing and exploit.	999
	999
KING	What's he comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES]	999
	999
First Lord	It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,	999
	Young Bertram.	999
	999
KING	                  Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;	999
	Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,	999
	Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts	999
	Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.	999
	999
BERTRAM	My thanks and duty are your majesty's.	999
	999
KING	I would I had that corporal soundness now,	999
	As when thy father and myself in friendship	999
	First tried our soldiership! He did look far	999
	Into the service of the time and was	999
	Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;	999
	But on us both did haggish age steal on	999
	And wore us out of act. It much repairs me	999
	To talk of your good father. In his youth	999
	He had the wit which I can well observe	999
	To-day in our young lords; but they may jest	999
	Till their own scorn return to them unnoted	999
	Ere they can hide their levity in honour;	999
	So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness	999
	Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,	999
	His equal had awaked them, and his honour,	999
	Clock to itself, knew the true minute when	999
	Exception bid him speak, and at this time	999
	His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him	999
	He used as creatures of another place	999
	And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,	999
	Making them proud of his humility,	999
	In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man	999
	Might be a copy to these younger times;	999
	Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now	999
	But goers backward.	999
	999
BERTRAM	His good remembrance, sir,	999
	Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;	999
	So in approof lives not his epitaph	999
	As in your royal speech.	999
	999
KING	Would I were with him! He would always say--	999
	Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words	999
	He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,	999
	To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--	999
	This his good melancholy oft began,	999
	On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,	999
	When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,	999
	'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff	999
	Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses	999
	All but new things disdain; whose judgments are	999
	Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies	999
	Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;	999
	I after him do after him wish too,	999
	Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,	999
	I quickly were dissolved from my hive,	999
	To give some labourers room.	999
	999
Second Lord	You are loved, sir:	999
	They that least lend it you shall lack you first.	999
	999
KING	I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,	999
	Since the physician at your father's died?	999
	He was much famed.	999
	999
BERTRAM	                  Some six months since, my lord.	999
	999
KING	If he were living, I would try him yet.	999
	Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out	999
	With several applications; nature and sickness	999
	Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;	999
	My son's no dearer.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Thank your majesty.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown]	999
	999
COUNTESS	I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?	999
	999
Steward	Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I	999
	wish might be found in the calendar of my past	999
	endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make	999
	foul the clearness of our deservings, when of	999
	ourselves we publish them.	999
	999
COUNTESS	What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:	999
	the complaints I have heard of you I do not all	999
	believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know	999
	you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability	999
	enough to make such knaveries yours.	999
	999
Clown	'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Well, sir.	999
	999
Clown	No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though	999
	many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have	999
	your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel	999
	the woman and I will do as we may.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Wilt thou needs be a beggar?	999
	999
Clown	I do beg your good will in this case.	999
	999
COUNTESS	In what case?	999
	999
Clown	In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no	999
	heritage: and I think I shall never have the	999
	blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for	999
	they say barnes are blessings.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.	999
	999
Clown	My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on	999
	by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Is this all your worship's reason?	999
	999
Clown	Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they	999
	are.	999
	999
COUNTESS	May the world know them?	999
	999
Clown	I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and	999
	all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry	999
	that I may repent.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.	999
	999
Clown	I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have	999
	friends for my wife's sake.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Such friends are thine enemies, knave.	999
	999
Clown	You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the	999
	knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.	999
	He that ears my land spares my team and gives me	999
	leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my	999
	drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher	999
	of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh	999
	and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my	999
	flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses	999
	my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to	999
	be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;	999
	for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the	999
	Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in	999
	religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl	999
	horns together, like any deer i' the herd.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?	999
	999
Clown	A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next	999
	way:	999
	For I the ballad will repeat,	999
	Which men full true shall find;	999
	Your marriage comes by destiny,	999
	Your cuckoo sings by kind.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.	999
	999
Steward	May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to	999
	you: of her I am to speak.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;	999
	Helen, I mean.	999
	999
Clown	     Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,	999
	Why the Grecians sacked Troy?	999
	Fond done, done fond,	999
	Was this King Priam's joy?	999
	With that she sighed as she stood,	999
	With that she sighed as she stood,	999
	And gave this sentence then;	999
	Among nine bad if one be good,	999
	Among nine bad if one be good,	999
	There's yet one good in ten.	999
	999
COUNTESS	What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.	999
	999
Clown	One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying	999
	o' the song: would God would serve the world so all	999
	the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,	999
	if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we	999
	might have a good woman born but one every blazing	999
	star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery	999
	well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck	999
	one.	999
	999
COUNTESS	You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.	999
	999
Clown	That man should be at woman's command, and yet no	999
	hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it	999
	will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of	999
	humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am	999
	going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
COUNTESS	Well, now.	999
	999
Steward	I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and	999
	she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully	999
	make title to as much love as she finds: there is	999
	more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid	999
	her than she'll demand.	999
	999
Steward	Madam, I was very late more near her than I think	999
	she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate	999
	to herself her own words to her own ears; she	999
	thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any	999
	stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:	999
	Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put	999
	such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no	999
	god, that would not extend his might, only where	999
	qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that	999
	would suffer her poor knight surprised, without	999
	rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.	999
	This she delivered in the most bitter touch of	999
	sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I	999
	held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;	999
	sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns	999
	you something to know it.	999
	999
COUNTESS	You have discharged this honestly; keep it to	999
	yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this	999
	before, which hung so tottering in the balance that	999
	I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,	999
	leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you	999
	for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.	999
	999
	[Exit Steward]	999
	999
	[Enter HELENA]	999
	999
	Even so it was with me when I was young:	999
	If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn	999
	Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;	999
	Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;	999
	It is the show and seal of nature's truth,	999
	Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:	999
	By our remembrances of days foregone,	999
	Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.	999
	Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.	999
	999
HELENA	What is your pleasure, madam?	999
	999
COUNTESS	You know, Helen,	999
	I am a mother to you.	999
	999
HELENA	Mine honourable mistress.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Nay, a mother:	999
	Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'	999
	Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'	999
	That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;	999
	And put you in the catalogue of those	999
	That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen	999
	Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds	999
	A native slip to us from foreign seeds:	999
	You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,	999
	Yet I express to you a mother's care:	999
	God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood	999
	To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,	999
	That this distemper'd messenger of wet,	999
	The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?	999
	Why? that you are my daughter?	999
	999
HELENA	That I am not.	999
	999
COUNTESS	I say, I am your mother.	999
	999
HELENA	Pardon, madam;	999
	The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:	999
	I am from humble, he from honour'd name;	999
	No note upon my parents, his all noble:	999
	My master, my dear lord he is; and I	999
	His servant live, and will his vassal die:	999
	He must not be my brother.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Nor I your mother?	999
	999
HELENA	You are my mother, madam; would you were,--	999
	So that my lord your son were not my brother,--	999
	Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,	999
	I care no more for than I do for heaven,	999
	So I were not his sister. Can't no other,	999
	But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?	999
	999
COUNTESS	Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:	999
	God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother	999
	So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?	999
	My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see	999
	The mystery of your loneliness, and find	999
	Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross	999
	You love my son; invention is ashamed,	999
	Against the proclamation of thy passion,	999
	To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;	999
	But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks	999
	Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes	999
	See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors	999
	That in their kind they speak it: only sin	999
	And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,	999
	That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?	999
	If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;	999
	If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,	999
	As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,	999
	Tell me truly.	999
	999
HELENA	                  Good madam, pardon me!	999
	999
COUNTESS	Do you love my son?	999
	999
HELENA	Your pardon, noble mistress!	999
	999
COUNTESS	Love you my son?	999
	999
HELENA	                  Do not you love him, madam?	999
	999
COUNTESS	Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,	999
	Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose	999
	The state of your affection; for your passions	999
	Have to the full appeach'd.	999
	999
HELENA	Then, I confess,	999
	Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,	999
	That before you, and next unto high heaven,	999
	I love your son.	999
	My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:	999
	Be not offended; for it hurts not him	999
	That he is loved of me: I follow him not	999
	By any token of presumptuous suit;	999
	Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;	999
	Yet never know how that desert should be.	999
	I know I love in vain, strive against hope;	999
	Yet in this captious and intenible sieve	999
	I still pour in the waters of my love	999
	And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,	999
	Religious in mine error, I adore	999
	The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,	999
	But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,	999
	Let not your hate encounter with my love	999
	For loving where you do: but if yourself,	999
	Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,	999
	Did ever in so true a flame of liking	999
	Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian	999
	Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity	999
	To her, whose state is such that cannot choose	999
	But lend and give where she is sure to lose;	999
	That seeks not to find that her search implies,	999
	But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!	999
	999
COUNTESS	Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--	999
	To go to Paris?	999
	999
HELENA	                  Madam, I had.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Wherefore? tell true.	999
	999
HELENA	I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.	999
	You know my father left me some prescriptions	999
	Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading	999
	And manifest experience had collected	999
	For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me	999
	In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,	999
	As notes whose faculties inclusive were	999
	More than they were in note: amongst the rest,	999
	There is a remedy, approved, set down,	999
	To cure the desperate languishings whereof	999
	The king is render'd lost.	999
	999
COUNTESS	This was your motive	999
	For Paris, was it? speak.	999
	999
HELENA	My lord your son made me to think of this;	999
	Else Paris and the medicine and the king	999
	Had from the conversation of my thoughts	999
	Haply been absent then.	999
	999
COUNTESS	But think you, Helen,	999
	If you should tender your supposed aid,	999
	He would receive it? he and his physicians	999
	Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,	999
	They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit	999
	A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,	999
	Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off	999
	The danger to itself?	999
	999
HELENA	There's something in't,	999
	More than my father's skill, which was the greatest	999
	Of his profession, that his good receipt	999
	Shall for my legacy be sanctified	999
	By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour	999
	But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture	999
	The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure	999
	By such a day and hour.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Dost thou believe't?	999
	999
HELENA	Ay, madam, knowingly.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,	999
	Means and attendants and my loving greetings	999
	To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home	999
	And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:	999
	Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,	999
	What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	999
	999
	999
	ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL	999
	999
	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Paris. The KING's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING, attended	999
	with divers young Lords taking leave for the	999
	Florentine war; BERTRAM, and PAROLLES]	999
	999
KING	Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles	999
	Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:	999
	Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all	999
	The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,	999
	And is enough for both.	999
	999
First Lord	'Tis our hope, sir,	999
	After well enter'd soldiers, to return	999
	And find your grace in health.	999
	999
KING	No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart	999
	Will not confess he owes the malady	999
	That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;	999
	Whether I live or die, be you the sons	999
	Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--	999
	Those bated that inherit but the fall	999
	Of the last monarchy,--see that you come	999
	Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when	999
	The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,	999
	That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.	999
	999
Second Lord	Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!	999
	999
KING	Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:	999
	They say, our French lack language to deny,	999
	If they demand: beware of being captives,	999
	Before you serve.	999
	999
Both	                  Our hearts receive your warnings.	999
	999
KING	Farewell. Come hither to me.	999
	999
	[Exit, attended]	999
	999
First Lord	O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!	999
	999
PAROLLES	'Tis not his fault, the spark.	999
	999
Second Lord	O, 'tis brave wars!	999
	999
PAROLLES	Most admirable: I have seen those wars.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I am commanded here, and kept a coil with	999
	'Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.'	999
	999
PAROLLES	An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,	999
	Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,	999
	Till honour be bought up and no sword worn	999
	But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.	999
	999
First Lord	There's honour in the theft.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Commit it, count.	999
	999
Second Lord	I am your accessary; and so, farewell.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.	999
	999
First Lord	Farewell, captain.	999
	999
Second Lord	Sweet Monsieur Parolles!	999
	999
PAROLLES	Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good	999
	sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall	999
	find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain	999
	Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here	999
	on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword	999
	entrenched it: say to him, I live; and observe his	999
	reports for me.	999
	999
First Lord	We shall, noble captain.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Lords]	999
	999
PAROLLES	Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?	999
	999
BERTRAM	Stay: the king.	999
	999
	[Re-enter KING. BERTRAM and PAROLLES retire]	999
	999
PAROLLES	[To BERTRAM]  Use a more spacious ceremony to the	999
	noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the	999
	list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to	999
	them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the	999
	time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and	999
	move under the influence of the most received star;	999
	and though the devil lead the measure, such are to	999
	be followed: after them, and take a more dilated farewell.	999
	999
BERTRAM	And I will do so.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES]	999
	999
	[Enter LAFEU]	999
	999
LAFEU	[Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.	999
	999
KING	I'll fee thee to stand up.	999
	999
LAFEU	Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.	999
	I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,	999
	And that at my bidding you could so stand up.	999
	999
KING	I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,	999
	And ask'd thee mercy for't.	999
	999
LAFEU	Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;	999
	Will you be cured of your infirmity?	999
	999
KING	No.	999
	999
LAFEU	O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?	999
	Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if	999
	My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine	999
	That's able to breathe life into a stone,	999
	Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary	999
	With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,	999
	Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,	999
	To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,	999
	And write to her a love-line.	999
	999
KING	What 'her' is this?	999
	999
LAFEU	Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,	999
	If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,	999
	If seriously I may convey my thoughts	999
	In this my light deliverance, I have spoke	999
	With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,	999
	Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more	999
	Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her	999
	For that is her demand, and know her business?	999
	That done, laugh well at me.	999
	999
KING	Now, good Lafeu,	999
	Bring in the admiration; that we with thee	999
	May spend our wonder too, or take off thine	999
	By wondering how thou took'st it.	999
	999
LAFEU	Nay, I'll fit you,	999
	And not be all day neither.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING	Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.	999
	999
	[Re-enter LAFEU, with HELENA]	999
	999
LAFEU	Nay, come your ways.	999
	999
KING	This haste hath wings indeed.	999
	999
LAFEU	Nay, come your ways:	999
	This is his majesty; say your mind to him:	999
	A traitor you do look like; but such traitors	999
	His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,	999
	That dare leave two together; fare you well.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING	Now, fair one, does your business follow us?	999
	999
HELENA	Ay, my good lord.	999
	Gerard de Narbon was my father;	999
	In what he did profess, well found.	999
	999
KING	I knew him.	999
	999
HELENA	The rather will I spare my praises towards him:	999
	Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death	999
	Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.	999
	Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,	999
	And of his old experience the oily darling,	999
	He bade me store up, as a triple eye,	999
	Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;	999
	And hearing your high majesty is touch'd	999
	With that malignant cause wherein the honour	999
	Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,	999
	I come to tender it and my appliance	999
	With all bound humbleness.	999
	999
KING	We thank you, maiden;	999
	But may not be so credulous of cure,	999
	When our most learned doctors leave us and	999
	The congregated college have concluded	999
	That labouring art can never ransom nature	999
	From her inaidible estate; I say we must not	999
	So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,	999
	To prostitute our past-cure malady	999
	To empirics, or to dissever so	999
	Our great self and our credit, to esteem	999
	A senseless help when help past sense we deem.	999
	999
HELENA	My duty then shall pay me for my pains:	999
	I will no more enforce mine office on you.	999
	Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts	999
	A modest one, to bear me back a again.	999
	999
KING	I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:	999
	Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give	999
	As one near death to those that wish him live:	999
	But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,	999
	I knowing all my peril, thou no art.	999
	999
HELENA	What I can do can do no hurt to try,	999
	Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.	999
	He that of greatest works is finisher	999
	Oft does them by the weakest minister:	999
	So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,	999
	When judges have been babes; great floods have flown	999
	From simple sources, and great seas have dried	999
	When miracles have by the greatest been denied.	999
	Oft expectation fails and most oft there	999
	Where most it promises, and oft it hits	999
	Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.	999
	999
KING	I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;	999
	Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:	999
	Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.	999
	999
HELENA	Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:	999
	It is not so with Him that all things knows	999
	As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;	999
	But most it is presumption in us when	999
	The help of heaven we count the act of men.	999
	Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;	999
	Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.	999
	I am not an impostor that proclaim	999
	Myself against the level of mine aim;	999
	But know I think and think I know most sure	999
	My art is not past power nor you past cure.	999
	999
KING	Are thou so confident? within what space	999
	Hopest thou my cure?	999
	999
HELENA	The great'st grace lending grace	999
	Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring	999
	Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,	999
	Ere twice in murk and occidental damp	999
	Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,	999
	Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass	999
	Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,	999
	What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,	999
	Health shall live free and sickness freely die.	999
	999
KING	Upon thy certainty and confidence	999
	What darest thou venture?	999
	999
HELENA	Tax of impudence,	999
	A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame	999
	Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name	999
	Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended	999
	With vilest torture let my life be ended.	999
	999
KING	Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak	999
	His powerful sound within an organ weak:	999
	And what impossibility would slay	999
	In common sense, sense saves another way.	999
	Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate	999
	Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,	999
	Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all	999
	That happiness and prime can happy call:	999
	Thou this to hazard needs must intimate	999
	Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.	999
	Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,	999
	That ministers thine own death if I die.	999
	999
HELENA	If I break time, or flinch in property	999
	Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,	999
	And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;	999
	But, if I help, what do you promise me?	999
	999
KING	Make thy demand.	999
	999
HELENA	                  But will you make it even?	999
	999
KING	Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.	999
	999
HELENA	Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand	999
	What husband in thy power I will command:	999
	Exempted be from me the arrogance	999
	To choose from forth the royal blood of France,	999
	My low and humble name to propagate	999
	With any branch or image of thy state;	999
	But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know	999
	Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.	999
	999
KING	Here is my hand; the premises observed,	999
	Thy will by my performance shall be served:	999
	So make the choice of thy own time, for I,	999
	Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.	999
	More should I question thee, and more I must,	999
	Though more to know could not be more to trust,	999
	From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest	999
	Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.	999
	Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed	999
	As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.	999

ACT II	999

	999
SCENE II	Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter COUNTESS and Clown]	999
	999
COUNTESS	Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of	999
	your breeding.	999
	999
Clown	I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I	999
	know my business is but to the court.	999
	999
COUNTESS	To the court! why, what place make you special,	999
	when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!	999
	999
Clown	Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he	999
	may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make	999
	a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,	999
	has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed	999
	such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the	999
	court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all	999
	men.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all	999
	questions.	999
	999
Clown	It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,	999
	the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn	999
	buttock, or any buttock.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Will your answer serve fit to all questions?	999
	999
Clown	As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,	999
	as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's	999
	rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove	999
	Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his	999
	hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen	999
	to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the	999
	friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all	999
	questions?	999
	999
Clown	From below your duke to beneath your constable, it	999
	will fit any question.	999
	999
COUNTESS	It must be an answer of most monstrous size that	999
	must fit all demands.	999
	999
Clown	But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned	999
	should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that	999
	belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall	999
	do you no harm to learn.	999
	999
COUNTESS	To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in	999
	question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I	999
	pray you, sir, are you a courtier?	999
	999
Clown	O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,	999
	more, a hundred of them.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.	999
	999
Clown	O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.	999
	999
COUNTESS	I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.	999
	999
Clown	O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.	999
	999
COUNTESS	You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.	999
	999
Clown	O Lord, sir! spare not me.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and	999
	'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very	999
	sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well	999
	to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.	999
	999
Clown	I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,	999
	sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.	999
	999
COUNTESS	I play the noble housewife with the time	999
	To entertain't so merrily with a fool.	999
	999
Clown	O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.	999
	999
COUNTESS	An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,	999
	And urge her to a present answer back:	999
	Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:	999
	This is not much.	999
	999
Clown	Not much commendation to them.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Not much employment for you: you understand me?	999
	999
Clown	Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Haste you again.	999
	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	Paris. The KING's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES]	999
	999
LAFEU	They say miracles are past; and we have our	999
	philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,	999
	things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that	999
	we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves	999
	into seeming knowledge, when we should submit	999
	ourselves to an unknown fear.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath	999
	shot out in our latter times.	999
	999
BERTRAM	And so 'tis.	999
	999
LAFEU	To be relinquish'd of the artists,--	999
	999
PAROLLES	So I say.	999
	999
LAFEU	Both of Galen and Paracelsus.	999
	999
PAROLLES	So I say.	999
	999
LAFEU	Of all the learned and authentic fellows,--	999
	999
PAROLLES	Right; so I say.	999
	999
LAFEU	That gave him out incurable,--	999
	999
PAROLLES	Why, there 'tis; so say I too.	999
	999
LAFEU	Not to be helped,--	999
	999
PAROLLES	Right; as 'twere, a man assured of a--	999
	999
LAFEU	Uncertain life, and sure death.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Just, you say well; so would I have said.	999
	999
LAFEU	I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.	999
	999
PAROLLES	It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you	999
	shall read it in--what do you call there?	999
	999
LAFEU	A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.	999
	999
PAROLLES	That's it; I would have said the very same.	999
	999
LAFEU	Why, your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me,	999
	I speak in respect--	999
	999
PAROLLES	Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the	999
	brief and the tedious of it; and he's of a most	999
	facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the--	999
	999
LAFEU	Very hand of heaven.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Ay, so I say.	999
	999
LAFEU	In a most weak--	999
	999
	[pausing]	999
	999
	and debile minister, great power, great	999
	transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a	999
	further use to be made than alone the recovery of	999
	the king, as to be--	999
	999
	[pausing]	999
	999
	generally thankful.	999
	999
PAROLLES	I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.	999
	999
	[Enter KING, HELENA, and Attendants. LAFEU and	999
	PAROLLES retire]	999
	999
LAFEU	Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I'll like a maid the	999
	better, whilst I have a tooth in my head: why, he's	999
	able to lead her a coranto.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?	999
	999
LAFEU	'Fore God, I think so.	999
	999
KING	Go, call before me all the lords in court.	999
	Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;	999
	And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense	999
	Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive	999
	The confirmation of my promised gift,	999
	Which but attends thy naming.	999
	999
	[Enter three or four Lords]	999
	999
	Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel	999
	Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,	999
	O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice	999
	I have to use: thy frank election make;	999
	Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.	999
	999
HELENA	To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress	999
	Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!	999
	999
LAFEU	I'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,	999
	My mouth no more were broken than these boys',	999
	And writ as little beard.	999
	999
KING	Peruse them well:	999
	Not one of those but had a noble father.	999
	999
HELENA	Gentlemen,	999
	Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.	999
	999
All	We understand it, and thank heaven for you.	999
	999
HELENA	I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,	999
	That I protest I simply am a maid.	999
	Please it your majesty, I have done already:	999
	The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,	999
	'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,	999
	Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;	999
	We'll ne'er come there again.'	999
	999
KING	Make choice; and, see,	999
	Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.	999
	999
HELENA	Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,	999
	And to imperial Love, that god most high,	999
	Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?	999
	999
First Lord	And grant it.	999
	999
HELENA	                  Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.	999
	999
LAFEU	I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace	999
	for my life.	999
	999
HELENA	The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,	999
	Before I speak, too threateningly replies:	999
	Love make your fortunes twenty times above	999
	Her that so wishes and her humble love!	999
	999
Second Lord	No better, if you please.	999
	999
HELENA	My wish receive,	999
	Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.	999
	999
LAFEU	Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,	999
	I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the	999
	Turk, to make eunuchs of.	999
	999
HELENA	Be not afraid that I your hand should take;	999
	I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:	999
	Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed	999
	Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!	999
	999
LAFEU	These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her:	999
	sure, they are bastards to the English; the French	999
	ne'er got 'em.	999
	999
HELENA	You are too young, too happy, and too good,	999
	To make yourself a son out of my blood.	999
	999
Fourth Lord	Fair one, I think not so.	999
	999
LAFEU	There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk	999
	wine: but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth	999
	of fourteen; I have known thee already.	999
	999
HELENA	[To BERTRAM]  I dare not say I take you; but I give	999
	Me and my service, ever whilst I live,	999
	Into your guiding power. This is the man.	999
	999
KING	Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.	999
	999
BERTRAM	My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,	999
	In such a business give me leave to use	999
	The help of mine own eyes.	999
	999
KING	Know'st thou not, Bertram,	999
	What she has done for me?	999
	999
BERTRAM	Yes, my good lord;	999
	But never hope to know why I should marry her.	999
	999
KING	Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.	999
	999
BERTRAM	But follows it, my lord, to bring me down	999
	Must answer for your raising? I know her well:	999
	She had her breeding at my father's charge.	999
	A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain	999
	Rather corrupt me ever!	999
	999
KING	'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which	999
	I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,	999
	Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,	999
	Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off	999
	In differences so mighty. If she be	999
	All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,	999
	A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest	999
	Of virtue for the name: but do not so:	999
	From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,	999
	The place is dignified by the doer's deed:	999
	Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,	999
	It is a dropsied honour. Good alone	999
	Is good without a name. Vileness is so:	999
	The property by what it is should go,	999
	Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;	999
	In these to nature she's immediate heir,	999
	And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,	999
	Which challenges itself as honour's born	999
	And is not like the sire: honours thrive,	999
	When rather from our acts we them derive	999
	Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave	999
	Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave	999
	A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb	999
	Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb	999
	Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?	999
	If thou canst like this creature as a maid,	999
	I can create the rest: virtue and she	999
	Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.	999
	999
KING	Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.	999
	999
HELENA	That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:	999
	Let the rest go.	999
	999
KING	My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,	999
	I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,	999
	Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;	999
	That dost in vile misprision shackle up	999
	My love and her desert; that canst not dream,	999
	We, poising us in her defective scale,	999
	Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,	999
	It is in us to plant thine honour where	999
	We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:	999
	Obey our will, which travails in thy good:	999
	Believe not thy disdain, but presently	999
	Do thine own fortunes that obedient right	999
	Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;	999
	Or I will throw thee from my care for ever	999
	Into the staggers and the careless lapse	999
	Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate	999
	Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,	999
	Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit	999
	My fancy to your eyes: when I consider	999
	What great creation and what dole of honour	999
	Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late	999
	Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now	999
	The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,	999
	Is as 'twere born so.	999
	999
KING	Take her by the hand,	999
	And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise	999
	A counterpoise, if not to thy estate	999
	A balance more replete.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I take her hand.	999
	999
KING	Good fortune and the favour of the king	999
	Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony	999
	Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,	999
	And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast	999
	Shall more attend upon the coming space,	999
	Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,	999
	Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES]	999
	999
LAFEU	[Advancing]  Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Your pleasure, sir?	999
	999
LAFEU	Your lord and master did well to make his	999
	recantation.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Recantation! My lord! my master!	999
	999
LAFEU	Ay; is it not a language I speak?	999
	999
PAROLLES	A most harsh one, and not to be understood without	999
	bloody succeeding. My master!	999
	999
LAFEU	Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?	999
	999
PAROLLES	To any count, to all counts, to what is man.	999
	999
LAFEU	To what is count's man: count's master is of	999
	another style.	999
	999
PAROLLES	You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.	999
	999
LAFEU	I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which	999
	title age cannot bring thee.	999
	999
PAROLLES	What I dare too well do, I dare not do.	999
	999
LAFEU	I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty	999
	wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy	999
	travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the	999
	bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from	999
	believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I	999
	have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care	999
	not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and	999
	that thou't scarce worth.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--	999
	999
LAFEU	Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou	999
	hasten thy trial; which if--Lord have mercy on thee	999
	for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee	999
	well: thy casement I need not open, for I look	999
	through thee. Give me thy hand.	999
	999
PAROLLES	My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.	999
	999
LAFEU	Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.	999
	999
PAROLLES	I have not, my lord, deserved it.	999
	999
LAFEU	Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not	999
	bate thee a scruple.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Well, I shall be wiser.	999
	999
LAFEU	Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at	999
	a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st bound	999
	in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is	999
	to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold	999
	my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,	999
	that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.	999
	999
PAROLLES	My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.	999
	999
LAFEU	I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor	999
	doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by	999
	thee, in what motion age will give me leave.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PAROLLES	Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off	999
	me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must	999
	be patient; there is no fettering of authority.	999
	I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with	999
	any convenience, an he were double and double a	999
	lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I	999
	would of--I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.	999
	999
	[Re-enter LAFEU]	999
	999
LAFEU	Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news	999
	for you: you have a new mistress.	999
	999
PAROLLES	I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make	999
	some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good	999
	lord: whom I serve above is my master.	999
	999
LAFEU	Who? God?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Ay, sir.	999
	999
LAFEU	The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou	999
	garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of	999
	sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set	999
	thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine	999
	honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat	999
	thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and	999
	every man should beat thee: I think thou wast	999
	created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.	999
	999
PAROLLES	This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.	999
	999
LAFEU	Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a	999
	kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and	999
	no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords	999
	and honourable personages than the commission of your	999
	birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not	999
	worth another word, else I'ld call you knave. I leave you.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PAROLLES	Good, very good; it is so then: good, very good;	999
	let it be concealed awhile.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BERTRAM]	999
	999
BERTRAM	Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!	999
	999
PAROLLES	What's the matter, sweet-heart?	999
	999
BERTRAM	Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,	999
	I will not bed her.	999
	999
PAROLLES	What, what, sweet-heart?	999
	999
BERTRAM	O my Parolles, they have married me!	999
	I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.	999
	999
PAROLLES	France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits	999
	The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!	999
	999
BERTRAM	There's letters from my mother: what the import is,	999
	I know not yet.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!	999
	He wears his honour in a box unseen,	999
	That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,	999
	Spending his manly marrow in her arms,	999
	Which should sustain the bound and high curvet	999
	Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions	999
	France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;	999
	Therefore, to the war!	999
	999
BERTRAM	It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,	999
	Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,	999
	And wherefore I am fled; write to the king	999
	That which I durst not speak; his present gift	999
	Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,	999
	Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife	999
	To the dark house and the detested wife.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?	999
	999
BERTRAM	Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.	999
	I'll send her straight away: to-morrow	999
	I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:	999
	A young man married is a man that's marr'd:	999
	Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:	999
	The king has done you wrong: but, hush, 'tis so.	999

	999
HELENA	My mother greets me kindly; is she well?	999
	999
Clown	She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's	999
	very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be	999
	given, she's very well and wants nothing i', the	999
	world; but yet she is not well.	999
	999
HELENA	If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's	999
	not very well?	999
	999
Clown	Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.	999
	999
HELENA	What two things?	999
	999
Clown	One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her	999
	quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence	999
	God send her quickly!	999
	999
	[Enter PAROLLES]	999
	999
PAROLLES	Bless you, my fortunate lady!	999
	999
HELENA	I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own	999
	good fortunes.	999
	999
PAROLLES	You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them	999
	on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?	999
	999
Clown	So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,	999
	I would she did as you say.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Why, I say nothing.	999
	999
Clown	Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's	999
	tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say	999
	nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have	999
	nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which	999
	is within a very little of nothing.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Away! thou'rt a knave.	999
	999
Clown	You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a	999
	knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had	999
	been truth, sir.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.	999
	999
Clown	Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you	999
	taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;	999
	and much fool may you find in you, even to the	999
	world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.	999
	999
PAROLLES	A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.	999
	Madam, my lord will go away to-night;	999
	A very serious business calls on him.	999
	The great prerogative and rite of love,	999
	Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;	999
	But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;	999
	Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,	999
	Which they distil now in the curbed time,	999
	To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy	999
	And pleasure drown the brim.	999
	999
HELENA	What's his will else?	999
	999
PAROLLES	That you will take your instant leave o' the king	999
	And make this haste as your own good proceeding,	999
	Strengthen'd with what apology you think	999
	May make it probable need.	999
	999
HELENA	What more commands he?	999
	999
PAROLLES	That, having this obtain'd, you presently	999
	Attend his further pleasure.	999
	999
HELENA	In every thing I wait upon his will.	999
	999
PAROLLES	I shall report it so.	999

	999
	[Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM]	999
	999
LAFEU	But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.	999
	999
LAFEU	You have it from his own deliverance.	999
	999
BERTRAM	And by other warranted testimony.	999
	999
LAFEU	Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in	999
	knowledge and accordingly valiant.	999
	999
LAFEU	I have then sinned against his experience and	999
	transgressed against his valour; and my state that	999
	way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my	999
	heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you, make	999
	us friends; I will pursue the amity.	999
	999
	[Enter PAROLLES]	999
	999
PAROLLES	[To BERTRAM]  These things shall be done, sir.	999
	999
LAFEU	Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Sir?	999
	999
LAFEU	O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, 's a good	999
	workman, a very good tailor.	999
	999
BERTRAM	[Aside to PAROLLES]  Is she gone to the king?	999
	999
PAROLLES	She is.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Will she away to-night?	999
	999
PAROLLES	As you'll have her.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,	999
	Given order for our horses; and to-night,	999
	When I should take possession of the bride,	999
	End ere I do begin.	999
	999
LAFEU	A good traveller is something at the latter end of a	999
	dinner; but one that lies three thirds and uses a	999
	known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should	999
	be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, captain.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?	999
	999
PAROLLES	I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's	999
	displeasure.	999
	999
LAFEU	You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs	999
	and all, like him that leaped into the custard; and	999
	out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer	999
	question for your residence.	999
	999
BERTRAM	It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.	999
	999
LAFEU	And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's	999
	prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this	999
	of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; the	999
	soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in	999
	matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them	999
	tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur:	999
	I have spoken better of you than you have or will to	999
	deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PAROLLES	An idle lord. I swear.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I think so.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Why, do you not know him?	999
	999
BERTRAM	Yes, I do know him well, and common speech	999
	Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.	999
	999
	[Enter HELENA]	999
	999
HELENA	I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,	999
	Spoke with the king and have procured his leave	999
	For present parting; only he desires	999
	Some private speech with you.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I shall obey his will.	999
	You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,	999
	Which holds not colour with the time, nor does	999
	The ministration and required office	999
	On my particular. Prepared I was not	999
	For such a business; therefore am I found	999
	So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you	999
	That presently you take our way for home;	999
	And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,	999
	For my respects are better than they seem	999
	And my appointments have in them a need	999
	Greater than shows itself at the first view	999
	To you that know them not. This to my mother:	999
	999
	[Giving a letter]	999
	999
	'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so	999
	I leave you to your wisdom.	999
	999
HELENA	Sir, I can nothing say,	999
	But that I am your most obedient servant.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Come, come, no more of that.	999
	999
HELENA	And ever shall	999
	With true observance seek to eke out that	999
	Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd	999
	To equal my great fortune.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Let that go:	999
	My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.	999
	999
HELENA	Pray, sir, your pardon.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Well, what would you say?	999
	999
HELENA	I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,	999
	Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;	999
	But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal	999
	What law does vouch mine own.	999
	999
BERTRAM	What would you have?	999
	999
HELENA	Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.	999
	I would not tell you what I would, my lord:	999
	Faith yes;	999
	Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.	999
	999
HELENA	I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit HELENA]	999
	999
	Go thou toward home; where I will never come	999
	Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.	999

	[Flourish. Enter the DUKE of Florence attended;	999
	the two Frenchmen, with a troop of soldiers.	999
	999
DUKE	So that from point to point now have you heard	999
	The fundamental reasons of this war,	999
	Whose great decision hath much blood let forth	999
	And more thirsts after.	999
	999
First Lord	Holy seems the quarrel	999
	Upon your grace's part; black and fearful	999
	On the opposer.	999
	999
DUKE	Therefore we marvel much our cousin France	999
	Would in so just a business shut his bosom	999
	Against our borrowing prayers.	999
	999
Second Lord	Good my lord,	999
	The reasons of our state I cannot yield,	999
	But like a common and an outward man,	999
	That the great figure of a council frames	999
	By self-unable motion: therefore dare not	999
	Say what I think of it, since I have found	999
	Myself in my incertain grounds to fail	999
	As often as I guess'd.	999
	999
DUKE	Be it his pleasure.	999
	999
First Lord	But I am sure the younger of our nature,	999
	That surfeit on their ease, will day by day	999
	Come here for physic.	999
	999
DUKE	Welcome shall they be;	999
	And all the honours that can fly from us	999

COUNTESS	It hath happened all as I would have had it, save	999
	that he comes not along with her.	999
	999
Clown	By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very	999
	melancholy man.	999
	999
COUNTESS	By what observance, I pray you?	999
	999
Clown	Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the	999
	ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his	999
	teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of	999
	melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.	999
	999
	[Opening a letter]	999
	999
Clown	I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our	999
	old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing	999
	like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:	999
	the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to	999
	love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.	999
	999
COUNTESS	What have we here?	999
	999
Clown	E'en that you have there.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
COUNTESS	[Reads]  I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath	999
	recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded	999
	her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not'	999
	eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it	999
	before the report come. If there be breadth enough	999
	in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty	999
	to you.	Your unfortunate son,	999
			     BERTRAM.	999
	This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.	999
	To fly the favours of so good a king;	999
	To pluck his indignation on thy head	999
	By the misprising of a maid too virtuous	999
	For the contempt of empire.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Clown]	999
	999
Clown	O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two	999
	soldiers and my young lady!	999
	999
COUNTESS	What is the matter?	999
	999
Clown	Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some	999
	comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I	999
	thought he would.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Why should he be killed?	999
	999
Clown	So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:	999
	the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of	999
	men, though it be the getting of children. Here	999
	they come will tell you more: for my part, I only	999
	hear your son was run away.	999

	999
First Gentleman	Save you, good madam.	999
	999
HELENA	Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Do not say so.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,	999
	I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,	999
	That the first face of neither, on the start,	999
	Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:	999
	We met him thitherward; for thence we came,	999
	And, after some dispatch in hand at court,	999
	Thither we bend again.	999
	999
HELENA	Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which	999
	never shall come off, and show me a child begotten	999
	of thy body that I am father to, then call me	999
	husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'	999
	This is a dreadful sentence.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Brought you this letter, gentlemen?	999
	999
First Gentleman	Ay, madam;	999
	And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.	999
	999
COUNTESS	I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;	999
	If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,	999
	Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;	999
	But I do wash his name out of my blood,	999
	And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Ay, madam.	999
	999
COUNTESS	         And to be a soldier?	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,	999
	The duke will lay upon him all the honour	999
	That good convenience claims.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Return you thither?	999
	999
First Gentleman	Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.	999
	999
HELENA	[Reads]  Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.	999
	'Tis bitter.	999
	999
COUNTESS	                  Find you that there?	999
	999
HELENA	Ay, madam.	999
	999
First Gentleman	'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his	999
	heart was not consenting to.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Nothing in France, until he have no wife!	999
	There's nothing here that is too good for him	999
	But only she; and she deserves a lord	999
	That twenty such rude boys might tend upon	999
	And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?	999
	999
First Gentleman	A servant only, and a gentleman	999
	Which I have sometime known.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Parolles, was it not?	999
	999
First Gentleman	Ay, my good lady, he.	999
	999
COUNTESS	A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.	999
	My son corrupts a well-derived nature	999
	With his inducement.	999
	999
First Gentleman	Indeed, good lady,	999
	The fellow has a deal of that too much,	999
	Which holds him much to have.	999
	999
COUNTESS	You're welcome, gentlemen.	999
	I will entreat you, when you see my son,	999
	To tell him that his sword can never win	999
	The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you	999
	Written to bear along.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	We serve you, madam,	999
	In that and all your worthiest affairs.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Not so, but as we change our courtesies.	999
	Will you draw near!	999
	999
	[Exeunt COUNTESS and Gentlemen]	999
	999
HELENA	'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'	999
	Nothing in France, until he has no wife!	999
	Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;	999
	Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I	999
	That chase thee from thy country and expose	999
	Those tender limbs of thine to the event	999
	Of the none-sparing war? and is it I	999
	That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou	999
	Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark	999
	Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,	999
	That ride upon the violent speed of fire,	999
	Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,	999
	That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.	999
	Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;	999
	Whoever charges on his forward breast,	999
	I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;	999
	And, though I kill him not, I am the cause	999
	His death was so effected: better 'twere	999
	I met the ravin lion when he roar'd	999
	With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere	999
	That all the miseries which nature owes	999
	Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,	999
	Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,	999
	As oft it loses all: I will be gone;	999
	My being here it is that holds thee hence:	999
	Shall I stay here to do't?  no, no, although	999
	The air of paradise did fan the house	999
	And angels officed all: I will be gone,	999
	That pitiful rumour may report my flight,	999
	To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!	999
	For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.	999

	999
DUKE	The general of our horse thou art; and we,	999
	Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence	999
	Upon thy promising fortune.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Sir, it is	999
	A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet	999
	We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake	999
	To the extreme edge of hazard.	999
	999
DUKE	Then go thou forth;	999
	And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,	999
	As thy auspicious mistress!	999
	999
BERTRAM	This very day,	999

	999
COUNTESS	Alas! and would you take the letter of her?	999
	Might you not know she would do as she has done,	999
	By sending me a letter? Read it again.	999
	999
Steward	[Reads]	999
	999
	I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:	999
	Ambitious love hath so in me offended,	999
	That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,	999
	With sainted vow my faults to have amended.	999
	Write, write, that from the bloody course of war	999
	My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:	999
	Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far	999
	His name with zealous fervor sanctify:	999
	His taken labours bid him me forgive;	999
	I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth	999
	From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,	999
	Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth:	999
	He is too good and fair for death and me:	999
	Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!	999
	Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,	999
	As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,	999
	I could have well diverted her intents,	999
	Which thus she hath prevented.	999
	999
Steward	Pardon me, madam:	999
	If I had given you this at over-night,	999
	She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,	999
	Pursuit would be but vain.	999
	999
COUNTESS	What angel shall	999
	Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,	999
	Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear	999
	And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath	999
	Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,	999
	To this unworthy husband of his wife;	999
	Let every word weigh heavy of her worth	999
	That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.	999
	Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.	999
	Dispatch the most convenient messenger:	999
	When haply he shall hear that she is gone,	999
	He will return; and hope I may that she,	999
	Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,	999
	Led hither by pure love: which of them both	999
	Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense	999
	To make distinction: provide this messenger:	999
	My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;	999
	Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.	999

SCENE V	Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter an old Widow of Florence, DIANA, VIOLENTA,	999
	and MARIANA, with other Citizens]	999
	999
Widow	Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we	999
	shall lose all the sight.	999
	999
DIANA	They say the French count has done most honourable service.	999
	999
Widow	It is reported that he has taken their greatest	999
	commander; and that with his own hand he slew the	999
	duke's brother.	999
	999
	[Tucket]	999
	999
	We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary	999
	way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.	999
	999
MARIANA	Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with	999
	the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this	999
	French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and	999
	no legacy is so rich as honesty.	999
	999
Widow	I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited	999
	by a gentleman his companion.	999
	999
MARIANA	I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a	999
	filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the	999
	young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,	999
	enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of	999
	lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid	999
	hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,	999
	example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of	999
	maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,	999
	but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten	999
	them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but	999
	I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,	999
	though there were no further danger known but the	999
	modesty which is so lost.	999
	999
DIANA	You shall not need to fear me.	999
	999
Widow	I hope so.	999
	999
	[Enter HELENA, disguised like a Pilgrim]	999
	999
	Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at	999
	my house; thither they send one another: I'll	999
	question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?	999
	999
HELENA	To Saint Jaques le Grand.	999
	Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?	999
	999
Widow	At the Saint Francis here beside the port.	999
	999
HELENA	Is this the way?	999
	999
Widow	Ay, marry, is't.	999
	999
	[A march afar]	999
	999
	Hark you! they come this way.	999
	If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,	999
	But till the troops come by,	999
	I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;	999
	The rather, for I think I know your hostess	999
	As ample as myself.	999
	999
HELENA	Is it yourself?	999
	999
Widow	If you shall please so, pilgrim.	999
	999
HELENA	I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.	999
	999
Widow	You came, I think, from France?	999
	999
HELENA	I did so.	999
	999
Widow	Here you shall see a countryman of yours	999
	That has done worthy service.	999
	999
HELENA	His name, I pray you.	999
	999
DIANA	The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?	999
	999
HELENA	But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:	999
	His face I know not.	999
	999
DIANA	Whatsome'er he is,	999
	He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,	999
	As 'tis reported, for the king had married him	999
	Against his liking: think you it is so?	999
	999
HELENA	Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.	999
	999
DIANA	There is a gentleman that serves the count	999
	Reports but coarsely of her.	999
	999
HELENA	What's his name?	999
	999
DIANA	Monsieur Parolles.	999
	999
HELENA	                  O, I believe with him,	999
	In argument of praise, or to the worth	999
	Of the great count himself, she is too mean	999
	To have her name repeated: all her deserving	999
	Is a reserved honesty, and that	999
	I have not heard examined.	999
	999
DIANA	Alas, poor lady!	999
	'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife	999
	Of a detesting lord.	999
	999
Widow	I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,	999
	Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her	999
	A shrewd turn, if she pleased.	999
	999
HELENA	How do you mean?	999
	May be the amorous count solicits her	999
	In the unlawful purpose.	999
	999
Widow	He does indeed;	999
	And brokes with all that can in such a suit	999
	Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:	999
	But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard	999
	In honestest defence.	999
	999
MARIANA	The gods forbid else!	999
	999
Widow	So, now they come:	999
	999
	[Drum and Colours]	999
	999
	[Enter BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the whole army]	999
	999
	That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;	999
	That, Escalus.	999
	999
HELENA	                  Which is the Frenchman?	999
	999
DIANA	He;	999
	That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.	999
	I would he loved his wife: if he were honester	999
	He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?	999
	999
HELENA	I like him well.	999
	999
DIANA	'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave	999
	That leads him to these places: were I his lady,	999
	I would Poison that vile rascal.	999
	999
HELENA	Which is he?	999
	999
DIANA	That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?	999
	999
HELENA	Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Lose our drum! well.	999
	999
MARIANA	He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.	999
	999
Widow	Marry, hang you!	999
	999
MARIANA	And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!	999
	999
	[Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and army]	999
	999
Widow	The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you	999
	Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents	999
	There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,	999
	Already at my house.	999
	999
HELENA	I humbly thank you:	999
	Please it this matron and this gentle maid	999
	To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking	999
	Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,	999
	I will bestow some precepts of this virgin	999
	Worthy the note.	999
	999
BOTH	                  We'll take your offer kindly.	999

SCENE VI	Camp before Florence.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords]	999
	999
Second Lord	Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his	999
	way.	999
	999
First Lord	If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no	999
	more in your respect.	999
	999
Second Lord	On my life, my lord, a bubble.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Do you think I am so far deceived in him?	999
	999
Second Lord	Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,	999
	without any malice, but to speak of him as my	999
	kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and	999
	endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner	999
	of no one good quality worthy your lordship's	999
	entertainment.	999
	999
First Lord	It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in	999
	his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some	999
	great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I would I knew in what particular action to try him.	999
	999
First Lord	None better than to let him fetch off his drum,	999
	which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.	999
	999
Second Lord	I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly	999
	surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he	999
	knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink	999
	him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he	999
	is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when	999
	we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship	999
	present at his examination: if he do not, for the	999
	promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of	999
	base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the	999
	intelligence in his power against you, and that with	999
	the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never	999
	trust my judgment in any thing.	999
	999
First Lord	O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;	999
	he says he has a stratagem for't: when your	999
	lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to	999
	what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be	999
	melted, if you give him not John Drum's	999
	entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.	999
	Here he comes.	999
	999
	[Enter PAROLLES]	999
	999
Second Lord	[Aside to BERTRAM]  O, for the love of laughter,	999
	hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch	999
	off his drum in any hand.	999
	999
BERTRAM	How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your	999
	disposition.	999
	999
First Lord	A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.	999
	999
PAROLLES	'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!	999
	There was excellent command,--to charge in with our	999
	horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!	999
	999
First Lord	That was not to be blamed in the command of the	999
	service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar	999
	himself could not have prevented, if he had been	999
	there to command.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some	999
	dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is	999
	not to be recovered.	999
	999
PAROLLES	It might have been recovered.	999
	999
BERTRAM	It might; but it is not now.	999
	999
PAROLLES	It is to be recovered: but that the merit of	999
	service is seldom attributed to the true and exact	999
	performer, I would have that drum or another, or	999
	'hic jacet.'	999
	999
BERTRAM	Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you	999
	think your mystery in stratagem can bring this	999
	instrument of honour again into his native quarter,	999
	be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will	999
	grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you	999
	speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.	999
	and extend to you what further becomes his	999
	greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your	999
	worthiness.	999
	999
PAROLLES	By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.	999
	999
BERTRAM	But you must not now slumber in it.	999
	999
PAROLLES	I'll about it this evening: and I will presently	999
	pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my	999
	certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;	999
	and by midnight look to hear further from me.	999
	999
BERTRAM	May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?	999
	999
PAROLLES	I know not what the success will be, my lord; but	999
	the attempt I vow.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of	999
	thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.	999
	999
PAROLLES	I love not many words.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
Second Lord	No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a	999
	strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems	999
	to undertake this business, which he knows is not to	999
	be done; damns himself to do and dares better be	999
	damned than to do't?	999
	999
First Lord	You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it	999
	is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and	999
	for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but	999
	when you find him out, you have him ever after.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of	999
	this that so seriously he does address himself unto?	999
	999
Second Lord	None in the world; but return with an invention and	999
	clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we	999
	have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall	999
	to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.	999
	999
First Lord	We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case	999
	him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:	999
	when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a	999
	sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this	999
	very night.	999
	999
Second Lord	I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Your brother he shall go along with me.	999
	999
Second Lord	As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BERTRAM	Now will I lead you to the house, and show you	999
	The lass I spoke of.	999
	999
First Lord	But you say she's honest.	999
	999
BERTRAM	That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once	999
	And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,	999
	By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,	999
	Tokens and letters which she did re-send;	999
	And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:	999
	Will you go see her?	999
	999
First Lord	With all my heart, my lord.	999

	999
HELENA	If you misdoubt me that I am not she,	999
	I know not how I shall assure you further,	999
	But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.	999
	999
Widow	Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,	999
	Nothing acquainted with these businesses;	999
	And would not put my reputation now	999
	In any staining act.	999
	999
HELENA	Nor would I wish you.	999
	First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,	999
	And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken	999
	Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,	999
	By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,	999
	Err in bestowing it.	999
	999
Widow	I should believe you:	999
	For you have show'd me that which well approves	999
	You're great in fortune.	999
	999
HELENA	Take this purse of gold,	999
	And let me buy your friendly help thus far,	999
	Which I will over-pay and pay again	999
	When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,	999
	Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,	999
	Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,	999
	As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.	999
	Now his important blood will nought deny	999
	That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,	999
	That downward hath succeeded in his house	999
	From son to son, some four or five descents	999
	Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds	999
	In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,	999
	To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,	999
	Howe'er repented after.	999
	999
Widow	Now I see	999
	The bottom of your purpose.	999
	999
HELENA	You see it lawful, then: it is no more,	999
	But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,	999
	Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;	999
	In fine, delivers me to fill the time,	999
	Herself most chastely absent: after this,	999
	To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns	999
	To what is passed already.	999
	999
Widow	I have yielded:	999
	Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,	999
	That time and place with this deceit so lawful	999
	May prove coherent. Every night he comes	999
	With musics of all sorts and songs composed	999
	To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us	999
	To chide him from our eaves; for he persists	999
	As if his life lay on't.	999
	999
HELENA	Why then to-night	999
	Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,	999
	Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed	999
	And lawful meaning in a lawful act,	999
	Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:	999
	But let's about it.	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Without the Florentine camp.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other	999
	Soldiers in ambush]	999
	999
Second Lord	He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.	999
	When you sally upon him, speak what terrible	999
	language you will: though you understand it not	999
	yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to	999
	understand him, unless some one among us whom we	999
	must produce for an interpreter.	999
	999
First Soldier	Good captain, let me be the interpreter.	999
	999
Second Lord	Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?	999
	999
First Soldier	No, sir, I warrant you.	999
	999
Second Lord	But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?	999
	999
First Soldier	E'en such as you speak to me.	999
	999
Second Lord	He must think us some band of strangers i' the	999
	adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of	999
	all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every	999
	one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we	999
	speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to	999
	know straight our purpose: choughs' language,	999
	gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,	999
	interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,	999
	ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,	999
	and then to return and swear the lies he forges.	999
	999
	[Enter PAROLLES]	999
	999
PAROLLES	Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be	999
	time enough to go home. What shall I say I have	999
	done? It must be a very plausive invention that	999
	carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces	999
	have of late knocked too often at my door. I find	999
	my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the	999
	fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not	999
	daring the reports of my tongue.	999
	999
Second Lord	This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue	999
	was guilty of.	999
	999
PAROLLES	What the devil should move me to undertake the	999
	recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the	999
	impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I	999
	must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in	999
	exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they	999
	will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great	999
	ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the	999
	instance? Tongue, I must put you into a	999
	butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of	999
	Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.	999
	999
Second Lord	Is it possible he should know what he is, and be	999
	that he is?	999
	999
PAROLLES	I would the cutting of my garments would serve the	999
	turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.	999
	999
Second Lord	We cannot afford you so.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in	999
	stratagem.	999
	999
Second Lord	'Twould not do.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.	999
	999
Second Lord	Hardly serve.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.	999
	999
Second Lord	How deep?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Thirty fathom.	999
	999
Second Lord	Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.	999
	999
PAROLLES	I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear	999
	I recovered it.	999
	999
Second Lord	You shall hear one anon.	999
	999
PAROLLES	A drum now of the enemy's,--	999
	999
	[Alarum within]	999
	999
Second Lord	Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.	999
	999
All	Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.	999
	999
PAROLLES	O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.	999
	999
	[They seize and blindfold him]	999
	999
First Soldier	Boskos thromuldo boskos.	999
	999
PAROLLES	I know you are the Muskos' regiment:	999
	And I shall lose my life for want of language;	999
	If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,	999
	Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll	999
	Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.	999
	999
First Soldier	Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak	999
	thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy	999
	faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.	999
	999
PAROLLES	O!	999
	999
First Soldier	O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.	999
	999
Second Lord	Oscorbidulchos volivorco.	999
	999
First Soldier	The general is content to spare thee yet;	999
	And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on	999
	To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform	999
	Something to save thy life.	999
	999
PAROLLES	O, let me live!	999
	And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,	999
	Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that	999
	Which you will wonder at.	999
	999
First Soldier	But wilt thou faithfully?	999
	999
PAROLLES	If I do not, damn me.	999
	999
First Soldier	Acordo linta.	999
	Come on; thou art granted space.	999
	999
	[Exit, with PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within]	999
	999
Second Lord	Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,	999
	We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled	999
	Till we do hear from them.	999
	999
Second Soldier	Captain, I will.	999
	999
Second Lord	A' will betray us all unto ourselves:	999
	Inform on that.	999
	999
Second Soldier	                  So I will, sir.	999
	999
Second Lord	Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.	999

SCENE II	Florence. The Widow's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter BERTRAM and DIANA]	999
	999
BERTRAM	They told me that your name was Fontibell.	999
	999
DIANA	No, my good lord, Diana.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Titled goddess;	999
	And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,	999
	In your fine frame hath love no quality?	999
	If quick fire of youth light not your mind,	999
	You are no maiden, but a monument:	999
	When you are dead, you should be such a one	999
	As you are now, for you are cold and stem;	999
	And now you should be as your mother was	999
	When your sweet self was got.	999
	999
DIANA	She then was honest.	999
	999
BERTRAM	So should you be.	999
	999
DIANA	No:	999
	My mother did but duty; such, my lord,	999
	As you owe to your wife.	999
	999
BERTRAM	No more o' that;	999
	I prithee, do not strive against my vows:	999
	I was compell'd to her; but I love thee	999
	By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever	999
	Do thee all rights of service.	999
	999
DIANA	Ay, so you serve us	999
	Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,	999
	You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves	999
	And mock us with our bareness.	999
	999
BERTRAM	How have I sworn!	999
	999
DIANA	'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,	999
	But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.	999
	What is not holy, that we swear not by,	999
	But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,	999
	If I should swear by God's great attributes,	999
	I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,	999
	When I did love you ill? This has no holding,	999
	To swear by him whom I protest to love,	999
	That I will work against him: therefore your oaths	999
	Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,	999
	At least in my opinion.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Change it, change it;	999
	Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;	999
	And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts	999
	That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,	999
	But give thyself unto my sick desires,	999
	Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever	999
	My love as it begins shall so persever.	999
	999
DIANA	I see that men make ropes in such a scarre	999
	That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power	999
	To give it from me.	999
	999
DIANA	Will you not, my lord?	999
	999
BERTRAM	It is an honour 'longing to our house,	999
	Bequeathed down from many ancestors;	999
	Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world	999
	In me to lose.	999
	999
DIANA	                  Mine honour's such a ring:	999
	My chastity's the jewel of our house,	999
	Bequeathed down from many ancestors;	999
	Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world	999
	In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom	999
	Brings in the champion Honour on my part,	999
	Against your vain assault.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Here, take my ring:	999
	My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,	999
	And I'll be bid by thee.	999
	999
DIANA	When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:	999
	I'll order take my mother shall not hear.	999
	Now will I charge you in the band of truth,	999
	When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,	999
	Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:	999
	My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them	999
	When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:	999
	And on your finger in the night I'll put	999
	Another ring, that what in time proceeds	999
	May token to the future our past deeds.	999
	Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won	999
	A wife of me, though there my hope be done.	999
	999
BERTRAM	A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DIANA	For which live long to thank both heaven and me!	999
	You may so in the end.	999
	My mother told me just how he would woo,	999
	As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men	999
	Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me	999
	When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him	999
	When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,	999
	Marry that will, I live and die a maid:	999
	Only in this disguise I think't no sin	999
	To cozen him that would unjustly win.	999

	999
SCENE III	The Florentine camp.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers]	999
	999
First Lord	You have not given him his mother's letter?	999
	999
Second Lord	I have delivered it an hour since: there is	999
	something in't that stings his nature; for on the	999
	reading it he changed almost into another man.	999
	999
First Lord	He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking	999
	off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.	999
	999
Second Lord	Especially he hath incurred the everlasting	999
	displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his	999
	bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a	999
	thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.	999
	999
First Lord	When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the	999
	grave of it.	999
	999
Second Lord	He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in	999
	Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he	999
	fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath	999
	given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself	999
	made in the unchaste composition.	999
	999
First Lord	Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,	999
	what things are we!	999
	999
Second Lord	Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course	999
	of all treasons, we still see them reveal	999
	themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,	999
	so he that in this action contrives against his own	999
	nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.	999
	999
First Lord	Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of	999
	our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his	999
	company to-night?	999
	999
Second Lord	Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.	999
	999
First Lord	That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see	999
	his company anatomized, that he might take a measure	999
	of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had	999
	set this counterfeit.	999
	999
Second Lord	We will not meddle with him till he come; for his	999
	presence must be the whip of the other.	999
	999
First Lord	In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?	999
	999
Second Lord	I hear there is an overture of peace.	999
	999
First Lord	Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.	999
	999
Second Lord	What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel	999
	higher, or return again into France?	999
	999
First Lord	I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether	999
	of his council.	999
	999
Second Lord	Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal	999
	of his act.	999
	999
First Lord	Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his	999
	house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques	999
	le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere	999
	sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the	999
	tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her	999
	grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and	999
	now she sings in heaven.	999
	999
Second Lord	How is this justified?	999
	999
First Lord	The stronger part of it by her own letters, which	999
	makes her story true, even to the point of her	999
	death: her death itself, which could not be her	999
	office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by	999
	the rector of the place.	999
	999
Second Lord	Hath the count all this intelligence?	999
	999
First Lord	Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from	999
	point, so to the full arming of the verity.	999
	999
Second Lord	I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.	999
	999
First Lord	How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!	999
	999
Second Lord	And how mightily some other times we drown our gain	999
	in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath	999
	here acquired for him shall at home be encountered	999
	with a shame as ample.	999
	999
First Lord	The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and	999
	ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our	999
	faults whipped them not; and our crimes would	999
	despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
	How now! where's your master?	999
	999
Servant	He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath	999
	taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next	999
	morning for France. The duke hath offered him	999
	letters of commendations to the king.	999
	999
Second Lord	They shall be no more than needful there, if they	999
	were more than they can commend.	999
	999
First Lord	They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.	999
	Here's his lordship now.	999
	999
	[Enter BERTRAM]	999
	999
	How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?	999
	999
BERTRAM	I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a	999
	month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:	999
	I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his	999
	nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my	999
	lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;	999
	and between these main parcels of dispatch effected	999
	many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but	999
	that I have not ended yet.	999
	999
Second Lord	If the business be of any difficulty, and this	999
	morning your departure hence, it requires haste of	999
	your lordship.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to	999
	hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this	999
	dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,	999
	bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived	999
	me, like a double-meaning prophesier.	999
	999
Second Lord	Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,	999
	poor gallant knave.	999
	999
BERTRAM	No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping	999
	his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?	999
	999
Second Lord	I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry	999
	him. But to answer you as you would be understood;	999
	he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he	999
	hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes	999
	to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to	999
	this very instant disaster of his setting i' the	999
	stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?	999
	999
BERTRAM	Nothing of me, has a'?	999
	999
Second Lord	His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his	999
	face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you	999
	are, you must have the patience to hear it.	999
	999
	[Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier]	999
	999
BERTRAM	A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of	999
	me: hush, hush!	999
	999
First Lord	Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa	999
	999
First Soldier	He calls for the tortures: what will you say	999
	without 'em?	999
	999
PAROLLES	I will confess what I know without constraint: if	999
	ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.	999
	999
First Soldier	Bosko chimurcho.	999
	999
First Lord	Boblibindo chicurmurco.	999
	999
First Soldier	You are a merciful general. Our general bids you	999
	answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.	999
	999
PAROLLES	And truly, as I hope to live.	999
	999
First Soldier	[Reads]  'First demand of him how many horse the	999
	duke is strong.' What say you to that?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Five or six thousand; but very weak and	999
	unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and	999
	the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation	999
	and credit and as I hope to live.	999
	999
First Soldier	Shall I set down your answer so?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.	999
	999
BERTRAM	All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!	999
	999
First Lord	You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur	999
	Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own	999
	phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the	999
	knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of	999
	his dagger.	999
	999
Second Lord	I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword	999
	clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him	999
	by wearing his apparel neatly.	999
	999
First Soldier	Well, that's set down.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say	999
	true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.	999
	999
First Lord	He's very near the truth in this.	999
	999
BERTRAM	But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he	999
	delivers it.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Poor rogues, I pray you, say.	999
	999
First Soldier	Well, that's set down.	999
	999
PAROLLES	I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the	999
	rogues are marvellous poor.	999
	999
First Soldier	[Reads]  'Demand of him, of what strength they are	999
	a-foot.' What say you to that?	999
	999
PAROLLES	By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present	999
	hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a	999
	hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so	999
	many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,	999
	and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own	999
	company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and	999
	fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and	999
	sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand	999
	poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off	999
	their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.	999
	999
BERTRAM	What shall be done to him?	999
	999
First Lord	Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my	999
	condition, and what credit I have with the duke.	999
	999
First Soldier	Well, that's set down.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain	999
	be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is	999
	with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and	999
	expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not	999
	possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to	999
	corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what	999
	do you know of it?	999
	999
PAROLLES	I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of	999
	the inter'gatories: demand them singly.	999
	999
First Soldier	Do you know this Captain Dumain?	999
	999
PAROLLES	I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,	999
	from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's	999
	fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not	999
	say him nay.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know	999
	his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.	999
	999
First Soldier	Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.	999
	999
First Lord	Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your	999
	lordship anon.	999
	999
First Soldier	What is his reputation with the duke?	999
	999
PAROLLES	The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer	999
	of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him	999
	out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.	999
	999
First Soldier	Marry, we'll search.	999
	999
PAROLLES	In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,	999
	or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters	999
	in my tent.	999
	999
First Soldier	Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?	999
	999
PAROLLES	I do not know if it be it or no.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Our interpreter does it well.	999
	999
First Lord	Excellently.	999
	999
First Soldier	[Reads]  'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--	999
	999
PAROLLES	That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an	999
	advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one	999
	Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count	999
	Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very	999
	ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.	999
	999
First Soldier	Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.	999
	999
PAROLLES	My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the	999
	behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be	999
	a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to	999
	virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Damnable both-sides rogue!	999
	999
First Soldier	[Reads]  'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;	999
	After he scores, he never pays the score:	999
	Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;	999
	He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;	999
	And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,	999
	Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:	999
	For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,	999
	Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.	999
	Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,	999
			  PAROLLES.'	999
	999
BERTRAM	He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme	999
	in's forehead.	999
	999
Second Lord	This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold	999
	linguist and the armipotent soldier.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now	999
	he's a cat to me.	999
	999
First Soldier	I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be	999
	fain to hang you.	999
	999
PAROLLES	My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to	999
	die; but that, my offences being many, I would	999
	repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,	999
	sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.	999
	999
First Soldier	We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;	999
	therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you	999
	have answered to his reputation with the duke and to	999
	his valour: what is his honesty?	999
	999
PAROLLES	He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for	999
	rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he	999
	professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he	999
	is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with	999
	such volubility, that you would think truth were a	999
	fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will	999
	be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little	999
	harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they	999
	know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but	999
	little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has	999
	every thing that an honest man should not have; what	999
	an honest man should have, he has nothing.	999
	999
First Lord	I begin to love him for this.	999
	999
BERTRAM	For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon	999
	him for me, he's more and more a cat.	999
	999
First Soldier	What say you to his expertness in war?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English	999
	tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of	999
	his soldiership I know not; except, in that country	999
	he had the honour to be the officer at a place there	999
	called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of	999
	files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of	999
	this I am not certain.	999
	999
First Lord	He hath out-villained villany so far, that the	999
	rarity redeems him.	999
	999
BERTRAM	A pox on him, he's a cat still.	999
	999
First Soldier	His qualities being at this poor price, I need not	999
	to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple	999
	of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the	999
	entail from all remainders, and a perpetual	999
	succession for it perpetually.	999
	999
First Soldier	What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?	999
	999
Second Lord	Why does be ask him of me?	999
	999
First Soldier	What's he?	999
	999
PAROLLES	E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so	999
	great as the first in goodness, but greater a great	999
	deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,	999
	yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is:	999
	in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming	999
	on he has the cramp.	999
	999
First Soldier	If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray	999
	the Florentine?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.	999
	999
First Soldier	I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.	999
	999
PAROLLES	[Aside]  I'll no more drumming; a plague of all	999
	drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to	999
	beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy	999
	the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who	999
	would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?	999
	999
First Soldier	There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the	999
	general says, you that have so traitorously	999
	discovered the secrets of your army and made such	999
	pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can	999
	serve the world for no honest use; therefore you	999
	must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.	999
	999
PAROLLES	O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!	999
	999
First Lord	That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.	999
	999
	[Unblinding him]	999
	999
	So, look about you: know you any here?	999
	999
BERTRAM	Good morrow, noble captain.	999
	999
Second Lord	God bless you, Captain Parolles.	999
	999
First Lord	God save you, noble captain.	999
	999
Second Lord	Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?	999
	I am for France.	999
	999
First Lord	Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet	999
	you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?	999
	an I were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you:	999
	but fare you well.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BERTRAM and Lords]	999
	999
First Soldier	You are undone, captain, all but your scarf; that	999
	has a knot on't yet	999
	999
PAROLLES	Who cannot be crushed with a plot?	999
	999
First Soldier	If you could find out a country where but women were	999
	that had received so much shame, you might begin an	999
	impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France	999
	too: we shall speak of you there.	999
	999
	[Exit with Soldiers]	999
	999
PAROLLES	Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,	999
	'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;	999
	But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft	999
	As captain shall: simply the thing I am	999
	Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,	999
	Let him fear this, for it will come to pass	999
	that every braggart shall be found an ass.	999
	Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live	999
	Safest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive!	999
	There's place and means for every man alive.	999
	I'll after them.	999

	999
	[Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA]	999
	999
HELENA	That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,	999
	One of the greatest in the Christian world	999
	Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,	999
	Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:	999
	Time was, I did him a desired office,	999
	Dear almost as his life; which gratitude	999
	Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,	999
	And answer, thanks: I duly am inform'd	999
	His grace is at Marseilles; to which place	999
	We have convenient convoy. You must know	999
	I am supposed dead: the army breaking,	999
	My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,	999
	And by the leave of my good lord the king,	999
	We'll be before our welcome.	999
	999
Widow	Gentle madam,	999
	You never had a servant to whose trust	999
	Your business was more welcome.	999
	999
HELENA	Nor you, mistress,	999
	Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour	999
	To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven	999
	Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,	999
	As it hath fated her to be my motive	999
	And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!	999
	That can such sweet use make of what they hate,	999
	When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts	999
	Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play	999
	With what it loathes for that which is away.	999
	But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,	999
	Under my poor instructions yet must suffer	999
	Something in my behalf.	999
	999
DIANA	Let death and honesty	999
	Go with your impositions, I am yours	999
	Upon your will to suffer.	999
	999
HELENA	Yet, I pray you:	999
	But with the word the time will bring on summer,	999
	When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,	999
	And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;	999
	Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us:	999
	All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;	999
	Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.	999

	999
	999
SCENE V	Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown]	999
	999
LAFEU	No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta	999
	fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have	999
	made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in	999
	his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at	999
	this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced	999
	by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.	999
	999
COUNTESS	I would I had not known him; it was the death of the	999
	most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had	999
	praise for creating. If she had partaken of my	999
	flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I	999
	could not have owed her a more rooted love.	999
	999
LAFEU	'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a	999
	thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.	999
	999
Clown	Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the	999
	salad, or rather, the herb of grace.	999
	999
LAFEU	They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.	999
	999
Clown	I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much	999
	skill in grass.	999
	999
LAFEU	Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?	999
	999
Clown	A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.	999
	999
LAFEU	Your distinction?	999
	999
Clown	I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.	999
	999
LAFEU	So you were a knave at his service, indeed.	999
	999
Clown	And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.	999
	999
LAFEU	I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.	999
	999
Clown	At your service.	999
	999
LAFEU	No, no, no.	999
	999
Clown	Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as	999
	great a prince as you are.	999
	999
LAFEU	Who's that? a Frenchman?	999
	999
Clown	Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy	999
	is more hotter in France than there.	999
	999
LAFEU	What prince is that?	999
	999
Clown	The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of	999
	darkness; alias, the devil.	999
	999
LAFEU	Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this	999
	to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;	999
	serve him still.	999
	999
Clown	I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a	999
	great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a	999
	good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the	999
	world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for	999
	the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be	999
	too little for pomp to enter: some that humble	999
	themselves may; but the many will be too chill and	999
	tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that	999
	leads to the broad gate and the great fire.	999
	999
LAFEU	Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I	999
	tell thee so before, because I would not fall out	999
	with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well	999
	looked to, without any tricks.	999
	999
Clown	If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be	999
	jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LAFEU	A shrewd knave and an unhappy.	999
	999
COUNTESS	So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much	999
	sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,	999
	which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,	999
	indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.	999
	999
LAFEU	I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to	999
	tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and	999
	that my lord your son was upon his return home, I	999
	moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of	999
	my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,	999
	his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did	999
	first propose: his highness hath promised me to do	999
	it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath	999
	conceived against your son, there is no fitter	999
	matter. How does your ladyship like it?	999
	999
COUNTESS	With very much content, my lord; and I wish it	999
	happily effected.	999
	999
LAFEU	His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able	999
	body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here	999
	to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such	999
	intelligence hath seldom failed.	999
	999
COUNTESS	It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I	999
	die. I have letters that my son will be here	999
	to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain	999
	with me till they meet together.	999
	999
LAFEU	Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might	999
	safely be admitted.	999
	999
COUNTESS	You need but plead your honourable privilege.	999
	999
LAFEU	Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I	999
	thank my God it holds yet.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Clown]	999
	999
Clown	O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of	999
	velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't	999
	or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of	999
	velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a	999
	half, but his right cheek is worn bare.	999
	999
LAFEU	A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery	999
	of honour; so belike is that.	999
	999
Clown	But it is your carbonadoed face.	999
	999
LAFEU	Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk	999
	with the young noble soldier.	999
	999
Clown	Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine	999
	hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head	999
	and nod at every man.	999

HELENA	But this exceeding posting day and night	999

	But since you have made the days and nights as one,	999
	To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,	999

	999

	999
Gentleman	And you.	999
	999
HELENA	Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.	999
	999
Gentleman	I have been sometimes there.	999

Gentleman	What's your will?	999
	999
HELENA	That it will please you	999

	Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.	999
	I do beseech you, whither is he gone?	999
	999
Gentleman	Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;	999
	Whither I am going.	999
	999
HELENA	I do beseech you, sir,	999
	Since you are like to see the king before me,	999
	Commend the paper to his gracious hand,	999
	Which I presume shall render you no blame	999
	But rather make you thank your pains for it.	999
	I will come after you with what good speed	999
	Our means will make us means.	999
	999
Gentleman	This I'll do for you.	999
	999
HELENA	And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,	999
	Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again.	999
	Go, go, provide.	999

SCENE II	Rousillon. Before the COUNT's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Clown, and PAROLLES, following]	999
	999
PAROLLES	Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this	999
	letter: I have ere now, sir, been better known to	999
	you, when I have held familiarity with fresher	999
	clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's	999
	mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong	999
	displeasure.	999
	999
Clown	Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it	999
	smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will	999
	henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.	999
	Prithee, allow the wind.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake	999
	but by a metaphor.	999
	999
Clown	Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my	999
	nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get	999
	thee further.	999
	999
PAROLLES	Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.	999
	999
Clown	Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's	999
	close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he	999
	comes himself.	999
	999
	[Enter LAFEU]	999
	999
	Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune's	999
	cat,--but not a musk-cat,--that has fallen into the	999
	unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he	999
	says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the	999
	carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,	999
	ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his	999
	distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to	999
	your lordship.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PAROLLES	My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly	999
	scratched.	999
	999
LAFEU	And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to	999
	pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the	999
	knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who	999
	of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves	999
	thrive long under her? There's a quart d'ecu for	999
	you: let the justices make you and fortune friends:	999
	I am for other business.	999
	999
PAROLLES	I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.	999
	999
LAFEU	You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't;	999
	save your word.	999
	999
PAROLLES	My name, my good lord, is Parolles.	999
	999
LAFEU	You beg more than 'word,' then. Cox my passion!	999
	give me your hand. How does your drum?	999
	999
PAROLLES	O my good lord, you were the first that found me!	999
	999
LAFEU	Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.	999
	999
PAROLLES	It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace,	999
	for you did bring me out.	999
	999
LAFEU	Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once	999
	both the office of God and the devil? One brings	999
	thee in grace and the other brings thee out.	999
	999
	[Trumpets sound]	999
	999
	The king's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah,	999
	inquire further after me; I had talk of you last	999
	night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall	999
	eat; go to, follow.	999
	999
PAROLLES	I praise God for you.	999

SCENE III	Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two	999
	French Lords, with Attendants]	999
	999
KING	We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem	999
	Was made much poorer by it: but your son,	999
	As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know	999
	Her estimation home.	999
	999
COUNTESS	'Tis past, my liege;	999
	And I beseech your majesty to make it	999
	Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;	999
	When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,	999
	O'erbears it and burns on.	999
	999
KING	My honour'd lady,	999
	I have forgiven and forgotten all;	999
	Though my revenges were high bent upon him,	999
	And watch'd the time to shoot.	999
	999
LAFEU	This I must say,	999
	But first I beg my pardon, the young lord	999
	Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady	999
	Offence of mighty note; but to himself	999
	The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife	999
	Whose beauty did astonish the survey	999
	Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,	999
	Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve	999
	Humbly call'd mistress.	999
	999
KING	Praising what is lost	999
	Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;	999
	We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill	999
	All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;	999
	The nature of his great offence is dead,	999
	And deeper than oblivion we do bury	999
	The incensing relics of it: let him approach,	999
	A stranger, no offender; and inform him	999
	So 'tis our will he should.	999
	999
Gentleman	I shall, my liege.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING	What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?	999
	999
LAFEU	All that he is hath reference to your highness.	999
	999
KING	Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me	999
	That set him high in fame.	999
	999
	[Enter BERTRAM]	999
	999
LAFEU	He looks well on't.	999
	999
KING	I am not a day of season,	999
	For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail	999
	In me at once: but to the brightest beams	999
	Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;	999
	The time is fair again.	999
	999
BERTRAM	My high-repented blames,	999
	Dear sovereign, pardon to me.	999
	999
KING	All is whole;	999
	Not one word more of the consumed time.	999
	Let's take the instant by the forward top;	999
	For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees	999
	The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time	999
	Steals ere we can effect them. You remember	999
	The daughter of this lord?	999
	999
BERTRAM	Admiringly, my liege, at first	999
	I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart	999
	Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue	999
	Where the impression of mine eye infixing,	999
	Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,	999
	Which warp'd the line of every other favour;	999
	Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;	999
	Extended or contracted all proportions	999
	To a most hideous object: thence it came	999
	That she whom all men praised and whom myself,	999
	Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye	999
	The dust that did offend it.	999
	999
KING	Well excused:	999
	That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away	999
	From the great compt: but love that comes too late,	999
	Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,	999
	To the great sender turns a sour offence,	999
	Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults	999
	Make trivial price of serious things we have,	999
	Not knowing them until we know their grave:	999
	Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,	999
	Destroy our friends and after weep their dust	999
	Our own love waking cries to see what's done,	999
	While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.	999
	Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.	999
	Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:	999
	The main consents are had; and here we'll stay	999
	To see our widower's second marriage-day.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!	999
	Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!	999
	999
LAFEU	Come on, my son, in whom my house's name	999
	Must be digested, give a favour from you	999
	To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,	999
	That she may quickly come.	999
	999
	[BERTRAM gives a ring]	999
	999
		     By my old beard,	999
	And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,	999
	Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,	999
	The last that e'er I took her at court,	999
	I saw upon her finger.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Hers it was not.	999
	999
KING	Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,	999
	While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.	999
	This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,	999
	I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood	999
	Necessitied to help, that by this token	999
	I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave	999
	her	999
	Of what should stead her most?	999
	999
BERTRAM	My gracious sovereign,	999
	Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,	999
	The ring was never hers.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Son, on my life,	999
	I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it	999
	At her life's rate.	999
	999
LAFEU	I am sure I saw her wear it.	999
	999
BERTRAM	You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:	999
	In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,	999
	Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name	999
	Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought	999
	I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed	999
	To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully	999
	I could not answer in that course of honour	999
	As she had made the overture, she ceased	999
	In heavy satisfaction and would never	999
	Receive the ring again.	999
	999
KING	Plutus himself,	999
	That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,	999
	Hath not in nature's mystery more science	999
	Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,	999
	Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know	999
	That you are well acquainted with yourself,	999
	Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement	999
	You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety	999
	That she would never put it from her finger,	999
	Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,	999
	Where you have never come, or sent it us	999
	Upon her great disaster.	999
	999
BERTRAM	She never saw it.	999
	999
KING	Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;	999
	And makest conjectural fears to come into me	999
	Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove	999
	That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--	999
	And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,	999
	And she is dead; which nothing, but to close	999
	Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,	999
	More than to see this ring. Take him away.	999
	999
	[Guards seize BERTRAM]	999
	999
	My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,	999
	Shall tax my fears of little vanity,	999
	Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!	999
	We'll sift this matter further.	999
	999
BERTRAM	If you shall prove	999
	This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy	999
	Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,	999
	Where yet she never was.	999
	999
	[Exit, guarded]	999
	999
KING	I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.	999
	999
	[Enter a Gentleman]	999
	999
Gentleman	Gracious sovereign,	999
	Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:	999
	Here's a petition from a Florentine,	999
	Who hath for four or five removes come short	999
	To tender it herself. I undertook it,	999
	Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech	999
	Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know	999
	Is here attending: her business looks in her	999
	With an importing visage; and she told me,	999
	In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern	999
	Your highness with herself.	999
	999
KING	[Reads]  Upon his many protestations to marry me	999
	when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won	999
	me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows	999
	are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He	999
	stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow	999
	him to his country for justice: grant it me, O	999
	king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer	999
	flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.	999
		                  DIANA CAPILET.	999
	999
LAFEU	I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for	999
	this: I'll none of him.	999
	999
KING	The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,	999
	To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:	999
	Go speedily and bring again the count.	999
	I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,	999
	Was foully snatch'd.	999
	999
COUNTESS	Now, justice on the doers!	999
	999
	[Re-enter BERTRAM, guarded]	999
	999
KING	I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,	999
	And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,	999
	Yet you desire to marry.	999
	999
	[Enter Widow and DIANA]	999
	999
		   What woman's that?	999
	999
DIANA	I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,	999
	Derived from the ancient Capilet:	999
	My suit, as I do understand, you know,	999
	And therefore know how far I may be pitied.	999
	999
Widow	I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour	999
	Both suffer under this complaint we bring,	999
	And both shall cease, without your remedy.	999
	999
KING	Come hither, count; do you know these women?	999
	999
BERTRAM	My lord, I neither can nor will deny	999
	But that I know them: do they charge me further?	999
	999
DIANA	Why do you look so strange upon your wife?	999
	999
BERTRAM	She's none of mine, my lord.	999
	999
DIANA	If you shall marry,	999
	You give away this hand, and that is mine;	999
	You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;	999
	You give away myself, which is known mine;	999
	For I by vow am so embodied yours,	999
	That she which marries you must marry me,	999
	Either both or none.	999
	999
LAFEU	Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you	999
	are no husband for her.	999
	999
BERTRAM	My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,	999
	Whom sometime I have laugh'd with: let your highness	999
	Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour	999
	Than for to think that I would sink it here.	999
	999
KING	Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend	999
	Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour	999
	Than in my thought it lies.	999
	999
DIANA	Good my lord,	999
	Ask him upon his oath, if he does think	999
	He had not my virginity.	999
	999
KING	What say'st thou to her?	999
	999
BERTRAM	She's impudent, my lord,	999
	And was a common gamester to the camp.	999
	999
DIANA	He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,	999
	He might have bought me at a common price:	999
	Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,	999
	Whose high respect and rich validity	999
	Did lack a parallel; yet for all that	999
	He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,	999
	If I be one.	999
	999
COUNTESS	                  He blushes, and 'tis it:	999
	Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,	999
	Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,	999
	Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;	999
	That ring's a thousand proofs.	999
	999
KING	Methought you said	999
	You saw one here in court could witness it.	999
	999
DIANA	I did, my lord, but loath am to produce	999
	So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.	999
	999
LAFEU	I saw the man to-day, if man he be.	999
	999
KING	Find him, and bring him hither.	999
	999
	[Exit an Attendant]	999
	999
BERTRAM	What of him?	999
	He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,	999
	With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;	999
	Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.	999
	Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,	999
	That will speak any thing?	999
	999
KING	She hath that ring of yours.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I think she has: certain it is I liked her,	999
	And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:	999
	She knew her distance and did angle for me,	999
	Madding my eagerness with her restraint,	999
	As all impediments in fancy's course	999
	Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,	999
	Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,	999
	Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;	999
	And I had that which any inferior might	999
	At market-price have bought.	999
	999
DIANA	I must be patient:	999
	You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,	999
	May justly diet me. I pray you yet;	999
	Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;	999
	Send for your ring, I will return it home,	999
	And give me mine again.	999
	999
BERTRAM	I have it not.	999
	999
KING	What ring was yours, I pray you?	999
	999
DIANA	Sir, much like	999
	The same upon your finger.	999
	999
KING	Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.	999
	999
DIANA	And this was it I gave him, being abed.	999
	999
KING	The story then goes false, you threw it him	999
	Out of a casement.	999
	999
DIANA	                  I have spoke the truth.	999
	999
	[Enter PAROLLES]	999
	999
BERTRAM	My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.	999
	999
KING	You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.	999
	Is this the man you speak of?	999
	999
DIANA	Ay, my lord.	999
	999
KING	Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,	999
	Not fearing the displeasure of your master,	999
	Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,	999
	By him and by this woman here what know you?	999
	999
PAROLLES	So please your majesty, my master hath been an	999
	honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,	999
	which gentlemen have.	999
	999
KING	Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?	999
	999
KING	How, I pray you?	999
	999
PAROLLES	He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.	999
	999
KING	How is that?	999
	999
PAROLLES	He loved her, sir, and loved her not.	999
	999
KING	As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an	999
	equivocal companion is this!	999
	999
PAROLLES	I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.	999
	999
LAFEU	He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.	999
	999
DIANA	Do you know he promised me marriage?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Faith, I know more than I'll speak.	999
	999
KING	But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?	999
	999
PAROLLES	Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,	999
	as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for	999
	indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and	999
	of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I	999
	was in that credit with them at that time that I	999
	knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,	999
	as promising her marriage, and things which would	999
	derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not	999
	speak what I know.	999
	999
KING	Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say	999
	they are married: but thou art too fine in thy	999
	evidence; therefore stand aside.	999
	This ring, you say, was yours?	999
	999
DIANA	Ay, my good lord.	999
	999
KING	Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?	999
	999
DIANA	It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.	999
	999
KING	Who lent it you?	999
	999
DIANA	                  It was not lent me neither.	999
	999
KING	Where did you find it, then?	999
	999
DIANA	I found it not.	999
	999
KING	If it were yours by none of all these ways,	999
	How could you give it him?	999
	999
DIANA	I never gave it him.	999
	999
LAFEU	This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off	999
	and on at pleasure.	999
	999
KING	This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.	999
	999
DIANA	It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.	999
	999
KING	Take her away; I do not like her now;	999
	To prison with her: and away with him.	999
	Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,	999
	Thou diest within this hour.	999
	999
DIANA	I'll never tell you.	999
	999
KING	Take her away.	999
	999
DIANA	                  I'll put in bail, my liege.	999
	999
KING	I think thee now some common customer.	999
	999
DIANA	By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.	999
	999
KING	Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?	999
	999
DIANA	Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:	999
	He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;	999
	I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.	999
	Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;	999
	I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.	999
	999
KING	She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.	999
	999
DIANA	Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:	999
	999
	[Exit Widow]	999
	999
	The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,	999
	And he shall surety me. But for this lord,	999
	Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,	999
	Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:	999
	He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;	999
	And at that time he got his wife with child:	999
	Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:	999
	So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:	999
	And now behold the meaning.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Widow, with HELENA]	999
	999
KING	Is there no exorcist	999
	Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?	999
	Is't real that I see?	999
	999
HELENA	No, my good lord;	999
	'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,	999
	The name and not the thing.	999
	999
BERTRAM	Both, both. O, pardon!	999
	999
HELENA	O my good lord, when I was like this maid,	999
	I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;	999
	And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:	999
	'When from my finger you can get this ring	999
	And are by me with child,' &c. This is done:	999
	Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?	999
	999
BERTRAM	If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,	999
	I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.	999
	999
HELENA	If it appear not plain and prove untrue,	999
	Deadly divorce step between me and you!	999
	O my dear mother, do I see you living?	999
	999
LAFEU	Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:	999
	999
	[To PAROLLES]	999
	999
	Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,	999
	I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:	999
	Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.	999
	999
KING	Let us from point to point this story know,	999
	To make the even truth in pleasure flow.	999
	999
	[To DIANA]	999
	999
	If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,	999
	Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;	999
	For I can guess that by thy honest aid	999
	Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.	999
	Of that and all the progress, more or less,	999
	Resolvedly more leisure shall express:	999
	All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,	999

	All is well ended, if this suit be won,	999
	That you express content; which we will pay,	999

	999
SCENE I	Orchard of Oliver's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ORLANDO and ADAM]	999
	999
ORLANDO	As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion	999
	bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,	999
	and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his	999
	blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my	999
	sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and	999
	report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,	999
	he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more	999
	properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you	999
	that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that	999
	differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses	999
	are bred better; for, besides that they are fair	999
	with their feeding, they are taught their manage,	999
	and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his	999
	brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the	999
	which his animals on his dunghills are as much	999
	bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so	999
	plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave	999
	me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets	999
	me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a	999
	brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my	999
	gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that	999
	grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I	999
	think is within me, begins to mutiny against this	999
	servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I	999
	know no wise remedy how to avoid it.	999
	999
ADAM	Yonder comes my master, your brother.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will	999
	shake me up.	999
	999
	[Enter OLIVER]	999
	999
OLIVER	Now, sir! what make you here?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.	999
	999
OLIVER	What mar you then, sir?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God	999
	made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.	999
	999
OLIVER	Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?	999
	What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should	999
	come to such penury?	999
	999
OLIVER	Know you where your are, sir?	999
	999
ORLANDO	O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.	999
	999
OLIVER	Know you before whom, sir?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know	999
	you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle	999
	condition of blood, you should so know me. The	999
	courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that	999
	you are the first-born; but the same tradition	999
	takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers	999
	betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as	999
	you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is	999
	nearer to his reverence.	999
	999
OLIVER	What, boy!	999
	999
ORLANDO	Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.	999
	999
OLIVER	Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?	999
	999
ORLANDO	I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir	999
	Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice	999
	a villain that says such a father begot villains.	999
	Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand	999
	from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy	999
	tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.	999
	999
ADAM	Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's	999
	remembrance, be at accord.	999
	999
OLIVER	Let me go, I say.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My	999
	father charged you in his will to give me good	999
	education: you have trained me like a peasant,	999
	obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like	999
	qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in	999
	me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow	999
	me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or	999
	give me the poor allottery my father left me by	999
	testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.	999
	999
OLIVER	And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?	999
	Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled	999
	with you; you shall have some part of your will: I	999
	pray you, leave me.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.	999
	999
OLIVER	Get you with him, you old dog.	999
	999
ADAM	Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my	999
	teeth in your service. God be with my old master!	999
	he would not have spoke such a word.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM]	999
	999
OLIVER	Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will	999
	physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand	999
	crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!	999
	999
	[Enter DENNIS]	999
	999
DENNIS	Calls your worship?	999
	999
OLIVER	Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?	999
	999
DENNIS	So please you, he is here at the door and importunes	999
	access to you.	999
	999
OLIVER	Call him in.	999
	999
	[Exit DENNIS]	999
	999
	'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.	999
	999
	[Enter CHARLES]	999
	999
CHARLES	Good morrow to your worship.	999
	999
OLIVER	Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the	999
	new court?	999
	999
CHARLES	There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:	999
	that is, the old duke is banished by his younger	999
	brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords	999
	have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,	999
	whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;	999
	therefore he gives them good leave to wander.	999
	999
OLIVER	Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be	999
	banished with her father?	999
	999
CHARLES	O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves	999
	her, being ever from their cradles bred together,	999
	that she would have followed her exile, or have died	999
	to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no	999
	less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and	999
	never two ladies loved as they do.	999
	999
OLIVER	Where will the old duke live?	999
	999
CHARLES	They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and	999
	a many merry men with him; and there they live like	999
	the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young	999
	gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time	999
	carelessly, as they did in the golden world.	999
	999
OLIVER	What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?	999
	999
CHARLES	Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a	999
	matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand	999
	that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition	999
	to come in disguised against me to try a fall.	999
	To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that	999
	escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him	999
	well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,	999
	for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I	999
	must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,	999
	out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you	999
	withal, that either you might stay him from his	999
	intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall	999
	run into, in that it is a thing of his own search	999
	and altogether against my will.	999
	999
OLIVER	Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which	999
	thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had	999
	myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and	999
	have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from	999
	it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:	999
	it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full	999
	of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's	999
	good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against	999
	me his natural brother: therefore use thy	999
	discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck	999
	as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if	999
	thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not	999
	mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise	999
	against thee by poison, entrap thee by some	999
	treacherous device and never leave thee till he	999
	hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;	999
	for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak	999
	it, there is not one so young and so villanous this	999
	day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but	999
	should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must	999
	blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.	999
	999
CHARLES	I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come	999
	to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go	999
	alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and	999
	so God keep your worship!	999
	999
OLIVER	Farewell, good Charles.	999
	999
	[Exit CHARLES]	999
	999
	Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see	999
	an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,	999
	hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never	999
	schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of	999
	all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much	999
	in the heart of the world, and especially of my own	999
	people, who best know him, that I am altogether	999
	misprised: but it shall not be so long; this	999
	wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that	999
	I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter CELIA and ROSALIND]	999
	999
CELIA	I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;	999
	and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could	999
	teach me to forget a banished father, you must not	999
	learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.	999
	999
CELIA	Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight	999
	that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,	999
	had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou	999
	hadst been still with me, I could have taught my	999
	love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,	999
	if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously	999
	tempered as mine is to thee.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to	999
	rejoice in yours.	999
	999
CELIA	You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is	999
	like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt	999
	be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy	999
	father perforce, I will render thee again in	999
	affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break	999
	that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my	999
	sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.	999
	999
ROSALIND	From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let	999
	me see; what think you of falling in love?	999
	999
CELIA	Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but	999
	love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport	999
	neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst	999
	in honour come off again.	999
	999
ROSALIND	What shall be our sport, then?	999
	999
CELIA	Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from	999
	her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I would we could do so, for her benefits are	999
	mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman	999
	doth most mistake in her gifts to women.	999
	999
CELIA	'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce	999
	makes honest, and those that she makes honest she	999
	makes very ill-favouredly.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to	999
	Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,	999
	not in the lineaments of Nature.	999
	999
	[Enter TOUCHSTONE]	999
	999
CELIA	No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she	999
	not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature	999
	hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not	999
	Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when	999
	Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of	999
	Nature's wit.	999
	999
CELIA	Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but	999
	Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull	999
	to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this	999
	natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of	999
	the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,	999
	wit! whither wander you?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Mistress, you must come away to your father.	999
	999
CELIA	Were you made the messenger?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Where learned you that oath, fool?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they	999
	were good pancakes and swore by his honour the	999
	mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the	999
	pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and	999
	yet was not the knight forsworn.	999
	999
CELIA	How prove you that, in the great heap of your	999
	knowledge?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and	999
	swear by your beards that I am a knave.	999
	999
CELIA	By our beards, if we had them, thou art.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you	999
	swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no	999
	more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he	999
	never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away	999
	before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.	999
	999
CELIA	Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	One that old Frederick, your father, loves.	999
	999
CELIA	My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!	999
	speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation	999
	one of these days.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what	999
	wise men do foolishly.	999
	999
CELIA	By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little	999
	wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery	999
	that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes	999
	Monsieur Le Beau.	999
	999
ROSALIND	With his mouth full of news.	999
	999
CELIA	Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Then shall we be news-crammed.	999
	999
CELIA	All the better; we shall be the more marketable.	999
	999
	[Enter LE BEAU]	999
	999
	Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?	999
	999
LE BEAU	Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.	999
	999
CELIA	Sport! of what colour?	999
	999
LE BEAU	What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?	999
	999
ROSALIND	As wit and fortune will.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Or as the Destinies decree.	999
	999
CELIA	Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Nay, if I keep not my rank,--	999
	999
ROSALIND	Thou losest thy old smell.	999
	999
LE BEAU	You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good	999
	wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.	999
	999
ROSALIND	You tell us the manner of the wrestling.	999
	999
LE BEAU	I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please	999
	your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is	999
	yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming	999
	to perform it.	999
	999
CELIA	Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.	999
	999
LE BEAU	There comes an old man and his three sons,--	999
	999
CELIA	I could match this beginning with an old tale.	999
	999
LE BEAU	Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.	999
	999
ROSALIND	With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men	999
	by these presents.'	999
	999
LE BEAU	The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the	999
	duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him	999
	and broke three of his ribs, that there is little	999
	hope of life in him: so he served the second, and	999
	so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,	999
	their father, making such pitiful dole over them	999
	that all the beholders take his part with weeping.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Alas!	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies	999
	have lost?	999
	999
LE BEAU	Why, this that I speak of.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first	999
	time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport	999
	for ladies.	999
	999
CELIA	Or I, I promise thee.	999
	999
ROSALIND	But is there any else longs to see this broken music	999
	in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon	999
	rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?	999
	999
LE BEAU	You must, if you stay here; for here is the place	999
	appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to	999
	perform it.	999
	999
CELIA	Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO,	999
	CHARLES, and Attendants]	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his	999
	own peril on his forwardness.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Is yonder the man?	999
	999
LE BEAU	Even he, madam.	999
	999
CELIA	Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither	999
	to see the wrestling?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;	999
	there is such odds in the man. In pity of the	999
	challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he	999
	will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if	999
	you can move him.	999
	999
CELIA	Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	Do so: I'll not be by.	999
	999
LE BEAU	Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I attend them with all respect and duty.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?	999
	999
ORLANDO	No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I	999
	come but in, as others do, to try with him the	999
	strength of my youth.	999
	999
CELIA	Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your	999
	years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's	999
	strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or	999
	knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your	999
	adventure would counsel you to a more equal	999
	enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to	999
	embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore	999
	be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke	999
	that the wrestling might not go forward.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I beseech you, punish me not with your hard	999
	thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny	999
	so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let	999
	your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my	999
	trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one	999
	shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one	999
	dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my	999
	friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the	999
	world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in	999
	the world I fill up a place, which may be better	999
	supplied when I have made it empty.	999
	999
ROSALIND	The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.	999
	999
CELIA	And mine, to eke out hers.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!	999
	999
CELIA	Your heart's desires be with you!	999
	999
CHARLES	Come, where is this young gallant that is so	999
	desirous to lie with his mother earth?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	You shall try but one fall.	999
	999
CHARLES	No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him	999
	to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him	999
	from a first.	999
	999
ORLANDO	An you mean to mock me after, you should not have	999
	mocked me before: but come your ways.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!	999
	999
CELIA	I would I were invisible, to catch the strong	999
	fellow by the leg.	999
	999
	[They wrestle]	999
	999
ROSALIND	O excellent young man!	999
	999
CELIA	If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who	999
	should down.	999
	999
	[Shout. CHARLES is thrown]	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	No more, no more.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	How dost thou, Charles?	999
	999
LE BEAU	He cannot speak, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	I would thou hadst been son to some man else:	999
	The world esteem'd thy father honourable,	999
	But I did find him still mine enemy:	999
	Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,	999
	Hadst thou descended from another house.	999
	But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:	999
	I would thou hadst told me of another father.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU]	999
	999
CELIA	Were I my father, coz, would I do this?	999
	999
ORLANDO	I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,	999
	His youngest son; and would not change that calling,	999
	To be adopted heir to Frederick.	999
	999
ROSALIND	My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,	999
	And all the world was of my father's mind:	999
	Had I before known this young man his son,	999
	I should have given him tears unto entreaties,	999
	Ere he should thus have ventured.	999
	999
CELIA	Gentle cousin,	999
	Let us go thank him and encourage him:	999
	My father's rough and envious disposition	999
	Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:	999
	If you do keep your promises in love	999
	But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,	999
	Your mistress shall be happy.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Gentleman,	999
	999
	[Giving him a chain from her neck]	999
	999
	Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,	999
	That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.	999
	Shall we go, coz?	999
	999
CELIA	                  Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts	999
	Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up	999
	Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.	999
	999
ROSALIND	He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;	999
	I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?	999
	Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown	999
	More than your enemies.	999
	999
CELIA	Will you go, coz?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Have with you. Fare you well.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA]	999
	999
ORLANDO	What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?	999
	I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.	999
	O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!	999
	Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.	999
	999
	[Re-enter LE BEAU]	999
	999
LE BEAU	Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you	999
	To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved	999
	High commendation, true applause and love,	999
	Yet such is now the duke's condition	999
	That he misconstrues all that you have done.	999
	The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,	999
	More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:	999
	Which of the two was daughter of the duke	999
	That here was at the wrestling?	999
	999
LE BEAU	Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;	999
	But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter	999
	The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,	999
	And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,	999
	To keep his daughter company; whose loves	999
	Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.	999
	But I can tell you that of late this duke	999
	Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,	999
	Grounded upon no other argument	999
	But that the people praise her for her virtues	999
	And pity her for her good father's sake;	999
	And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady	999
	Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:	999
	Hereafter, in a better world than this,	999
	I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.	999
	999
	[Exit LE BEAU]	999
	999
	Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;	999
	From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:	999
	But heavenly Rosalind!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	A room in the palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CELIA and ROSALIND]	999
	999
CELIA	Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Not one to throw at a dog.	999
	999
CELIA	No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon	999
	curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one	999
	should be lamed with reasons and the other mad	999
	without any.	999
	999
CELIA	But is all this for your father?	999
	999
ROSALIND	No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how	999
	full of briers is this working-day world!	999
	999
CELIA	They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in	999
	holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden	999
	paths our very petticoats will catch them.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.	999
	999
CELIA	Hem them away.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.	999
	999
CELIA	Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.	999
	999
ROSALIND	O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!	999
	999
CELIA	O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in	999
	despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of	999
	service, let us talk in good earnest: is it	999
	possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so	999
	strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?	999
	999
ROSALIND	The duke my father loved his father dearly.	999
	999
CELIA	Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son	999
	dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,	999
	for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate	999
	not Orlando.	999
	999
ROSALIND	No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.	999
	999
CELIA	Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Let me love him for that, and do you love him	999
	because I do. Look, here comes the duke.	999
	999
CELIA	With his eyes full of anger.	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords]	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste	999
	And get you from our court.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Me, uncle?	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	You, cousin	999
	Within these ten days if that thou be'st found	999
	So near our public court as twenty miles,	999
	Thou diest for it.	999
	999
ROSALIND	                  I do beseech your grace,	999
	Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:	999
	If with myself I hold intelligence	999
	Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,	999
	If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--	999
	As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,	999
	Never so much as in a thought unborn	999
	Did I offend your highness.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	Thus do all traitors:	999
	If their purgation did consist in words,	999
	They are as innocent as grace itself:	999
	Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:	999
	Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.	999
	999
ROSALIND	So was I when your highness took his dukedom;	999
	So was I when your highness banish'd him:	999
	Treason is not inherited, my lord;	999
	Or, if we did derive it from our friends,	999
	What's that to me? my father was no traitor:	999
	Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much	999
	To think my poverty is treacherous.	999
	999
CELIA	Dear sovereign, hear me speak.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,	999
	Else had she with her father ranged along.	999
	999
CELIA	I did not then entreat to have her stay;	999
	It was your pleasure and your own remorse:	999
	I was too young that time to value her;	999
	But now I know her: if she be a traitor,	999
	Why so am I; we still have slept together,	999
	Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,	999
	And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,	999
	Still we went coupled and inseparable.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,	999
	Her very silence and her patience	999
	Speak to the people, and they pity her.	999
	Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;	999
	And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous	999
	When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:	999
	Firm and irrevocable is my doom	999
	Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.	999
	999
CELIA	Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:	999
	I cannot live out of her company.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:	999
	If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,	999
	And in the greatness of my word, you die.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords]	999
	999
CELIA	O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?	999
	Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.	999
	I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I have more cause.	999
	999
CELIA	                  Thou hast not, cousin;	999
	Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke	999
	Hath banish'd me, his daughter?	999
	999
ROSALIND	That he hath not.	999
	999
CELIA	No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love	999
	Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:	999
	Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?	999
	No: let my father seek another heir.	999
	Therefore devise with me how we may fly,	999
	Whither to go and what to bear with us;	999
	And do not seek to take your change upon you,	999
	To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;	999
	For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,	999
	Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Why, whither shall we go?	999
	999
CELIA	To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Alas, what danger will it be to us,	999
	Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!	999
	Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.	999
	999
CELIA	I'll put myself in poor and mean attire	999
	And with a kind of umber smirch my face;	999
	The like do you: so shall we pass along	999
	And never stir assailants.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Were it not better,	999
	Because that I am more than common tall,	999
	That I did suit me all points like a man?	999
	A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,	999
	A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart	999
	Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--	999
	We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,	999
	As many other mannish cowards have	999
	That do outface it with their semblances.	999
	999
CELIA	What shall I call thee when thou art a man?	999
	999
ROSALIND	I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;	999
	And therefore look you call me Ganymede.	999
	But what will you be call'd?	999
	999
CELIA	Something that hath a reference to my state	999
	No longer Celia, but Aliena.	999
	999
ROSALIND	But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal	999
	The clownish fool out of your father's court?	999
	Would he not be a comfort to our travel?	999
	999
CELIA	He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;	999
	Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,	999
	And get our jewels and our wealth together,	999
	Devise the fittest time and safest way	999
	To hide us from pursuit that will be made	999
	After my flight. Now go we in content	999
	To liberty and not to banishment.	999

ACT II	999

	999
SCENE I	The Forest of Arden.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords,	999
	like foresters]	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,	999
	Hath not old custom made this life more sweet	999
	Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods	999
	More free from peril than the envious court?	999
	Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,	999
	The seasons' difference, as the icy fang	999
	And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,	999
	Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,	999
	Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say	999
	'This is no flattery: these are counsellors	999
	That feelingly persuade me what I am.'	999
	Sweet are the uses of adversity,	999
	Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,	999
	Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;	999
	And this our life exempt from public haunt	999
	Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,	999
	Sermons in stones and good in every thing.	999
	I would not change it.	999
	999
AMIENS	Happy is your grace,	999
	That can translate the stubbornness of fortune	999
	Into so quiet and so sweet a style.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Come, shall we go and kill us venison?	999
	And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,	999
	Being native burghers of this desert city,	999
	Should in their own confines with forked heads	999
	Have their round haunches gored.	999
	999
First Lord	Indeed, my lord,	999
	The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,	999
	And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp	999
	Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.	999
	To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself	999
	Did steal behind him as he lay along	999
	Under an oak whose antique root peeps out	999
	Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:	999
	To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,	999
	That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,	999
	Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,	999
	The wretched animal heaved forth such groans	999
	That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat	999
	Almost to bursting, and the big round tears	999
	Coursed one another down his innocent nose	999
	In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool	999
	Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,	999
	Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,	999
	Augmenting it with tears.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	But what said Jaques?	999
	Did he not moralize this spectacle?	999
	999
First Lord	O, yes, into a thousand similes.	999
	First, for his weeping into the needless stream;	999
	'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament	999
	As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more	999
	To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,	999
	Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,	999
	''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part	999
	The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,	999
	Full of the pasture, jumps along by him	999
	And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,	999
	'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;	999
	'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look	999
	Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'	999
	Thus most invectively he pierceth through	999
	The body of the country, city, court,	999
	Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we	999
	Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,	999
	To fright the animals and to kill them up	999
	In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	And did you leave him in this contemplation?	999
	999
Second Lord	We did, my lord, weeping and commenting	999
	Upon the sobbing deer.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Show me the place:	999
	I love to cope him in these sullen fits,	999
	For then he's full of matter.	999
	999
First Lord	I'll bring you to him straight.	999

	999
DUKE FREDERICK	Can it be possible that no man saw them?	999
	It cannot be: some villains of my court	999
	Are of consent and sufferance in this.	999
	999
First Lord	I cannot hear of any that did see her.	999
	The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,	999
	Saw her abed, and in the morning early	999
	They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.	999
	999
Second Lord	My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft	999
	Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.	999
	Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,	999
	Confesses that she secretly o'erheard	999
	Your daughter and her cousin much commend	999
	The parts and graces of the wrestler	999
	That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;	999
	And she believes, wherever they are gone,	999
	That youth is surely in their company.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;	999
	If he be absent, bring his brother to me;	999
	I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,	999
	And let not search and inquisition quail	999

	999
ORLANDO	Who's there?	999
	999
ADAM	What, my young master? O, my gentle master!	999
	O my sweet master! O you memory	999
	Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?	999
	Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?	999
	And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?	999
	Why would you be so fond to overcome	999
	The bonny priser of the humorous duke?	999
	Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.	999
	Know you not, master, to some kind of men	999
	Their graces serve them but as enemies?	999
	No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,	999
	Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.	999
	O, what a world is this, when what is comely	999
	Envenoms him that bears it!	999
	999
ORLANDO	Why, what's the matter?	999
	999
ADAM	O unhappy youth!	999
	Come not within these doors; within this roof	999
	The enemy of all your graces lives:	999
	Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--	999
	Yet not the son, I will not call him son	999
	Of him I was about to call his father--	999
	Hath heard your praises, and this night he means	999
	To burn the lodging where you use to lie	999
	And you within it: if he fail of that,	999
	He will have other means to cut you off.	999
	I overheard him and his practises.	999
	This is no place; this house is but a butchery:	999
	Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?	999
	999
ADAM	No matter whither, so you come not here.	999
	999
ORLANDO	What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?	999
	Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce	999
	A thievish living on the common road?	999
	This I must do, or know not what to do:	999
	Yet this I will not do, do how I can;	999
	I rather will subject me to the malice	999
	Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.	999
	999
ADAM	But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,	999
	The thrifty hire I saved under your father,	999
	Which I did store to be my foster-nurse	999
	When service should in my old limbs lie lame	999
	And unregarded age in corners thrown:	999
	Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,	999
	Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,	999
	Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;	999
	And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:	999
	Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;	999
	For in my youth I never did apply	999
	Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,	999
	Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo	999
	The means of weakness and debility;	999
	Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,	999
	Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;	999
	I'll do the service of a younger man	999
	In all your business and necessities.	999
	999
ORLANDO	O good old man, how well in thee appears	999
	The constant service of the antique world,	999
	When service sweat for duty, not for meed!	999
	Thou art not for the fashion of these times,	999
	Where none will sweat but for promotion,	999
	And having that, do choke their service up	999
	Even with the having: it is not so with thee.	999
	But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,	999
	That cannot so much as a blossom yield	999
	In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry	999
	But come thy ways; well go along together,	999
	And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,	999
	We'll light upon some settled low content.	999
	999
ADAM	Master, go on, and I will follow thee,	999
	To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.	999
	From seventeen years till now almost fourscore	999
	Here lived I, but now live here no more.	999
	At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;	999
	But at fourscore it is too late a week:	999
	Yet fortune cannot recompense me better	999
	Than to die well and not my master's debtor.	999

	and TOUCHSTONE]	999
	999
ROSALIND	O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's	999
	apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort	999
	the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show	999
	itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,	999
	good Aliena!	999
	999
CELIA	I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear	999
	you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,	999
	for I think you have no money in your purse.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Well, this is the forest of Arden.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was	999
	at home, I was in a better place: but travellers	999
	must be content.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Ay, be so, good Touchstone.	999
	999
	[Enter CORIN and SILVIUS]	999
	999
	Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old in	999
	solemn talk.	999
	999
CORIN	That is the way to make her scorn you still.	999
	999
SILVIUS	O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!	999
	999
CORIN	I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.	999
	999
SILVIUS	No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,	999
	Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover	999
	As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:	999
	But if thy love were ever like to mine--	999
	As sure I think did never man love so--	999
	How many actions most ridiculous	999
	Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?	999
	999
CORIN	Into a thousand that I have forgotten.	999
	999
SILVIUS	O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!	999
	If thou remember'st not the slightest folly	999
	That ever love did make thee run into,	999
	Thou hast not loved:	999
	Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,	999
	Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,	999
	Thou hast not loved:	999
	Or if thou hast not broke from company	999
	Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,	999
	Thou hast not loved.	999
	O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ROSALIND	Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,	999
	I have by hard adventure found mine own.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke	999
	my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for	999
	coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the	999
	kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her	999
	pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the	999
	wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took	999
	two cods and, giving her them again, said with	999
	weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are	999
	true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is	999
	mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I	999
	break my shins against it.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion	999
	Is much upon my fashion.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	And mine; but it grows something stale with me.	999
	999
CELIA	I pray you, one of you question yond man	999
	If he for gold will give us any food:	999
	I faint almost to death.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Holla, you clown!	999
	999
ROSALIND	Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.	999
	999
CORIN	Who calls?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Your betters, sir.	999
	999
CORIN	                  Else are they very wretched.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.	999
	999
CORIN	And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold	999
	Can in this desert place buy entertainment,	999
	Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:	999
	Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd	999
	And faints for succor.	999
	999
CORIN	Fair sir, I pity her	999
	And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,	999
	My fortunes were more able to relieve her;	999
	But I am shepherd to another man	999
	And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:	999
	My master is of churlish disposition	999
	And little recks to find the way to heaven	999
	By doing deeds of hospitality:	999
	Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed	999
	Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,	999
	By reason of his absence, there is nothing	999
	That you will feed on; but what is, come see.	999
	And in my voice most welcome shall you be.	999
	999
ROSALIND	What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?	999
	999
CORIN	That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,	999
	That little cares for buying any thing.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,	999
	Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,	999
	And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.	999
	999
CELIA	And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.	999
	And willingly could waste my time in it.	999
	999
CORIN	Assuredly the thing is to be sold:	999
	Go with me: if you like upon report	999
	The soil, the profit and this kind of life,	999
	I will your very faithful feeder be	999
	And buy it with your gold right suddenly.	999

	Unto the sweet bird's throat,	999
	Come hither, come hither, come hither:	999
	Here shall he see No enemy	999
	But winter and rough weather.	999
	999
JAQUES	More, more, I prithee, more.	999
	999
AMIENS	It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.	999
	999
JAQUES	I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck	999
	melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.	999
	More, I prithee, more.	999
	999
AMIENS	My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.	999
	999
JAQUES	I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to	999
	sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?	999
	999
AMIENS	What you will, Monsieur Jaques.	999
	999
JAQUES	Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me	999
	nothing. Will you sing?	999
	999
AMIENS	More at your request than to please myself.	999
	999
JAQUES	Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;	999
	but that they call compliment is like the encounter	999
	of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,	999
	methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me	999
	the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will	999
	not, hold your tongues.	999
	999
AMIENS	Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the	999
	duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all	999
	this day to look you.	999
	999
JAQUES	And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is	999
	too disputable for my company: I think of as many	999
	matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no	999
	boast of them. Come, warble, come.	999

	Here shall he see No enemy	999

	999
JAQUES	I'll give you a verse to this note that I made	999
	yesterday in despite of my invention.	999

AMIENS	And I'll sing it.	999

JAQUES	Thus it goes:--	999

	That any man turn ass,	999
	Leaving his wealth and ease,	999
	A stubborn will to please,	999
	Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:	999
	Here shall he see	999
	Gross fools as he,	999
	An if he will come to me.	999
	999
AMIENS	What's that 'ducdame'?	999
	999
JAQUES	'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a	999
	circle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll	999

	If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I	999
	will either be food for it or bring it for food to	999
	thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.	999
	For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at	999
	the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;	999
	and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will	999
	give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I	999
	come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!	999
	thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.	999
	Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear	999

DUKE SENIOR	Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,	999
	That your poor friends must woo your company?	999
	What, you look merrily!	999
	999
JAQUES	A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,	999
	A motley fool; a miserable world!	999
	As I do live by food, I met a fool	999
	Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,	999
	And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,	999
	In good set terms and yet a motley fool.	999
	'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,	999
	'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'	999
	And then he drew a dial from his poke,	999
	And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,	999
	Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:	999
	Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:	999
	'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,	999
	And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;	999
	And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,	999
	And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;	999
	And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear	999
	The motley fool thus moral on the time,	999
	My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,	999
	That fools should be so deep-contemplative,	999
	And I did laugh sans intermission	999
	An hour by his dial. O noble fool!	999
	A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	What fool is this?	999
	999
JAQUES	O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,	999
	And says, if ladies be but young and fair,	999
	They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,	999
	Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit	999
	After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd	999
	With observation, the which he vents	999
	In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!	999
	I am ambitious for a motley coat.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Thou shalt have one.	999
	999
JAQUES	It is my only suit;	999
	Provided that you weed your better judgments	999
	Of all opinion that grows rank in them	999
	That I am wise. I must have liberty	999
	Withal, as large a charter as the wind,	999
	To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;	999
	And they that are most galled with my folly,	999
	They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?	999
	The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:	999
	He that a fool doth very wisely hit	999
	Doth very foolishly, although he smart,	999
	Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,	999
	The wise man's folly is anatomized	999
	Even by the squandering glances of the fool.	999
	Invest me in my motley; give me leave	999
	To speak my mind, and I will through and through	999
	Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,	999
	If they will patiently receive my medicine.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.	999
	999
JAQUES	What, for a counter, would I do but good?	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:	999
	For thou thyself hast been a libertine,	999
	As sensual as the brutish sting itself;	999
	And all the embossed sores and headed evils,	999
	That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,	999
	Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.	999
	999
JAQUES	Why, who cries out on pride,	999
	That can therein tax any private party?	999
	Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,	999
	Till that the weary very means do ebb?	999
	What woman in the city do I name,	999
	When that I say the city-woman bears	999
	The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?	999
	Who can come in and say that I mean her,	999
	When such a one as she such is her neighbour?	999
	Or what is he of basest function	999
	That says his bravery is not of my cost,	999
	Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits	999
	His folly to the mettle of my speech?	999
	There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein	999
	My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,	999
	Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,	999
	Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,	999
	Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn]	999
	999
ORLANDO	Forbear, and eat no more.	999
	999
JAQUES	Why, I have eat none yet.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.	999
	999
JAQUES	Of what kind should this cock come of?	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,	999
	Or else a rude despiser of good manners,	999
	That in civility thou seem'st so empty?	999
	999
ORLANDO	You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point	999
	Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show	999
	Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred	999
	And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:	999
	He dies that touches any of this fruit	999
	Till I and my affairs are answered.	999
	999
JAQUES	An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	What would you have? Your gentleness shall force	999
	More than your force move us to gentleness.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I almost die for food; and let me have it.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:	999
	I thought that all things had been savage here;	999
	And therefore put I on the countenance	999
	Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are	999
	That in this desert inaccessible,	999
	Under the shade of melancholy boughs,	999
	Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time	999
	If ever you have look'd on better days,	999
	If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,	999
	If ever sat at any good man's feast,	999
	If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear	999
	And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,	999
	Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:	999
	In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	True is it that we have seen better days,	999
	And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church	999
	And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes	999
	Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:	999
	And therefore sit you down in gentleness	999
	And take upon command what help we have	999
	That to your wanting may be minister'd.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Then but forbear your food a little while,	999
	Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn	999
	And give it food. There is an old poor man,	999
	Who after me hath many a weary step	999
	Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,	999
	Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,	999
	I will not touch a bit.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Go find him out,	999
	And we will nothing waste till you return.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:	999
	This wide and universal theatre	999
	Presents more woeful pageants than the scene	999
	Wherein we play in.	999
	999
JAQUES	All the world's a stage,	999
	And all the men and women merely players:	999
	They have their exits and their entrances;	999
	And one man in his time plays many parts,	999
	His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,	999
	Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.	999
	And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel	999
	And shining morning face, creeping like snail	999
	Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,	999
	Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad	999
	Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,	999
	Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,	999
	Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,	999
	Seeking the bubble reputation	999
	Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,	999
	In fair round belly with good capon lined,	999
	With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,	999
	Full of wise saws and modern instances;	999
	And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts	999
	Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,	999
	With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,	999
	His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide	999
	For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,	999
	Turning again toward childish treble, pipes	999
	And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,	999
	That ends this strange eventful history,	999
	Is second childishness and mere oblivion,	999
	Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.	999
	999
	[Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM]	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,	999
	And let him feed.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I thank you most for him.	999
	999
ADAM	So had you need:	999
	I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you	999
	As yet, to question you about your fortunes.	999
	Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.	999
		999
	SONG.	999
AMIENS	Blow, blow, thou winter wind.	999
	Thou art not so unkind	999
	As man's ingratitude;	999
	Thy tooth is not so keen,	999
	Because thou art not seen,	999
	Although thy breath be rude.	999
	Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:	999
	Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:	999
	Then, heigh-ho, the holly!	999
	This life is most jolly.	999
	Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,	999
	That dost not bite so nigh	999
	As benefits forgot:	999
	Though thou the waters warp,	999
	Thy sting is not so sharp	999
	As friend remember'd not.	999
	Heigh-ho! sing, &c.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,	999
	As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,	999
	And as mine eye doth his effigies witness	999
	Most truly limn'd and living in your face,	999
	Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke	999
	That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,	999
	Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,	999
	Thou art right welcome as thy master is.	999
	Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,	999
	And let me all your fortunes understand.	999

	999
	[Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVER]	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:	999
	But were I not the better part made mercy,	999
	I should not seek an absent argument	999
	Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:	999
	Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;	999
	Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living	999
	Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more	999
	To seek a living in our territory.	999
	Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine	999
	Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,	999
	Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth	999
	Of what we think against thee.	999
	999
OLIVER	O that your highness knew my heart in this!	999
	I never loved my brother in my life.	999
	999
DUKE FREDERICK	More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;	999
	And let my officers of such a nature	999
	Make an extent upon his house and lands:	999
	Do this expediently and turn him going.	999

SCENE II	The forest.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ORLANDO, with a paper]	999
	999
ORLANDO	Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:	999
	And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey	999
	With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,	999
	Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.	999
	O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books	999
	And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;	999
	That every eye which in this forest looks	999
	Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.	999
	Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree	999
	The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE]	999
	999
CORIN	And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good	999
	life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,	999
	it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I	999
	like it very well; but in respect that it is	999
	private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it	999
	is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in	999
	respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As	999
	is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;	999
	but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much	999
	against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?	999
	999
CORIN	No more but that I know the more one sickens the	999
	worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,	999
	means and content is without three good friends;	999
	that the property of rain is to wet and fire to	999
	burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a	999
	great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that	999
	he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may	999
	complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in	999
	court, shepherd?	999
	999
CORIN	No, truly.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Then thou art damned.	999
	999
CORIN	Nay, I hope.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all	999
	on one side.	999
	999
CORIN	For not being at court? Your reason.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest	999
	good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,	999
	then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is	999
	sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous	999
	state, shepherd.	999
	999
CORIN	Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners	999
	at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the	999
	behavior of the country is most mockable at the	999
	court. You told me you salute not at the court, but	999
	you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be	999
	uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Instance, briefly; come, instance.	999
	999
CORIN	Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their	999
	fells, you know, are greasy.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not	999
	the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of	999
	a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.	999
	999
CORIN	Besides, our hands are hard.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.	999
	A more sounder instance, come.	999
	999
CORIN	And they are often tarred over with the surgery of	999
	our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The	999
	courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a	999
	good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and	999
	perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the	999
	very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.	999
	999
CORIN	You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!	999
	God make incision in thee! thou art raw.	999
	999
CORIN	Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get	999
	that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's	999
	happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my	999
	harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes	999
	graze and my lambs suck.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes	999
	and the rams together and to offer to get your	999
	living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a	999
	bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a	999
	twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,	999
	out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not	999
	damned for this, the devil himself will have no	999
	shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst	999
	'scape.	999
	999
CORIN	Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.	999
	999
	[Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading]	999
	999
ROSALIND	     From the east to western Ind,	999
	No jewel is like Rosalind.	999
	Her worth, being mounted on the wind,	999
	Through all the world bears Rosalind.	999
	All the pictures fairest lined	999
	Are but black to Rosalind.	999
	Let no fair be kept in mind	999
	But the fair of Rosalind.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and	999
	suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the	999
	right butter-women's rank to market.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Out, fool!	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	For a taste:	999
	If a hart do lack a hind,	999
	Let him seek out Rosalind.	999
	If the cat will after kind,	999
	So be sure will Rosalind.	999
	Winter garments must be lined,	999
	So must slender Rosalind.	999
	They that reap must sheaf and bind;	999
	Then to cart with Rosalind.	999
	Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,	999
	Such a nut is Rosalind.	999
	He that sweetest rose will find	999
	Must find love's prick and Rosalind.	999
	This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you	999
	infect yourself with them?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it	999
	with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit	999
	i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half	999
	ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the	999
	forest judge.	999
	999
	[Enter CELIA, with a writing]	999
	999
ROSALIND	Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.	999
	999
CELIA	[Reads]	999
	999
	Why should this a desert be?	999
	For it is unpeopled? No:	999
	Tongues I'll hang on every tree,	999
	That shall civil sayings show:	999
	Some, how brief the life of man	999
	Runs his erring pilgrimage,	999
	That the stretching of a span	999
	Buckles in his sum of age;	999
	Some, of violated vows	999
	'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:	999
	But upon the fairest boughs,	999
	Or at every sentence end,	999
	Will I Rosalinda write,	999
	Teaching all that read to know	999
	The quintessence of every sprite	999
	Heaven would in little show.	999
	Therefore Heaven Nature charged	999
	That one body should be fill'd	999
	With all graces wide-enlarged:	999
	Nature presently distill'd	999
	Helen's cheek, but not her heart,	999
	Cleopatra's majesty,	999
	Atalanta's better part,	999
	Sad Lucretia's modesty.	999
	Thus Rosalind of many parts	999
	By heavenly synod was devised,	999
	Of many faces, eyes and hearts,	999
	To have the touches dearest prized.	999
	Heaven would that she these gifts should have,	999
	And I to live and die her slave.	999
	999
ROSALIND	O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love	999
	have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never	999
	cried 'Have patience, good people!'	999
	999
CELIA	How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.	999
	Go with him, sirrah.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;	999
	though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.	999
	999
	[Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE]	999
	999
CELIA	Didst thou hear these verses?	999
	999
ROSALIND	O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of	999
	them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.	999
	999
CELIA	That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear	999
	themselves without the verse and therefore stood	999
	lamely in the verse.	999
	999
CELIA	But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name	999
	should be hanged and carved upon these trees?	999
	999
ROSALIND	I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder	999
	before you came; for look here what I found on a	999
	palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since	999
	Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I	999
	can hardly remember.	999
	999
CELIA	Trow you who hath done this?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Is it a man?	999
	999
CELIA	And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.	999
	Change you colour?	999
	999
ROSALIND	I prithee, who?	999
	999
CELIA	O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to	999
	meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes	999
	and so encounter.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Nay, but who is it?	999
	999
CELIA	Is it possible?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,	999
	tell me who it is.	999
	999
CELIA	O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful	999
	wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,	999
	out of all hooping!	999
	999
ROSALIND	Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am	999
	caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in	999
	my disposition? One inch of delay more is a	999
	South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it	999
	quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst	999
	stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man	999
	out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-	999
	mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at	999
	all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that	999
	may drink thy tidings.	999
	999
CELIA	So you may put a man in your belly.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his	999
	head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?	999
	999
CELIA	Nay, he hath but a little beard.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Why, God will send more, if the man will be	999
	thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if	999
	thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.	999
	999
CELIA	It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's	999
	heels and your heart both in an instant.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and	999
	true maid.	999
	999
CELIA	I' faith, coz, 'tis he.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Orlando?	999
	999
CELIA	Orlando.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and	999
	hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said	999
	he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes	999
	him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?	999
	How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see	999
	him again? Answer me in one word.	999
	999
CELIA	You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a	999
	word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To	999
	say ay and no to these particulars is more than to	999
	answer in a catechism.	999
	999
ROSALIND	But doth he know that I am in this forest and in	999
	man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the	999
	day he wrestled?	999
	999
CELIA	It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the	999
	propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my	999
	finding him, and relish it with good observance.	999
	I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.	999
	999
ROSALIND	It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops	999
	forth such fruit.	999
	999
CELIA	Give me audience, good madam.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Proceed.	999
	999
CELIA	There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well	999
	becomes the ground.	999
	999
CELIA	Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets	999
	unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.	999
	999
ROSALIND	O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.	999
	999
CELIA	I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest	999
	me out of tune.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must	999
	speak. Sweet, say on.	999
	999
CELIA	You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?	999
	999
	[Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES]	999
	999
ROSALIND	'Tis he: slink by, and note him.	999
	999
JAQUES	I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had	999
	as lief have been myself alone.	999
	999
ORLANDO	And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you	999
	too for your society.	999
	999
JAQUES	God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I do desire we may be better strangers.	999
	999
JAQUES	I pray you, mar no more trees with writing	999
	love-songs in their barks.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading	999
	them ill-favouredly.	999
	999
JAQUES	Rosalind is your love's name?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Yes, just.	999
	999
JAQUES	I do not like her name.	999
	999
ORLANDO	There was no thought of pleasing you when she was	999
	christened.	999
	999
JAQUES	What stature is she of?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Just as high as my heart.	999
	999
JAQUES	You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been	999
	acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them	999
	out of rings?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from	999
	whence you have studied your questions.	999
	999
JAQUES	You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of	999
	Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and	999
	we two will rail against our mistress the world and	999
	all our misery.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I will chide no breather in the world but myself,	999
	against whom I know most faults.	999
	999
JAQUES	The worst fault you have is to be in love.	999
	999
ORLANDO	'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.	999
	I am weary of you.	999
	999
JAQUES	By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found	999
	you.	999
	999
ORLANDO	He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you	999
	shall see him.	999
	999
JAQUES	There I shall see mine own figure.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.	999
	999
JAQUES	I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good	999
	Signior Love.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur	999
	Melancholy.	999
	999
	[Exit JAQUES]	999
	999
ROSALIND	[Aside to CELIA]  I will speak to him, like a saucy	999
	lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.	999
	Do you hear, forester?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Very well: what would you?	999
	999
ROSALIND	I pray you, what is't o'clock?	999
	999
ORLANDO	You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock	999
	in the forest.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Then there is no true lover in the forest; else	999
	sighing every minute and groaning every hour would	999
	detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.	999
	999
ORLANDO	And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that	999
	been as proper?	999
	999
ROSALIND	By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with	999
	divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles	999
	withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops	999
	withal and who he stands still withal.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I prithee, who doth he trot withal?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the	999
	contract of her marriage and the day it is	999
	solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,	999
	Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of	999
	seven year.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Who ambles Time withal?	999
	999
ROSALIND	With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that	999
	hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because	999
	he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because	999
	he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean	999
	and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden	999
	of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Who doth he gallop withal?	999
	999
ROSALIND	With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as	999
	softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Who stays it still withal?	999
	999
ROSALIND	With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between	999
	term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Where dwell you, pretty youth?	999
	999
ROSALIND	With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the	999
	skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Are you native of this place?	999
	999
ROSALIND	As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Your accent is something finer than you could	999
	purchase in so removed a dwelling.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I have been told so of many: but indeed an old	999
	religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was	999
	in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship	999
	too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard	999
	him read many lectures against it, and I thank God	999
	I am not a woman, to be touched with so many	999
	giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their	999
	whole sex withal.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Can you remember any of the principal evils that he	999
	laid to the charge of women?	999
	999
ROSALIND	There were none principal; they were all like one	999
	another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming	999
	monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I prithee, recount some of them.	999
	999
ROSALIND	No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that	999
	are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that	999
	abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on	999
	their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies	999
	on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of	999
	Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would	999
	give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the	999
	quotidian of love upon him.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me	999
	your remedy.	999
	999
ROSALIND	There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he	999
	taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage	999
	of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.	999
	999
ORLANDO	What were his marks?	999
	999
ROSALIND	A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and	999
	sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable	999
	spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,	999
	which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for	999
	simply your having in beard is a younger brother's	999
	revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your	999
	bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe	999
	untied and every thing about you demonstrating a	999
	careless desolation; but you are no such man; you	999
	are rather point-device in your accoutrements as	999
	loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you	999
	love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to	999
	do than to confess she does: that is one of the	999
	points in the which women still give the lie to	999
	their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he	999
	that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind	999
	is so admired?	999
	999
ORLANDO	I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of	999
	Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.	999
	999
ROSALIND	But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves	999
	as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and	999
	the reason why they are not so punished and cured	999
	is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers	999
	are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Did you ever cure any so?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me	999
	his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to	999
	woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish	999
	youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing	999
	and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,	999
	inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every	999
	passion something and for no passion truly any	999
	thing, as boys and women are for the most part	999
	cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe	999
	him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep	999
	for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor	999
	from his mad humour of love to a living humour of	999
	madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of	999
	the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.	999
	And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon	999
	me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's	999
	heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I would not be cured, youth.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind	999
	and come every day to my cote and woo me.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me	999
	where it is.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way	999
	you shall tell me where in the forest you live.	999
	Will you go?	999
	999
ORLANDO	With all my heart, good youth.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?	999

SCENE III	The forest.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind]	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your	999
	goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?	999
	doth my simple feature content you?	999
	999
AUDREY	Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most	999
	capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.	999
	999
JAQUES	[Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove	999
	in a thatched house!	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a	999
	man's good wit seconded with the forward child	999
	Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a	999
	great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would	999
	the gods had made thee poetical.	999
	999
AUDREY	I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in	999
	deed and word? is it a true thing?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most	999
	feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what	999
	they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.	999
	999
AUDREY	Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art	999
	honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some	999
	hope thou didst feign.	999
	999
AUDREY	Would you not have me honest?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for	999
	honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.	999
	999
JAQUES	[Aside]  A material fool!	999
	999
AUDREY	 Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods	999
	make me honest.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut	999
	were to put good meat into an unclean dish.	999
	999
AUDREY	I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!	999
	sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may	999
	be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been	999
	with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next	999
	village, who hath promised to meet me in this place	999
	of the forest and to couple us.	999
	999
JAQUES	[Aside]  I would fain see this meeting.	999
	999
AUDREY	Well, the gods give us joy!	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,	999
	stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple	999
	but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what	999
	though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are	999
	necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of	999
	his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and	999
	knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of	999
	his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?	999
	Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer	999
	hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man	999
	therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more	999
	worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a	999
	married man more honourable than the bare brow of a	999
	bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no	999
	skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to	999
	want. Here comes Sir Oliver.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT]	999
	999
	Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you	999
	dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go	999
	with you to your chapel?	999
	999
SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	Is there none here to give the woman?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	I will not take her on gift of any man.	999
	999
SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.	999
	999
JAQUES	[Advancing]	999
	999
	Proceed, proceed	I'll give her.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,	999
	sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your	999
	last company: I am very glad to see you: even a	999
	toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.	999
	999
JAQUES	Will you be married, motley?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and	999
	the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and	999
	as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.	999
	999
JAQUES	And will you, being a man of your breeding, be	999
	married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to	999
	church, and have a good priest that can tell you	999
	what marriage is: this fellow will but join you	999
	together as they join wainscot; then one of you will	999
	prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	[Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to be	999
	married of him than of another: for he is not like	999
	to marry me well; and not being well married, it	999
	will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.	999
	999
JAQUES	Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	'Come, sweet Audrey:	999
	We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.	999
	Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--	999
	O sweet Oliver,	999
	O brave Oliver,	999
	Leave me not behind thee: but,--	999
	Wind away,	999
	Begone, I say,	999
	I will not to wedding with thee.	999
	999

SCENE IV	The forest.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ROSALIND and CELIA]	999
	999
ROSALIND	Never talk to me; I will weep.	999
	999
CELIA	Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider	999
	that tears do not become a man.	999
	999
ROSALIND	But have I not cause to weep?	999
	999
CELIA	As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.	999
	999
ROSALIND	His very hair is of the dissembling colour.	999
	999
CELIA	Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are	999
	Judas's own children.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.	999
	999
CELIA	An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.	999
	999
ROSALIND	And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch	999
	of holy bread.	999
	999
CELIA	He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun	999
	of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;	999
	the very ice of chastity is in them.	999
	999
ROSALIND	But why did he swear he would come this morning, and	999
	comes not?	999
	999
CELIA	Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Do you think so?	999
	999
CELIA	Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a	999
	horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do	999
	think him as concave as a covered goblet or a	999
	worm-eaten nut.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Not true in love?	999
	999
CELIA	Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.	999
	999
ROSALIND	You have heard him swear downright he was.	999
	999
CELIA	'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is	999
	no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are	999
	both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends	999
	here in the forest on the duke your father.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I met the duke yesterday and had much question with	999
	him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told	999
	him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.	999
	But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a	999
	man as Orlando?	999
	999
CELIA	O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,	999
	speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks	999
	them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of	999
	his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse	999
	but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble	999
	goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly	999
	guides. Who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter CORIN]	999
	999
CORIN	Mistress and master, you have oft inquired	999
	After the shepherd that complain'd of love,	999
	Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,	999
	Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess	999
	That was his mistress.	999
	999
CELIA	Well, and what of him?	999
	999
CORIN	If you will see a pageant truly play'd,	999
	Between the pale complexion of true love	999
	And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,	999
	Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,	999
	If you will mark it.	999
	999
ROSALIND	O, come, let us remove:	999
	The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.	999
	Bring us to this sight, and you shall say	999
	I'll prove a busy actor in their play.	999

SCENE V	Another part of the forest.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE]	999
	999
SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;	999
	Say that you love me not, but say not so	999
	In bitterness. The common executioner,	999
	Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,	999
	Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck	999
	But first begs pardon: will you sterner be	999
	Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?	999
	999
	[Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind]	999
	999
PHEBE	I would not be thy executioner:	999
	I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.	999
	Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:	999
	'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,	999
	That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,	999
	Who shut their coward gates on atomies,	999
	Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!	999
	Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;	999
	And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:	999
	Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;	999
	Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,	999
	Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!	999
	Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:	999
	Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains	999
	Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,	999
	The cicatrice and capable impressure	999
	Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,	999
	Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,	999
	Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes	999
	That can do hurt.	999
	999
SILVIUS	                  O dear Phebe,	999
	If ever,--as that ever may be near,--	999
	You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,	999
	Then shall you know the wounds invisible	999
	That love's keen arrows make.	999
	999
PHEBE	But till that time	999
	Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,	999
	Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;	999
	As till that time I shall not pity thee.	999
	999
ROSALIND	And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,	999
	That you insult, exult, and all at once,	999
	Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--	999
	As, by my faith, I see no more in you	999
	Than without candle may go dark to bed--	999
	Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?	999
	Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?	999
	I see no more in you than in the ordinary	999
	Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,	999
	I think she means to tangle my eyes too!	999
	No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:	999
	'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,	999
	Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,	999
	That can entame my spirits to your worship.	999
	You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,	999
	Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?	999
	You are a thousand times a properer man	999
	Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you	999
	That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:	999
	'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;	999
	And out of you she sees herself more proper	999
	Than any of her lineaments can show her.	999
	But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,	999
	And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:	999
	For I must tell you friendly in your ear,	999
	Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:	999
	Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:	999
	Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.	999
	So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.	999
	999
PHEBE	Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:	999
	I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.	999
	999
ROSALIND	He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll	999
	fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as	999
	she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her	999
	with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?	999
	999
PHEBE	For no ill will I bear you.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I pray you, do not fall in love with me,	999
	For I am falser than vows made in wine:	999
	Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,	999
	'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.	999
	Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.	999
	Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,	999
	And be not proud: though all the world could see,	999
	None could be so abused in sight as he.	999
	Come, to our flock.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN]	999
	999
PHEBE	Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,	999
	'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'	999
	999
SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe,--	999
	999
PHEBE	                  Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?	999
	999
SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe, pity me.	999
	999
PHEBE	Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.	999
	999
SILVIUS	Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:	999
	If you do sorrow at my grief in love,	999
	By giving love your sorrow and my grief	999
	Were both extermined.	999
	999
PHEBE	Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?	999
	999
SILVIUS	I would have you.	999
	999
PHEBE	                  Why, that were covetousness.	999
	Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,	999
	And yet it is not that I bear thee love;	999
	But since that thou canst talk of love so well,	999
	Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,	999
	I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:	999
	But do not look for further recompense	999
	Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.	999
	999
SILVIUS	So holy and so perfect is my love,	999
	And I in such a poverty of grace,	999
	That I shall think it a most plenteous crop	999
	To glean the broken ears after the man	999
	That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then	999
	A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.	999
	999
PHEBE	Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?	999
	999
SILVIUS	Not very well, but I have met him oft;	999
	And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds	999
	That the old carlot once was master of.	999
	999
PHEBE	Think not I love him, though I ask for him:	999
	'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;	999
	But what care I for words? yet words do well	999
	When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.	999
	It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:	999
	But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:	999
	He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him	999
	Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue	999
	Did make offence his eye did heal it up.	999
	He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:	999
	His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:	999
	There was a pretty redness in his lip,	999
	A little riper and more lusty red	999
	Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference	999
	Between the constant red and mingled damask.	999
	There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him	999
	In parcels as I did, would have gone near	999
	To fall in love with him; but, for my part,	999
	I love him not nor hate him not; and yet	999
	I have more cause to hate him than to love him:	999
	For what had he to do to chide at me?	999
	He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:	999
	And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:	999
	I marvel why I answer'd not again:	999
	But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.	999
	I'll write to him a very taunting letter,	999
	And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?	999
	999
SILVIUS	Phebe, with all my heart.	999
	999
PHEBE	I'll write it straight;	999
	The matter's in my head and in my heart:	999
	I will be bitter with him and passing short.	999
	Go with me, Silvius.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The forest.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES]	999
	999
JAQUES	I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted	999
	with thee.	999
	999
ROSALIND	They say you are a melancholy fellow.	999
	999
JAQUES	I am so; I do love it better than laughing.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Those that are in extremity of either are abominable	999
	fellows and betray themselves to every modern	999
	censure worse than drunkards.	999
	999
JAQUES	Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Why then, 'tis good to be a post.	999
	999
JAQUES	I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is	999
	emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,	999
	nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the	999
	soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,	999
	which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor	999
	the lover's, which is all these: but it is a	999
	melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,	999
	extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's	999
	contemplation of my travels, in which my often	999
	rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.	999
	999
ROSALIND	A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to	999
	be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see	999
	other men's; then, to have seen much and to have	999
	nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.	999
	999
JAQUES	Yes, I have gained my experience.	999
	999
ROSALIND	And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have	999
	a fool to make me merry than experience to make me	999
	sad; and to travel for it too!	999
	999
	[Enter ORLANDO]	999
	999
ORLANDO	Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!	999
	999
JAQUES	Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ROSALIND	Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and	999
	wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your	999
	own country, be out of love with your nativity and	999
	almost chide God for making you that countenance you	999
	are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a	999
	gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been	999
	all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such	999
	another trick, never come in my sight more.	999
	999
ORLANDO	My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Break an hour's promise in love! He that will	999
	divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but	999
	a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the	999
	affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid	999
	hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant	999
	him heart-whole.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Pardon me, dear Rosalind.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I	999
	had as lief be wooed of a snail.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Of a snail?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he	999
	carries his house on his head; a better jointure,	999
	I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings	999
	his destiny with him.	999
	999
ORLANDO	What's that?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be	999
	beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in	999
	his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.	999
	999
ROSALIND	And I am your Rosalind.	999
	999
CELIA	It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a	999
	Rosalind of a better leer than you.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday	999
	humour and like enough to consent. What would you	999
	say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?	999
	999
ORLANDO	I would kiss before I spoke.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were	999
	gravelled for lack of matter, you might take	999
	occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are	999
	out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God	999
	warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.	999
	999
ORLANDO	How if the kiss be denied?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or	999
	I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.	999
	999
ORLANDO	What, of my suit?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.	999
	Am not I your Rosalind?	999
	999
ORLANDO	I take some joy to say you are, because I would be	999
	talking of her.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Well in her person I say I will not have you.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Then in mine own person I die.	999
	999
ROSALIND	No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is	999
	almost six thousand years old, and in all this time	999
	there was not any man died in his own person,	999
	videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains	999
	dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he	999
	could to die before, and he is one of the patterns	999
	of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair	999
	year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been	999
	for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went	999
	but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being	999
	taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish	999
	coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'	999
	But these are all lies: men have died from time to	999
	time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,	999
	for, I protest, her frown might kill me.	999
	999
ROSALIND	By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now	999
	I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on	999
	disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant	999
	it.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Then love me, Rosalind.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.	999
	999
ORLANDO	And wilt thou have me?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Ay, and twenty such.	999
	999
ORLANDO	What sayest thou?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Are you not good?	999
	999
ORLANDO	I hope so.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?	999
	Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.	999
	Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Pray thee, marry us.	999
	999
CELIA	I cannot say the words.	999
	999
ROSALIND	You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'	999
	999
CELIA	Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?	999
	999
ORLANDO	I will.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Ay, but when?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Why now; as fast as she can marry us.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'	999
	999
ORLANDO	I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I might ask you for your commission; but I do take	999
	thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes	999
	before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought	999
	runs before her actions.	999
	999
ORLANDO	So do all thoughts; they are winged.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Now tell me how long you would have her after you	999
	have possessed her.	999
	999
ORLANDO	For ever and a day.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;	999
	men are April when they woo, December when they wed:	999
	maids are May when they are maids, but the sky	999
	changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous	999
	of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,	999
	more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more	999
	new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires	999
	than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana	999
	in the fountain, and I will do that when you are	999
	disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and	999
	that when thou art inclined to sleep.	999
	999
ORLANDO	But will my Rosalind do so?	999
	999
ROSALIND	By my life, she will do as I do.	999
	999
ORLANDO	O, but she is wise.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the	999
	wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's	999
	wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and	999
	'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly	999
	with the smoke out at the chimney.	999
	999
ORLANDO	A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say	999
	'Wit, whither wilt?'	999
	999
ROSALIND	Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met	999
	your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.	999
	999
ORLANDO	And what wit could wit have to excuse that?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall	999
	never take her without her answer, unless you take	999
	her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot	999
	make her fault her husband's occasion, let her	999
	never nurse her child herself, for she will breed	999
	it like a fool!	999
	999
ORLANDO	For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.	999
	999
ORLANDO	I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I	999
	will be with thee again.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you	999
	would prove: my friends told me as much, and I	999
	thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours	999
	won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,	999
	death! Two o'clock is your hour?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Ay, sweet Rosalind.	999
	999
ROSALIND	By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend	999
	me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,	999
	if you break one jot of your promise or come one	999
	minute behind your hour, I will think you the most	999
	pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover	999
	and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that	999
	may be chosen out of the gross band of the	999
	unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep	999
	your promise.	999
	999
ORLANDO	With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my	999
	Rosalind: so adieu.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such	999
	offenders, and let Time try: adieu.	999
	999
	[Exit ORLANDO]	999
	999
CELIA	You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:	999
	we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your	999
	head, and show the world what the bird hath done to	999
	her own nest.	999
	999
ROSALIND	O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou	999
	didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But	999
	it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown	999
	bottom, like the bay of Portugal.	999
	999
CELIA	Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour	999
	affection in, it runs out.	999
	999
ROSALIND	No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot	999
	of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,	999
	that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes	999
	because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I	999
	am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out	999
	of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and	999
	sigh till he come.	999
	999
CELIA	And I'll sleep.	999

SCENE II	The forest.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter JAQUES, Lords, and Foresters]	999
	999
JAQUES	Which is he that killed the deer?	999
	999
A Lord	Sir, it was I.	999
	999
JAQUES	Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman	999
	conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's	999
	horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have	999
	you no song, forester, for this purpose?	999
	999
Forester	Yes, sir.	999
	999
JAQUES	Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it	999
	make noise enough.	999
		999
	SONG.	999
Forester	What shall he have that kill'd the deer?	999
	His leather skin and horns to wear.	999
	Then sing him home;	999
	999
	[The rest shall bear this burden]	999
	999
	Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;	999
	It was a crest ere thou wast born:	999
	Thy father's father wore it,	999
	And thy father bore it:	999
	The horn, the horn, the lusty horn	999
	Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.	999

SCENE III	The forest.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ROSALIND and CELIA]	999
	999
ROSALIND	How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and	999
	here much Orlando!	999
	999
CELIA	I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he	999
	hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to	999
	sleep. Look, who comes here.	999
	999
	[Enter SILVIUS]	999
	999
SILVIUS	My errand is to you, fair youth;	999
	My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:	999
	I know not the contents; but, as I guess	999
	By the stern brow and waspish action	999
	Which she did use as she was writing of it,	999
	It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:	999
	I am but as a guiltless messenger.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Patience herself would startle at this letter	999
	And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:	999
	She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;	999
	She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,	999
	Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!	999
	Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:	999
	Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,	999
	This is a letter of your own device.	999
	999
SILVIUS	No, I protest, I know not the contents:	999
	Phebe did write it.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Come, come, you are a fool	999
	And turn'd into the extremity of love.	999
	I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.	999
	A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think	999
	That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:	999
	She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:	999
	I say she never did invent this letter;	999
	This is a man's invention and his hand.	999
	999
SILVIUS	Sure, it is hers.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.	999
	A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,	999
	Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain	999
	Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention	999
	Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect	999
	Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?	999
	999
SILVIUS	So please you, for I never heard it yet;	999
	Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.	999
	999
ROSALIND	She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,	999
	That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?	999
	Can a woman rail thus?	999
	999
SILVIUS	Call you this railing?	999
	999
ROSALIND	[Reads]	999
	999
	Why, thy godhead laid apart,	999
	Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?	999
	Did you ever hear such railing?	999
	Whiles the eye of man did woo me,	999
	That could do no vengeance to me.	999
	Meaning me a beast.	999
	If the scorn of your bright eyne	999
	Have power to raise such love in mine,	999
	Alack, in me what strange effect	999
	Would they work in mild aspect!	999
	Whiles you chid me, I did love;	999
	How then might your prayers move!	999
	He that brings this love to thee	999
	Little knows this love in me:	999
	And by him seal up thy mind;	999
	Whether that thy youth and kind	999
	Will the faithful offer take	999
	Of me and all that I can make;	999
	Or else by him my love deny,	999
	And then I'll study how to die.	999
	999
SILVIUS	Call you this chiding?	999
	999
CELIA	Alas, poor shepherd!	999
	999
ROSALIND	Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt	999
	thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an	999
	instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to	999
	be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see	999
	love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to	999
	her: that if she love me, I charge her to love	999
	thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless	999
	thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,	999
	hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.	999
	999
	[Exit SILVIUS]	999
	999
	[Enter OLIVER]	999
	999
OLIVER	Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,	999
	Where in the purlieus of this forest stands	999
	A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?	999
	999
CELIA	West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:	999
	The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream	999
	Left on your right hand brings you to the place.	999
	But at this hour the house doth keep itself;	999
	There's none within.	999
	999
OLIVER	If that an eye may profit by a tongue,	999
	Then should I know you by description;	999
	Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,	999
	Of female favour, and bestows himself	999
	Like a ripe sister: the woman low	999
	And browner than her brother.' Are not you	999
	The owner of the house I did inquire for?	999
	999
CELIA	It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.	999
	999
OLIVER	Orlando doth commend him to you both,	999
	And to that youth he calls his Rosalind	999
	He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?	999
	999
ROSALIND	I am: what must we understand by this?	999
	999
OLIVER	Some of my shame; if you will know of me	999
	What man I am, and how, and why, and where	999
	This handkercher was stain'd.	999
	999
CELIA	I pray you, tell it.	999
	999
OLIVER	When last the young Orlando parted from you	999
	He left a promise to return again	999
	Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,	999
	Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,	999
	Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,	999
	And mark what object did present itself:	999
	Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age	999
	And high top bald with dry antiquity,	999
	A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,	999
	Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck	999
	A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,	999
	Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd	999
	The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,	999
	Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,	999
	And with indented glides did slip away	999
	Into a bush: under which bush's shade	999
	A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,	999
	Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,	999
	When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis	999
	The royal disposition of that beast	999
	To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:	999
	This seen, Orlando did approach the man	999
	And found it was his brother, his elder brother.	999
	999
CELIA	O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;	999
	And he did render him the most unnatural	999
	That lived amongst men.	999
	999
OLIVER	And well he might so do,	999
	For well I know he was unnatural.	999
	999
ROSALIND	But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,	999
	Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?	999
	999
OLIVER	Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;	999
	But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,	999
	And nature, stronger than his just occasion,	999
	Made him give battle to the lioness,	999
	Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling	999
	From miserable slumber I awaked.	999
	999
CELIA	Are you his brother?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Wast you he rescued?	999
	999
CELIA	Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?	999
	999
OLIVER	'Twas I; but 'tis not I	I do not shame	999
	To tell you what I was, since my conversion	999
	So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.	999
	999
ROSALIND	But, for the bloody napkin?	999
	999
OLIVER	By and by.	999
	When from the first to last betwixt us two	999
	Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,	999
	As how I came into that desert place:--	999
	In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,	999
	Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,	999
	Committing me unto my brother's love;	999
	Who led me instantly unto his cave,	999
	There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm	999
	The lioness had torn some flesh away,	999
	Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted	999
	And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.	999
	Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;	999
	And, after some small space, being strong at heart,	999
	He sent me hither, stranger as I am,	999
	To tell this story, that you might excuse	999
	His broken promise, and to give this napkin	999
	Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth	999
	That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.	999
	999
	[ROSALIND swoons]	999
	999
CELIA	Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!	999
	999
OLIVER	Many will swoon when they do look on blood.	999
	999
CELIA	There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!	999
	999
OLIVER	Look, he recovers.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I would I were at home.	999
	999
CELIA	We'll lead you thither.	999
	I pray you, will you take him by the arm?	999
	999
OLIVER	Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a	999
	man's heart.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would	999
	think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell	999
	your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!	999
	999
OLIVER	This was not counterfeit: there is too great	999
	testimony in your complexion that it was a passion	999
	of earnest.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Counterfeit, I assure you.	999
	999
OLIVER	Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.	999
	999
ROSALIND	So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.	999
	999
CELIA	Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw	999
	homewards. Good sir, go with us.	999
	999
OLIVER	That will I, for I must bear answer back	999
	How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I shall devise something: but, I pray you, commend	999
	my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?	999

AUDREY	Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old	999
	gentleman's saying.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile	999
	Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the	999
	forest lays claim to you.	999
	999
AUDREY	Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in	999
	the world: here comes the man you mean.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	It is meat and drink to me to see a clown: by my	999
	troth, we that have good wits have much to answer	999
	for; we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.	999
	999
	[Enter WILLIAM]	999
	999
WILLIAM	Good even, Audrey.	999
	999
AUDREY	God ye good even, William.	999
	999
WILLIAM	And good even to you, sir.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Good even, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy	999
	head; nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?	999
	999
WILLIAM	Five and twenty, sir.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	A ripe age. Is thy name William?	999
	999
WILLIAM	William, sir.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	A fair name. Wast born i' the forest here?	999
	999
WILLIAM	Ay, sir, I thank God.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	'Thank God;' a good answer. Art rich?	999
	999
WILLIAM	Faith, sir, so so.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and	999
	yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?	999
	999
WILLIAM	Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,	999
	'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man	999
	knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen	999
	philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,	999
	would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;	999
	meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and	999
	lips to open. You do love this maid?	999
	999
WILLIAM	I do, sir.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Give me your hand. Art thou learned?	999
	999
WILLIAM	No, sir.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it	999
	is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out	999
	of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty	999
	the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse	999
	is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.	999
	999
WILLIAM	Which he, sir?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you	999
	clown, abandon,--which is in the vulgar leave,--the	999
	society,--which in the boorish is company,--of this	999
	female,--which in the common is woman; which	999
	together is, abandon the society of this female, or,	999
	clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better	999
	understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make	999
	thee away, translate thy life into death, thy	999
	liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with	999
	thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy	999
	with thee in faction; I will o'errun thee with	999
	policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways:	999
	therefore tremble and depart.	999
	999

	999
	999
	[Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER]	999
	999
ORLANDO	Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you	999
	should like her? that but seeing you should love	999
	her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should	999
	grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?	999
	999
OLIVER	Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the	999
	poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden	999
	wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me,	999
	I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;	999
	consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it	999
	shall be to your good; for my father's house and all	999
	the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I	999
	estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.	999
	999
ORLANDO	You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow:	999
	thither will I invite the duke and all's contented	999
	followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for look	999
	you, here comes my Rosalind.	999
	999
	[Enter ROSALIND]	999

ROSALIND	God save you, brother.	999
	999
OLIVER	And you, fair sister.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ROSALIND	O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee	999
	wear thy heart in a scarf!	999
	999
ORLANDO	It is my arm.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws	999
	of a lion.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to	999
	swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?	999
	999
ORLANDO	Ay, and greater wonders than that.	999
	999
ROSALIND	O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was	999
	never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams	999
	and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and	999
	overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner	999
	met but they looked, no sooner looked but they	999
	loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner	999
	sighed but they asked one another the reason, no	999
	sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;	999
	and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs	999
	to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or	999
	else be incontinent before marriage: they are in	999
	the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs	999
	cannot part them.	999
	999
ORLANDO	They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the	999
	duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it	999
	is to look into happiness through another man's	999
	eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at	999
	the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall	999
	think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?	999
	999
ORLANDO	I can live no longer by thinking.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.	999
	Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,	999
	that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I	999
	speak not this that you should bear a good opinion	999
	of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;	999
	neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in	999
	some little measure draw a belief from you, to do	999
	yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if	999
	you please, that I can do strange things: I have,	999
	since I was three year old, conversed with a	999
	magician, most profound in his art and yet not	999
	damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart	999
	as your gesture cries it out, when your brother	999
	marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into	999
	what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is	999
	not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient	999
	to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human	999
	as she is and without any danger.	999
	999
ORLANDO	Speakest thou in sober meanings?	999
	999
ROSALIND	By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I	999
	say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your	999
	best array: bid your friends; for if you will be	999
	married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.	999
	999
	[Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE]	999
	999
	Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.	999
	999
PHEBE	Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,	999
	To show the letter that I writ to you.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I care not if I have: it is my study	999
	To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:	999
	You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;	999
	Look upon him, love him; he worships you.	999
	999
PHEBE	Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.	999
	999
SILVIUS	It is to be all made of sighs and tears;	999
	And so am I for Phebe.	999
	999

ORLANDO	And so am I for Rosalind.	999

SILVIUS	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?	999
	999
ORLANDO	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?	999
	999
ROSALIND	Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'	999
	999
ORLANDO	To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.	999
	999
ROSALIND	Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling	999
	of Irish wolves against the moon.	999
	999

	999
	I will help you, if I can:	999

TOUCHSTONE	To-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey; to-morrow will	999
	we be married.	999
	999
AUDREY	I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is	999
	no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the	999
	world. Here comes two of the banished duke's pages.	999
	999
	[Enter two Pages]	999
	999
First Page	Well met, honest gentleman.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.	999
	999
Second Page	We are for you: sit i' the middle.	999
	999
First Page	Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking or	999
	spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only	999
	prologues to a bad voice?	999
	999
Second Page	I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two	999
	gipsies on a horse.	999
		999
	SONG.	999
	It was a lover and his lass,	999
	With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,	999
	That o'er the green corn-field did pass	999
	In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,	999
	When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:	999
	Sweet lovers love the spring.	999
	999
	Between the acres of the rye,	999
	With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino	999
	These pretty country folks would lie,	999
	In spring time, &c.	999
	999
	This carol they began that hour,	999
	With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,	999
	How that a life was but a flower	999
	In spring time, &c.	999
	999
	And therefore take the present time,	999
	With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;	999
	For love is crowned with the prime	999
	In spring time, &c.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great	999
	matter in the ditty, yet the note was very	999
	untuneable.	999
	999
First Page	You are deceived, sir: we kept time, we lost not our time.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear	999
	such a foolish song. God be wi' you; and God mend	999
	your voices! Come, Audrey.	999

	[Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER,	999
	and CELIA]	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy	999
	Can do all this that he hath promised?	999
	999
ORLANDO	I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;	999
	As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.	999
	999
	[Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE]	999
	999
ROSALIND	Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:	999
	You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,	999
	You will bestow her on Orlando here?	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.	999
	999
ROSALIND	And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?	999
	999
ORLANDO	That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.	999
	999
ROSALIND	You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?	999
	999
PHEBE	That will I, should I die the hour after.	999
	999
ROSALIND	But if you do refuse to marry me,	999
	You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?	999
	999
PHEBE	So is the bargain.	999
	999
ROSALIND	You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?	999
	999
SILVIUS	Though to have her and death were both one thing.	999
	999
ROSALIND	I have promised to make all this matter even.	999
	Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;	999
	You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:	999
	Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,	999
	Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:	999
	Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her.	999
	If she refuse me: and from hence I go,	999
	To make these doubts all even.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA]	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	I do remember in this shepherd boy	999
	Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.	999
	999
ORLANDO	My lord, the first time that I ever saw him	999
	Methought he was a brother to your daughter:	999
	But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,	999
	And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments	999
	Of many desperate studies by his uncle,	999
	Whom he reports to be a great magician,	999
	Obscured in the circle of this forest.	999
	999
	[Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY]	999
	999
JAQUES	There is, sure, another flood toward, and these	999
	couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of	999
	very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Salutation and greeting to you all!	999
	999
JAQUES	Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the	999
	motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in	999
	the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	If any man doubt that, let him put me to my	999
	purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered	999
	a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth	999
	with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have	999
	had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.	999
	999
JAQUES	And how was that ta'en up?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the	999
	seventh cause.	999
	999
JAQUES	How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	I like him very well.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I	999
	press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country	999
	copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as	999
	marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,	999
	sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor	999
	humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else	999
	will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a	999
	poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.	999
	999
JAQUES	But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the	999
	quarrel on the seventh cause?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more	999
	seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the	999
	cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,	999
	if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the	999
	mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.	999
	If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he	999
	would send me word, he cut it to please himself:	999
	this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was	999
	not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is	999
	called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not	999
	well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this	999
	is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not	999
	well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the	999
	Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie	999
	Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.	999
	999
JAQUES	And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,	999
	nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we	999
	measured swords and parted.	999
	999
JAQUES	Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?	999
	999
TOUCHSTONE	O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have	999
	books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.	999
	The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the	999
	Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the	999
	fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the	999
	Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with	999
	Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All	999
	these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may	999
	avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven	999
	justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the	999
	parties were met themselves, one of them thought but	999
	of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and	999
	they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the	999
	only peacemaker; much virtue in If.	999
	999
JAQUES	Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at	999
	any thing and yet a fool.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under	999
	the presentation of that he shoots his wit.	999

	Yea, brought her hither,	999
	That thou mightst join her hand with his	999
	Whose heart within his bosom is.	999
	999
ROSALIND	[To DUKE SENIOR]  To you I give myself, for I am yours.	999
	999
	[To ORLANDO]	999

	999
PHEBE	If sight and shape be true,	999
	Why then, my love adieu!	999
	999
ROSALIND	I'll have no father, if you be not he:	999
	I'll have no husband, if you be not he:	999
	Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.	999
	999
HYMEN	        Peace, ho! I bar confusion:	999
	'Tis I must make conclusion	999
	Of these most strange events:	999
	Here's eight that must take hands	999
	To join in Hymen's bands,	999
	If truth holds true contents.	999
	You and you no cross shall part:	999
	You and you are heart in heart	999
	You to his love must accord,	999
	Or have a woman to your lord:	999
	You and you are sure together,	999
	As the winter to foul weather.	999
	Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,	999

		999
	SONG.	999
	Wedding is great Juno's crown:	999

	High wedlock then be honoured:	999
	Honour, high honour and renown,	999
	To Hymen, god of every town!	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!	999
	Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.	999
	999
PHEBE	I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;	999
	Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.	999
	999
	[Enter JAQUES DE BOYS]	999
	999
JAQUES DE BOYS	Let me have audience for a word or two:	999
	I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,	999
	That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.	999
	Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day	999
	Men of great worth resorted to this forest,	999
	Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,	999
	In his own conduct, purposely to take	999
	His brother here and put him to the sword:	999
	And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;	999
	Where meeting with an old religious man,	999
	After some question with him, was converted	999
	Both from his enterprise and from the world,	999
	His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,	999
	And all their lands restored to them again	999
	That were with him exiled. This to be true,	999
	I do engage my life.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Welcome, young man;	999
	Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:	999
	To one his lands withheld, and to the other	999
	A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.	999
	First, in this forest, let us do those ends	999
	That here were well begun and well begot:	999
	And after, every of this happy number	999
	That have endured shrewd days and nights with us	999
	Shall share the good of our returned fortune,	999
	According to the measure of their states.	999
	Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity	999
	And fall into our rustic revelry.	999
	Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,	999
	With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.	999
	999
JAQUES	Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,	999
	The duke hath put on a religious life	999
	And thrown into neglect the pompous court?	999
	999
JAQUES DE BOYS	He hath.	999
	999
JAQUES	To him will I : out of these convertites	999
	There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.	999
	999
	[To DUKE SENIOR]	999
	999
	You to your former honour I bequeath;	999
	Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:	999
	999
	[To ORLANDO]	999
	999
	You to a love that your true faith doth merit:	999
	999
	[To OLIVER]	999
	999
	You to your land and love and great allies:	999
	999
	[To SILVIUS]	999
	999
	You to a long and well-deserved bed:	999
	999
	[To TOUCHSTONE]	999
	999
	And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage	999
	Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:	999
	I am for other than for dancing measures.	999
	999
DUKE SENIOR	Stay, Jaques, stay.	999
	999
JAQUES	To see no pastime I	what you would have	999
	I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999

	AS YOU LIKE IT	999
	999
	EPILOGUE	999
	999
	999
ROSALIND	It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;	999
	but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord	999
	the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs	999
	no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no	999
	epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,	999
	and good plays prove the better by the help of good	999
	epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am	999
	neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with	999
	you in the behalf of a good play! I am not	999
	furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not	999
	become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin	999
	with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love	999
	you bear to men, to like as much of this play as	999
	please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love	999
	you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,	999
	none of you hates them--that between you and the	999
	women the play may please. If I were a woman I	999
	would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased	999
	me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I	999
	defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good	999
	beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my	999
	kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other	999
	Attendants]	999
	999
AEGEON	Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall	999
	And by the doom of death end woes and all.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;	999
	I am not partial to infringe our laws:	999
	The enmity and discord which of late	999
	Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke	999
	To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,	999
	Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives	999
	Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,	999
	Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.	999
	For, since the mortal and intestine jars	999
	'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,	999
	It hath in solemn synods been decreed	999
	Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,	999
	To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,	999
	If any born at Ephesus be seen	999
	At any Syracusian marts and fairs;	999
	Again: if any Syracusian born	999
	Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,	999
	His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,	999
	Unless a thousand marks be levied,	999
	To quit the penalty and to ransom him.	999
	Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,	999
	Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;	999
	Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.	999
	999
AEGEON	Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,	999
	My woes end likewise with the evening sun.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause	999
	Why thou departed'st from thy native home	999
	And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.	999
	999
AEGEON	A heavier task could not have been imposed	999
	Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:	999
	Yet, that the world may witness that my end	999
	Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,	999
	I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.	999
	In Syracusa was I born, and wed	999
	Unto a woman, happy but for me,	999
	And by me, had not our hap been bad.	999
	With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased	999
	By prosperous voyages I often made	999
	To Epidamnum; till my factor's death	999
	And the great care of goods at random left	999
	Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:	999
	From whom my absence was not six months old	999
	Before herself, almost at fainting under	999
	The pleasing punishment that women bear,	999
	Had made provision for her following me	999
	And soon and safe arrived where I was.	999
	There had she not been long, but she became	999
	A joyful mother of two goodly sons;	999
	And, which was strange, the one so like the other,	999
	As could not be distinguish'd but by names.	999
	That very hour, and in the self-same inn,	999
	A meaner woman was delivered	999
	Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:	999
	Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--	999
	I bought and brought up to attend my sons.	999
	My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,	999
	Made daily motions for our home return:	999
	Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,	999
	We came aboard.	999
	A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,	999
	Before the always wind-obeying deep	999
	Gave any tragic instance of our harm:	999
	But longer did we not retain much hope;	999
	For what obscured light the heavens did grant	999
	Did but convey unto our fearful minds	999
	A doubtful warrant of immediate death;	999
	Which though myself would gladly have embraced,	999
	Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,	999
	Weeping before for what she saw must come,	999
	And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,	999
	That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,	999
	Forced me to seek delays for them and me.	999
	And this it was, for other means was none:	999
	The sailors sought for safety by our boat,	999
	And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:	999
	My wife, more careful for the latter-born,	999
	Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,	999
	Such as seafaring men provide for storms;	999
	To him one of the other twins was bound,	999
	Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:	999
	The children thus disposed, my wife and I,	999
	Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,	999
	Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;	999
	And floating straight, obedient to the stream,	999
	Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.	999
	At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,	999
	Dispersed those vapours that offended us;	999
	And by the benefit of his wished light,	999
	The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered	999
	Two ships from far making amain to us,	999
	Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:	999
	But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!	999
	Gather the sequel by that went before.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;	999
	For we may pity, though not pardon thee.	999
	999
AEGEON	O, had the gods done so, I had not now	999
	Worthily term'd them merciless to us!	999
	For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,	999
	We were encounterd by a mighty rock;	999
	Which being violently borne upon,	999
	Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;	999
	So that, in this unjust divorce of us,	999
	Fortune had left to both of us alike	999
	What to delight in, what to sorrow for.	999
	Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened	999
	With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,	999
	Was carried with more speed before the wind;	999
	And in our sight they three were taken up	999
	By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.	999
	At length, another ship had seized on us;	999
	And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,	999
	Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;	999
	And would have reft the fishers of their prey,	999
	Had not their bark been very slow of sail;	999
	And therefore homeward did they bend their course.	999
	Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;	999
	That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,	999
	To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,	999
	Do me the favour to dilate at full	999
	What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.	999
	999
AEGEON	My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,	999
	At eighteen years became inquisitive	999
	After his brother: and importuned me	999
	That his attendant--so his case was like,	999
	Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--	999
	Might bear him company in the quest of him:	999
	Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,	999
	I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.	999
	Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,	999
	Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,	999
	And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;	999
	Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought	999
	Or that or any place that harbours men.	999
	But here must end the story of my life;	999
	And happy were I in my timely death,	999
	Could all my travels warrant me they live.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd	999
	To bear the extremity of dire mishap!	999
	Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,	999
	Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,	999
	Which princes, would they, may not disannul,	999
	My soul would sue as advocate for thee.	999
	But, though thou art adjudged to the death	999
	And passed sentence may not be recall'd	999
	But to our honour's great disparagement,	999
	Yet I will favour thee in what I can.	999
	Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day	999
	To seek thy life by beneficial help:	999
	Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;	999
	Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,	999
	And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.	999
	Gaoler, take him to thy custody.	999
	999
Gaoler	I will, my lord.	999
	999
AEGEON	Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,	999
	But to procrastinate his lifeless end.	999

	999
	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse,	999
	and First Merchant]	999
	999
First Merchant	Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,	999
	Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.	999
	This very day a Syracusian merchant	999
	Is apprehended for arrival here;	999
	And not being able to buy out his life	999
	According to the statute of the town,	999
	Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.	999
	There is your money that I had to keep.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,	999
	And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.	999
	Within this hour it will be dinner-time:	999
	Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,	999
	Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,	999
	And then return and sleep within mine inn,	999
	For with long travel I am stiff and weary.	999
	Get thee away.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Many a man would take you at your word,	999
	And go indeed, having so good a mean.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,	999
	When I am dull with care and melancholy,	999
	Lightens my humour with his merry jests.	999
	What, will you walk with me about the town,	999
	And then go to my inn and dine with me?	999
	999
First Merchant	I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,	999
	Of whom I hope to make much benefit;	999
	I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,	999
	Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart	999
	And afterward consort you till bed-time:	999
	My present business calls me from you now.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Farewell till then: I will go lose myself	999
	And wander up and down to view the city.	999
	999
First Merchant	Sir, I commend you to your own content.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	He that commends me to mine own content	999
	Commends me to the thing I cannot get.	999
	I to the world am like a drop of water	999
	That in the ocean seeks another drop,	999
	Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,	999
	Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:	999
	So I, to find a mother and a brother,	999
	In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.	999
	999
	[Enter DROMIO of Ephesus]	999
	999
	Here comes the almanac of my true date.	999
	What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:	999
	The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,	999
	The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;	999
	My mistress made it one upon my cheek:	999
	She is so hot because the meat is cold;	999
	The meat is cold because you come not home;	999
	You come not home because you have no stomach;	999
	You have no stomach having broke your fast;	999
	But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray	999
	Are penitent for your default to-day.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:	999
	Where have you left the money that I gave you?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last	999
	To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?	999
	The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	I am not in a sportive humour now:	999
	Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?	999
	We being strangers here, how darest thou trust	999
	So great a charge from thine own custody?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:	999
	I from my mistress come to you in post;	999
	If I return, I shall be post indeed,	999
	For she will score your fault upon my pate.	999
	Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,	999
	And strike you home without a messenger.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;	999
	Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.	999
	Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,	999
	And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	My charge was but to fetch you from the mart	999
	Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:	999
	My mistress and her sister stays for you.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,	999
	Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours	999
	That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:	999
	Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I have some marks of yours upon my pate,	999
	Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,	999
	But not a thousand marks between you both.	999
	If I should pay your worship those again,	999
	Perchance you will not bear them patiently.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?	999
	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;	999
	She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,	999
	And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,	999
	Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!	999
	Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Upon my life, by some device or other	999
	The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.	999
	They say this town is full of cozenage,	999
	As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,	999
	Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,	999
	Soul-killing witches that deform the body,	999
	Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,	999
	And many such-like liberties of sin:	999
	If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.	999
	I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:	999
	I greatly fear my money is not safe.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA]	999
	999
ADRIANA	Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,	999
	That in such haste I sent to seek his master!	999
	Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,	999
	And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.	999
	Good sister, let us dine and never fret:	999
	A man is master of his liberty:	999
	Time is their master, and, when they see time,	999
	They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Why should their liberty than ours be more?	999
	999
LUCIANA	Because their business still lies out o' door.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.	999
	999
LUCIANA	O, know he is the bridle of your will.	999
	999
ADRIANA	There's none but asses will be bridled so.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.	999
	There's nothing situate under heaven's eye	999
	But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:	999
	The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,	999
	Are their males' subjects and at their controls:	999
	Men, more divine, the masters of all these,	999
	Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,	999
	Indued with intellectual sense and souls,	999
	Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,	999
	Are masters to their females, and their lords:	999
	Then let your will attend on their accords.	999
	999
ADRIANA	This servitude makes you to keep unwed.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.	999
	999
ADRIANA	But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.	999
	999
ADRIANA	How if your husband start some other where?	999
	999
LUCIANA	Till he come home again, I would forbear.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;	999
	They can be meek that have no other cause.	999
	A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,	999
	We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;	999
	But were we burdened with like weight of pain,	999
	As much or more would we ourselves complain:	999
	So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,	999
	With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,	999
	But, if thou live to see like right bereft,	999
	This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Well, I will marry one day, but to try.	999
	Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.	999
	999
	[Enter DROMIO of Ephesus]	999
	999
ADRIANA	Say, is your tardy master now at hand?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears	999
	can witness.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:	999
	Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his	999
	blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce	999
	understand them.	999
	999
ADRIANA	But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he	999
	hath great care to please his wife.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Horn-mad, thou villain!	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I mean not cuckold-mad;	999
	But, sure, he is stark mad.	999
	When I desired him to come home to dinner,	999
	He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:	999
	''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;	999
	'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:	999
	'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.	999
	'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'	999
	'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:	999
	'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!	999
	I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'	999
	999
LUCIANA	Quoth who?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Quoth my master:	999
	'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'	999
	So that my errand, due unto my tongue,	999
	I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;	999
	For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Go back again, and be new beaten home?	999
	For God's sake, send some other messenger.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	And he will bless that cross with other beating:	999
	Between you I shall have a holy head.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Am I so round with you as you with me,	999
	That like a football you do spurn me thus?	999
	You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:	999
	If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LUCIANA	Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!	999
	999
ADRIANA	His company must do his minions grace,	999
	Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.	999
	Hath homely age the alluring beauty took	999
	From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:	999
	Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?	999
	If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,	999
	Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:	999
	Do their gay vestments his affections bait?	999
	That's not my fault: he's master of my state:	999
	What ruins are in me that can be found,	999
	By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground	999
	Of my defeatures. My decayed fair	999
	A sunny look of his would soon repair	999
	But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale	999
	And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!	999
	999
ADRIANA	Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.	999
	I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,	999
	Or else what lets it but he would be here?	999
	Sister, you know he promised me a chain;	999
	Would that alone, alone he would detain,	999
	So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!	999
	I see the jewel best enamelled	999
	Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,	999
	That others touch, and often touching will	999
	Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,	999
	By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.	999
	Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,	999
	I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.	999
	999
LUCIANA	How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!	999

ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up	999
	Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave	999
	Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out	999
	By computation and mine host's report.	999
	I could not speak with Dromio since at first	999
	I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.	999
	999
	[Enter DROMIO of Syracuse]	999
	999
	How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?	999
	As you love strokes, so jest with me again.	999
	You know no Centaur? you received no gold?	999
	Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?	999
	My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,	999
	That thus so madly thou didst answer me?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Even now, even here, not half an hour since.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I did not see you since you sent me hence,	999
	Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,	999
	And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;	999
	For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I am glad to see you in this merry vein:	999
	What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?	999
	Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.	999
	999
	[Beating him]	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:	999
	Upon what bargain do you give it me?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Because that I familiarly sometimes	999
	Do use you for my fool and chat with you,	999
	Your sauciness will jest upon my love	999
	And make a common of my serious hours.	999
	When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,	999
	But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.	999
	If you will jest with me, know my aspect,	999
	And fashion your demeanor to my looks,	999
	Or I will beat this method in your sconce.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I	999
	had rather have it a head: an you use these blows	999
	long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce	999
	it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.	999
	But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Dost thou not know?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Shall I tell you why?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath	999
	a wherefore.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--	999
	For urging it the second time to me.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,	999
	When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme	999
	nor reason?	999
	Well, sir, I thank you.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Thank me, sir, for what?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for	999
	something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	In good time, sir; what's that?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Basting.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Your reason?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another	999
	dry basting.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a	999
	time for all things.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	By what rule, sir?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald	999
	pate of father Time himself.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Let's hear it.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	There's no time for a man to recover his hair that	999
	grows bald by nature.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	May he not do it by fine and recovery?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the	999
	lost hair of another man.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,	999
	so plentiful an excrement?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;	999
	and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth	999
	it in a kind of jollity.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	For what reason?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	For two; and sound ones too.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Nay, not sound, I pray you.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Sure ones, then.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Certain ones then.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Name them.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	The one, to save the money that he spends in	999
	trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not	999
	drop in his porridge.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	You would all this time have proved there is no	999
	time for all things.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair	999
	lost by nature.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	But your reason was not substantial, why there is no	999
	time to recover.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore	999
	to the world's end will have bald followers.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:	999
	But, soft! who wafts us yonder?	999
	999
	[Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA]	999
	999
ADRIANA	Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:	999
	Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;	999
	I am not Adriana nor thy wife.	999
	The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow	999
	That never words were music to thine ear,	999
	That never object pleasing in thine eye,	999
	That never touch well welcome to thy hand,	999
	That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,	999
	Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.	999
	How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,	999
	That thou art thus estranged from thyself?	999
	Thyself I call it, being strange to me,	999
	That, undividable, incorporate,	999
	Am better than thy dear self's better part.	999
	Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!	999
	For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall	999
	A drop of water in the breaking gulf,	999
	And take unmingled that same drop again,	999
	Without addition or diminishing,	999
	As take from me thyself and not me too.	999
	How dearly would it touch me to the quick,	999
	Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious	999
	And that this body, consecrate to thee,	999
	By ruffian lust should be contaminate!	999
	Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me	999
	And hurl the name of husband in my face	999
	And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow	999
	And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring	999
	And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?	999
	I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.	999
	I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;	999
	My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:	999
	For if we too be one and thou play false,	999
	I do digest the poison of thy flesh,	999
	Being strumpeted by thy contagion.	999
	Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;	999
	I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:	999
	In Ephesus I am but two hours old,	999
	As strange unto your town as to your talk;	999
	Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,	999
	Want wit in all one word to understand.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!	999
	When were you wont to use my sister thus?	999
	She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	By Dromio?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	By me?	999
	999
ADRIANA	By thee; and this thou didst return from him,	999
	That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,	999
	Denied my house for his, me for his wife.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?	999
	What is the course and drift of your compact?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I, sir? I never saw her till this time.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Villain, thou liest; for even her very words	999
	Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I never spake with her in all my life.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	How can she thus then call us by our names,	999
	Unless it be by inspiration.	999
	999
ADRIANA	How ill agrees it with your gravity	999
	To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,	999
	Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!	999
	Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,	999
	But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.	999
	Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:	999
	Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,	999
	Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,	999
	Makes me with thy strength to communicate:	999
	If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,	999
	Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;	999
	Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion	999
	Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:	999
	What, was I married to her in my dream?	999
	Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?	999
	What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?	999
	Until I know this sure uncertainty,	999
	I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.	999
	This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!	999
	We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:	999
	If we obey them not, this will ensue,	999
	They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?	999
	Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I am transformed, master, am I not?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	I think thou art in mind, and so am I.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Thou hast thine own form.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No, I am an ape.	999
	999
LUCIANA	If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.	999
	'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be	999
	But I should know her as well as she knows me.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,	999
	To put the finger in the eye and weep,	999
	Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.	999
	Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.	999
	Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day	999
	And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.	999
	Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,	999
	Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.	999
	Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?	999
	Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?	999
	Known unto these, and to myself disguised!	999
	I'll say as they say and persever so,	999
	And in this mist at all adventures go.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, shall I be porter at the gate?	999
	999
ADRIANA	Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

	THE COMEDY OF ERRORS	999
	999
	999
ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus,	999
	ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR]	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;	999
	My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:	999
	Say that I linger'd with you at your shop	999
	To see the making of her carcanet,	999
	And that to-morrow you will bring it home.	999
	But here's a villain that would face me down	999
	He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,	999
	And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,	999
	And that I did deny my wife and house.	999
	Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;	999
	That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:	999
	If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,	999
	Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	I think thou art an ass.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Marry, so it doth appear	999
	By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.	999
	I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,	999
	You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer	999
	May answer my good will and your good welcome here.	999
	999
BALTHAZAR	I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your	999
	welcome dear.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,	999
	A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.	999
	999
BALTHAZAR	Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.	999
	999
BALTHAZAR	Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:	999
	But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;	999
	Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.	999
	But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,	999
	idiot, patch!	999
	Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.	999
	Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st	999
	for such store,	999
	When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	What patch is made our porter? My master stays in	999
	the street.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  Let him walk from whence he came, lest he	999
	catch cold on's feet.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Who talks within there? ho, open the door!	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tell	999
	me wherefore.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  Nor to-day here you must not; come again	999
	when you may.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  The porter for this time, sir, and my name	999
	is Dromio.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.	999
	The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.	999
	If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,	999
	Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy	999
	name for an ass.	999
	999
LUCE	[Within]  What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those	999
	at the gate?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Let my master in, Luce.	999
	999
LUCE	[Within]  Faith, no; he comes too late;	999
	And so tell your master.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	O Lord, I must laugh!	999
	Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?	999
	999
LUCE	[Within]  Have at you with another; that's--When?	999
	can you tell?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast	999
	answered him well.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?	999
OF EPHESUS	999
	999
LUCE	[Within]  I thought to have asked you.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  And you said no.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Thou baggage, let me in.	999
	999
LUCE	[Within]  Can you tell for whose sake?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Master, knock the door hard.	999
	999
LUCE	[Within]  Let him knock till it ache.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.	999
	999
LUCE	[Within]  What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?	999
	999
ADRIANA	[Within]  Who is that at the door that keeps all	999
	this noise?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  By my troth, your town is troubled with	999
	unruly boys.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Are you there, wife? you might have come before.	999
	999
ADRIANA	[Within]  Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.	999
	999
ANGELO	Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would	999
	fain have either.	999
	999
BALTHAZAR	In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.	999
	Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:	999
	It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  Break any breaking here, and I'll break your	999
	knave's pate.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,	999
	Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon	999
	thee, hind!	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,	999
	let me in.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?	999
	For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;	999
	If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.	999
	999
BALTHAZAR	Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!	999
	Herein you war against your reputation	999
	And draw within the compass of suspect	999
	The unviolated honour of your wife.	999
	Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,	999
	Her sober virtue, years and modesty,	999
	Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:	999
	And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse	999
	Why at this time the doors are made against you.	999
	Be ruled by me: depart in patience,	999
	And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,	999
	And about evening come yourself alone	999
	To know the reason of this strange restraint.	999
	If by strong hand you offer to break in	999
	Now in the stirring passage of the day,	999
	A vulgar comment will be made of it,	999
	And that supposed by the common rout	999
	Against your yet ungalled estimation	999
	That may with foul intrusion enter in	999
	And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;	999
	For slander lives upon succession,	999
	For ever housed where it gets possession.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,	999
	And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.	999
	I know a wench of excellent discourse,	999
	Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:	999
	There will we dine. This woman that I mean,	999
	My wife--but, I protest, without desert--	999
	Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:	999
	To her will we to dinner.	999
	999
	[To Angelo]	999
	999
		    Get you home	999
	And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:	999
	Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;	999
	For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--	999
	Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--	999
	Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.	999
	Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,	999
	I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.	999
	999
ANGELO	I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.	999

SCENE II	The same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse]	999
	999
LUCIANA	And may it be that you have quite forgot	999
	A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.	999
	Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?	999
	Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?	999
	If you did wed my sister for her wealth,	999
	Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:	999
	Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;	999
	Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:	999
	Let not my sister read it in your eye;	999
	Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;	999
	Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;	999
	Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;	999
	Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;	999
	Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;	999
	Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?	999
	What simple thief brags of his own attaint?	999
	'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed	999
	And let her read it in thy looks at board:	999
	Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;	999
	Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.	999
	Alas, poor women! make us but believe,	999
	Being compact of credit, that you love us;	999
	Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;	999
	We in your motion turn and you may move us.	999
	Then, gentle brother, get you in again;	999
	Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:	999
	'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,	999
	When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,	999
	Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--	999
	Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not	999
	Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.	999
	Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;	999
	Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,	999
	Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,	999
	The folded meaning of your words' deceit.	999
	Against my soul's pure truth why labour you	999
	To make it wander in an unknown field?	999
	Are you a god? would you create me new?	999
	Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.	999
	But if that I am I, then well I know	999
	Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,	999
	Nor to her bed no homage do I owe	999
	Far more, far more to you do I decline.	999
	O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,	999
	To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:	999
	Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:	999
	Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,	999
	And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,	999
	And in that glorious supposition think	999
	He gains by death that hath such means to die:	999
	Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!	999
	999
LUCIANA	What, are you mad, that you do reason so?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.	999
	999
LUCIANA	It is a fault that springeth from your eye.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.	999
	999
	999
LUCIANA	Why call you me love? call my sister so.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Thy sister's sister.	999
	999
	999
LUCIANA	That's my sister.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	No;	999
	It is thyself, mine own self's better part,	999
	Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,	999
	My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,	999
	My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.	999
	999
LUCIANA	All this my sister is, or else should be.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.	999
	Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:	999
	Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.	999
	Give me thy hand.	999
	999
LUCIANA	                  O, soft, air! hold you still:	999
	I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter DROMIO of Syracuse]	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?	999
	am I myself?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	What woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one	999
	that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	What claim lays she to thee?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your	999
	horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I	999
	being a beast, she would have me; but that she,	999
	being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	What is she?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may	999
	not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have	999
	but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a	999
	wondrous fat marriage.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	How dost thou mean a fat marriage?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;	999
	and I know not what use to put her to but to make a	999
	lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I	999
	warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a	999
	Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,	999
	she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	What complexion is she of?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so	999
	clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over	999
	shoes in the grime of it.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	That's a fault that water will mend.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	What's her name?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's	999
	an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from	999
	hip to hip.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Then she bears some breadth?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:	999
	she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out	999
	countries in her.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	In what part of her body stands Ireland?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Where Scotland?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Where France?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war	999
	against her heir.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Where England?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no	999
	whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,	999
	by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Where Spain?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Where America, the Indies?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with	999
	rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich	999
	aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole	999
	armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this	999
	drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me	999
	Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what	999
	privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my	999
	shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my	999
	left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:	999
	And, I think, if my breast had not been made of	999
	faith and my heart of steel,	999
	She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made	999
	me turn i' the wheel.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Go hie thee presently, post to the road:	999
	An if the wind blow any way from shore,	999
	I will not harbour in this town to-night:	999
	If any bark put forth, come to the mart,	999
	Where I will walk till thou return to me.	999
	If every one knows us and we know none,	999
	'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	As from a bear a man would run for life,	999
	So fly I from her that would be my wife.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	There's none but witches do inhabit here;	999
	And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.	999
	She that doth call me husband, even my soul	999
	Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,	999
	Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,	999
	Of such enchanting presence and discourse,	999
	Hath almost made me traitor to myself:	999
	But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,	999
	I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.	999
	999
	[Enter ANGELO with the chain]	999
	999
ANGELO	Master Antipholus,--	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Ay, that's my name.	999
	999
ANGELO	I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.	999
	I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:	999
	The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	What is your will that I shall do with this?	999
	999
ANGELO	What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.	999
	999
ANGELO	Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.	999
	Go home with it and please your wife withal;	999
	And soon at supper-time I'll visit you	999
	And then receive my money for the chain.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	I pray you, sir, receive the money now,	999
	For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.	999
	999
ANGELO	You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	What I should think of this, I cannot tell:	999
	But this I think, there's no man is so vain	999
	That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.	999
	I see a man here needs not live by shifts,	999
	When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.	999
	I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay	999
	If any ship put out, then straight away.	999

SCENE I	A public place.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Second Merchant, ANGELO, and an Officer]	999
	999
Second Merchant	You know since Pentecost the sum is due,	999
	And since I have not much importuned you;	999
	Nor now I had not, but that I am bound	999
	To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:	999
	Therefore make present satisfaction,	999
	Or I'll attach you by this officer.	999
	999
ANGELO	Even just the sum that I do owe to you	999
	Is growing to me by Antipholus,	999
	And in the instant that I met with you	999
	He had of me a chain: at five o'clock	999
	I shall receive the money for the same.	999
	Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,	999
	I will discharge my bond and thank you too.	999
	999
	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus	999
	from the courtezan's]	999
	999
Officer	That labour may you save: see where he comes.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou	999
	And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow	999
	Among my wife and her confederates,	999
	For locking me out of my doors by day.	999
	But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;	999
	Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	A man is well holp up that trusts to you:	999
	I promised your presence and the chain;	999
	But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.	999
	Belike you thought our love would last too long,	999
	If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.	999
	999
ANGELO	Saving your merry humour, here's the note	999
	How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,	999
	The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.	999
	Which doth amount to three odd ducats more	999
	Than I stand debted to this gentleman:	999
	I pray you, see him presently discharged,	999
	For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	I am not furnish'd with the present money;	999
	Besides, I have some business in the town.	999
	Good signior, take the stranger to my house	999
	And with you take the chain and bid my wife	999
	Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:	999
	Perchance I will be there as soon as you.	999
	999
ANGELO	Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.	999
	999
ANGELO	Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;	999
	Or else you may return without your money.	999
	999
ANGELO	Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:	999
	Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,	999
	And I, to blame, have held him here too long.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse	999
	Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.	999
	I should have chid you for not bringing it,	999
	But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.	999
	999
Second Merchant	The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.	999
	999
ANGELO	You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.	999
	999
ANGELO	Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.	999
	Either send the chain or send me by some token.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,	999
	where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.	999
	999
Second Merchant	My business cannot brook this dalliance.	999
	Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:	999
	If not, I'll leave him to the officer.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	I answer you! what should I answer you?	999
	999
ANGELO	The money that you owe me for the chain.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	I owe you none till I receive the chain.	999
	999
ANGELO	You know I gave it you half an hour since.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.	999
	999
ANGELO	You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:	999
	Consider how it stands upon my credit.	999
	999
Second Merchant	Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.	999
	999
Officer	I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.	999
	999
ANGELO	This touches me in reputation.	999
	Either consent to pay this sum for me	999
	Or I attach you by this officer.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Consent to pay thee that I never had!	999
	Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.	999
	999
ANGELO	Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,	999
	I would not spare my brother in this case,	999
	If he should scorn me so apparently.	999
	999
Officer	I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	I do obey thee till I give thee bail.	999
	But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear	999
	As all the metal in your shop will answer.	999
	999
ANGELO	Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,	999
	To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.	999
	999
	[Enter DROMIO of Syracuse, from the bay]	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum	999
	That stays but till her owner comes aboard,	999
	And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,	999
	I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought	999
	The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.	999
	The ship is in her trim; the merry wind	999
	Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all	999
	But for their owner, master, and yourself.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,	999
	What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;	999
	And told thee to what purpose and what end.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	You sent me for a rope's end as soon:	999
	You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	I will debate this matter at more leisure	999
	And teach your ears to list me with more heed.	999
	To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:	999
	Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk	999
	That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,	999
	There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:	999
	Tell her I am arrested in the street	999
	And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!	999
	On, officer, to prison till it come.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Second Merchant, Angelo, Officer, and	999
	Antipholus of Ephesus]	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	To Adriana! that is where we dined,	999
	Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:	999
	She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.	999
	Thither I must, although against my will,	999
	For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.	999

	999
ADRIANA	Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?	999
	Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye	999
	That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?	999
	Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?	999
	What observation madest thou in this case	999
	Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?	999
	999
LUCIANA	First he denied you had in him no right.	999
	999
ADRIANA	He meant he did me none; the more my spite.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Then swore he that he was a stranger here.	999
	999
ADRIANA	And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Then pleaded I for you.	999
	999
ADRIANA	And what said he?	999
	999
LUCIANA	That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.	999
	999
ADRIANA	With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?	999
	999
LUCIANA	With words that in an honest suit might move.	999
	First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Didst speak him fair?	999
	999
LUCIANA	Have patience, I beseech.	999
	999
ADRIANA	I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;	999
	My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.	999
	He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,	999
	Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;	999
	Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;	999
	Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Who would be jealous then of such a one?	999
	No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Ah, but I think him better than I say,	999
	And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.	999
	Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:	999
	My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.	999
	999
	[Enter DROMIO of Syracuse]	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.	999
	999
LUCIANA	How hast thou lost thy breath?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	By running fast.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.	999
	A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;	999
	One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;	999
	A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;	999
	A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;	999
	A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that	999
	countermands	999
	The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;	999
	A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;	999
	One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Why, man, what is the matter?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.	999
	999
ADRIANA	What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;	999
	But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.	999
	Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?	999
	999
ADRIANA	Go fetch it, sister.	999
	999
	[Exit Luciana]	999
	999
		This I wonder at,	999
	That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.	999
	Tell me, was he arrested on a band?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;	999
	A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?	999
	999
ADRIANA	What, the chain?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:	999
	It was two ere I left him, and now the clock	999
	strikes one.	999
	999
ADRIANA	The hours come back! that did I never hear.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for	999
	very fear.	999
	999
ADRIANA	As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's	999
	worth, to season.	999
	Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say	999
	That Time comes stealing on by night and day?	999
	If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,	999
	Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?	999
	999
	[Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse]	999
	999
ADRIANA	Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;	999
	And bring thy master home immediately.	999
	Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--	999
	Conceit, my comfort and my injury.	999

SCENE III	A public place.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse]	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	There's not a man I meet but doth salute me	999
	As if I were their well-acquainted friend;	999
	And every one doth call me by my name.	999
	Some tender money to me; some invite me;	999
	Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;	999
	Some offer me commodities to buy:	999
	Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop	999
	And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,	999
	And therewithal took measure of my body.	999
	Sure, these are but imaginary wiles	999
	And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.	999
	999
	[Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE]	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have	999
	you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam	999
	that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's	999
	skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came	999
	behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you	999
	forsake your liberty.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	I understand thee not.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a	999
	bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,	999
	that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob	999
	and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed	999
	men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up	999
	his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a	999
	morris-pike.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	What, thou meanest an officer?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings	999
	any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that	999
	thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God	999
	give you good rest!'	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the	999
	bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were	999
	you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy	999
	Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to	999
	deliver you.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	The fellow is distract, and so am I;	999
	And here we wander in illusions:	999
	Some blessed power deliver us from hence!	999
	999
	[Enter a Courtezan]	999
	999
Courtezan	Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.	999
	I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:	999
	Is that the chain you promised me to-day?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, is this Mistress Satan?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	It is the devil.	999
	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here	999
	she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof	999
	comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as	999
	much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is	999
	written, they appear to men like angels of light:	999
	light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;	999
	ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.	999
	999
Courtezan	Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.	999
	Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a	999
	long spoon.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Why, Dromio?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with	999
	the devil.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?	999
	Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:	999
	I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.	999
	999
Courtezan	Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,	999
	Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,	999
	And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,	999
	A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,	999
	A nut, a cherry-stone;	999
	But she, more covetous, would have a chain.	999
	Master, be wise: an if you give it her,	999
	The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.	999
	999
Courtezan	I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:	999
	I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse]	999
	999
Courtezan	Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,	999
	Else would he never so demean himself.	999
	A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,	999
	And for the same he promised me a chain:	999
	Both one and other he denies me now.	999
	The reason that I gather he is mad,	999
	Besides this present instance of his rage,	999
	Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,	999
	Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.	999
	Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,	999
	On purpose shut the doors against his way.	999
	My way is now to hie home to his house,	999
	And tell his wife that, being lunatic,	999
	He rush'd into my house and took perforce	999
	My ring away. This course I fittest choose;	999
	For forty ducats is too much to lose.	999

SCENE IV	A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and the Officer]	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Fear me not, man; I will not break away:	999
	I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,	999
	To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.	999
	My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,	999
	And will not lightly trust the messenger	999
	That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,	999
	I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.	999
	999
	[Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end]	999
	999
	Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.	999
	How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	But where's the money?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.	999
	999
	[Beating him]	999
	999
Officer	Good sir, be patient.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.	999
	999
Officer	Good, now, hold thy tongue.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Thou whoreson, senseless villain!	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel	999
	your blows.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an	999
	ass.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long	999
	ears. I have served him from the hour of my	999
	nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his	999
	hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he	999
	heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me	999
	with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;	999
	raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with	999
	it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when	999
	I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a	999
	beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath	999
	lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Come, go along; my wife is coming yonder.	999

	[Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and PINCH]	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Mistress, 'respice finem,' respect your end; or	999
	rather, the prophecy like the parrot, 'beware the	999
	rope's-end.'	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Wilt thou still talk?	999
	999
	[Beating him]	999
	999
Courtezan	How say you now? is not your husband mad?	999
	999
ADRIANA	His incivility confirms no less.	999
	Good Doctor Pinch, you are a conjurer;	999
	Establish him in his true sense again,	999
	And I will please you what you will demand.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Alas, how fiery and how sharp he looks!	999
	999
Courtezan	Mark how he trembles in his ecstasy!	999
	999
PINCH	Give me your hand and let me feel your pulse.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	There is my hand, and let it feel your ear.	999
	999
	[Striking him]	999
	999
PINCH	I charge thee, Satan, housed within this man,	999
	To yield possession to my holy prayers	999
	And to thy state of darkness hie thee straight:	999
	I conjure thee by all the saints in heaven!	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Peace, doting wizard, peace! I am not mad.	999
	999
ADRIANA	O, that thou wert not, poor distressed soul!	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	You minion, you, are these your customers?	999
	Did this companion with the saffron face	999
	Revel and feast it at my house to-day,	999
	Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut	999
	And I denied to enter in my house?	999
	999
ADRIANA	O husband, God doth know you dined at home;	999
	Where would you had remain'd until this time,	999
	Free from these slanders and this open shame!	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	And did not she herself revile me there?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	And did not I in rage depart from thence?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	In verity you did; my bones bear witness,	999
	That since have felt the vigour of his rage.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?	999
	999
PINCH	It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,	999
	And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,	999
	By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;	999
	But surely master, not a rag of money.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?	999
	999
ADRIANA	He came to me and I deliver'd it.	999
	999
LUCIANA	And I am witness with her that she did.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	God and the rope-maker bear me witness	999
	That I was sent for nothing but a rope!	999
	999
PINCH	Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;	999
	I know it by their pale and deadly looks:	999
	They must be bound and laid in some dark room.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?	999
	And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?	999
	999
ADRIANA	I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	And, gentle master, I received no gold;	999
	But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;	999
	And art confederate with a damned pack	999
	To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:	999
	But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes	999
	That would behold in me this shameful sport.	999
	999
	[Enter three or four, and offer to bind him.	999
	He strives]	999
	999
ADRIANA	O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.	999
	999
PINCH	More company! The fiend is strong within him.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,	999
	I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them	999
	To make a rescue?	999
	999
Officer	                  Masters, let him go	999
	He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.	999
	999
PINCH	Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.	999
	999
	[They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus]	999
	999
ADRIANA	What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?	999
	Hast thou delight to see a wretched man	999
	Do outrage and displeasure to himself?	999
	999
Officer	He is my prisoner: if I let him go,	999
	The debt he owes will be required of me.	999
	999
ADRIANA	I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:	999
	Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,	999
	And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.	999
	Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd	999
	Home to my house. O most unhappy day!	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	O most unhappy strumpet!	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Master, I am here entered in bond for you.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:	999
	cry 'The devil!'	999
	999
LUCIANA	God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!	999
	999
ADRIANA	Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and	999
	Courtezan]	999
	999
	Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?	999
	999
Officer	One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?	999
	999
ADRIANA	I know the man. What is the sum he owes?	999
	999
Officer	Two hundred ducats.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Say, how grows it due?	999
	999
Officer	Due for a chain your husband had of him.	999
	999
ADRIANA	He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.	999
	999
Courtezan	When as your husband all in rage to-day	999
	Came to my house and took away my ring--	999
	The ring I saw upon his finger now--	999
	Straight after did I meet him with a chain.	999
	999
ADRIANA	It may be so, but I did never see it.	999
	Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:	999
	I long to know the truth hereof at large.	999
	999

ADRIANA	And come with naked swords.	999
	Let's call more help to have them bound again.	999
	999
Officer	Away! they'll kill us.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio	999
	of Syracuse]	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	I see these witches are afraid of swords.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	She that would be your wife now ran from you.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:	999
	I long that we were safe and sound aboard.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us	999
	no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:	999
	methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for	999
	the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of	999
	me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and	999
	turn witch.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	I will not stay to-night for all the town;	999
	Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.	999
	999

	THE COMEDY OF ERRORS	999
	999
	999
ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A street before a Priory.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO]	999
	999
ANGELO	I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;	999
	But, I protest, he had the chain of me,	999
	Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.	999
	999
Second Merchant	How is the man esteemed here in the city?	999
	999
ANGELO	Of very reverend reputation, sir,	999
	Of credit infinite, highly beloved,	999
	Second to none that lives here in the city:	999
	His word might bear my wealth at any time.	999
	999
Second Merchant	Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.	999
	999
	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse]	999
	999
ANGELO	'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck	999
	Which he forswore most monstrously to have.	999
	Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.	999
	Signior Antipholus, I wonder much	999
	That you would put me to this shame and trouble;	999
	And, not without some scandal to yourself,	999
	With circumstance and oaths so to deny	999
	This chain which now you wear so openly:	999
	Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,	999
	You have done wrong to this my honest friend,	999
	Who, but for staying on our controversy,	999
	Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:	999
	This chain you had of me; can you deny it?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	I think I had; I never did deny it.	999
	999
Second Merchant	Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?	999
	999
Second Merchant	These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.	999
	Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest	999
	To walk where any honest man resort.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:	999
	I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty	999
	Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.	999
	999
Second Merchant	I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.	999
	999
	[They draw]	999
	999
	[Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and others]	999
	999
ADRIANA	Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.	999
	Some get within him, take his sword away:	999
	Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!	999
	This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!	999
	999
	[Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse	999
	to the Priory]	999
	999
	[Enter the Lady Abbess, AEMILIA]	999
	999
AEMELIA	Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?	999
	999
ADRIANA	To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.	999
	Let us come in, that we may bind him fast	999
	And bear him home for his recovery.	999
	999
ANGELO	I knew he was not in his perfect wits.	999
	999
Second Merchant	I am sorry now that I did draw on him.	999
	999
AEMELIA	How long hath this possession held the man?	999
	999
ADRIANA	This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,	999
	And much different from the man he was;	999
	But till this afternoon his passion	999
	Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.	999
	999
AEMELIA	Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?	999
	Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye	999
	Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?	999
	A sin prevailing much in youthful men,	999
	Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.	999
	Which of these sorrows is he subject to?	999
	999
ADRIANA	To none of these, except it be the last;	999
	Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.	999
	999
AEMELIA	You should for that have reprehended him.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Why, so I did.	999
	999
AEMELIA	                  Ay, but not rough enough.	999
	999
ADRIANA	As roughly as my modesty would let me.	999
	999
AEMELIA	Haply, in private.	999
	999
ADRIANA	And in assemblies too.	999
	999
AEMELIA	Ay, but not enough.	999
	999
ADRIANA	It was the copy of our conference:	999
	In bed he slept not for my urging it;	999
	At board he fed not for my urging it;	999
	Alone, it was the subject of my theme;	999
	In company I often glanced it;	999
	Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.	999
	999
AEMELIA	And thereof came it that the man was mad.	999
	The venom clamours of a jealous woman	999
	Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.	999
	It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,	999
	And therefore comes it that his head is light.	999
	Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:	999
	Unquiet meals make ill digestions;	999
	Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;	999
	And what's a fever but a fit of madness?	999
	Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:	999
	Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue	999
	But moody and dull melancholy,	999
	Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,	999
	And at her heels a huge infectious troop	999
	Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?	999
	In food, in sport and life-preserving rest	999
	To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:	999
	The consequence is then thy jealous fits	999
	Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.	999
	999
LUCIANA	She never reprehended him but mildly,	999
	When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.	999
	Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?	999
	999
ADRIANA	She did betray me to my own reproof.	999
	Good people enter and lay hold on him.	999
	999
AEMELIA	No, not a creature enters in my house.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Then let your servants bring my husband forth.	999
	999
AEMELIA	Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,	999
	And it shall privilege him from your hands	999
	Till I have brought him to his wits again,	999
	Or lose my labour in assaying it.	999
	999
ADRIANA	I will attend my husband, be his nurse,	999
	Diet his sickness, for it is my office,	999
	And will have no attorney but myself;	999
	And therefore let me have him home with me.	999
	999
AEMELIA	Be patient; for I will not let him stir	999
	Till I have used the approved means I have,	999
	With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,	999
	To make of him a formal man again:	999
	It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,	999
	A charitable duty of my order.	999
	Therefore depart and leave him here with me.	999
	999
ADRIANA	I will not hence and leave my husband here:	999
	And ill it doth beseem your holiness	999
	To separate the husband and the wife.	999
	999
AEMELIA	Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LUCIANA	Complain unto the duke of this indignity.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet	999
	And never rise until my tears and prayers	999
	Have won his grace to come in person hither	999
	And take perforce my husband from the abbess.	999
	999
Second Merchant	By this, I think, the dial points at five:	999
	Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person	999
	Comes this way to the melancholy vale,	999
	The place of death and sorry execution,	999
	Behind the ditches of the abbey here.	999
	999
ANGELO	Upon what cause?	999
	999
Second Merchant	To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,	999
	Who put unluckily into this bay	999
	Against the laws and statutes of this town,	999
	Beheaded publicly for his offence.	999
	999
ANGELO	See where they come: we will behold his death.	999
	999
LUCIANA	Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE SOLINUS, attended; AEGEON bareheaded; with the	999
	Headsman and other Officers]	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Yet once again proclaim it publicly,	999
	If any friend will pay the sum for him,	999
	He shall not die; so much we tender him.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:	999
	It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.	999
	999
ADRIANA	May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,	999
	Whom I made lord of me and all I had,	999
	At your important letters,--this ill day	999
	A most outrageous fit of madness took him;	999
	That desperately he hurried through the street,	999
	With him his bondman, all as mad as he--	999
	Doing displeasure to the citizens	999
	By rushing in their houses, bearing thence	999
	Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.	999
	Once did I get him bound and sent him home,	999
	Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,	999
	That here and there his fury had committed.	999
	Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,	999
	He broke from those that had the guard of him;	999
	And with his mad attendant and himself,	999
	Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,	999
	Met us again and madly bent on us,	999
	Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,	999
	We came again to bind them. Then they fled	999
	Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:	999
	And here the abbess shuts the gates on us	999
	And will not suffer us to fetch him out,	999
	Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.	999
	Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command	999
	Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Long since thy husband served me in my wars,	999
	And I to thee engaged a prince's word,	999
	When thou didst make him master of thy bed,	999
	To do him all the grace and good I could.	999
	Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate	999
	And bid the lady abbess come to me.	999
	I will determine this before I stir.	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
Servant	O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!	999
	My master and his man are both broke loose,	999
	Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor	999
	Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;	999
	And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him	999
	Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:	999
	My master preaches patience to him and the while	999
	His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,	999
	And sure, unless you send some present help,	999
	Between them they will kill the conjurer.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,	999
	And that is false thou dost report to us.	999
	999
Servant	Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;	999
	I have not breathed almost since I did see it.	999
	He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,	999
	To scorch your face and to disfigure you.	999
	999
	[Cry within]	999
	999
	Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!	999
	999
ADRIANA	Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,	999
	That he is borne about invisible:	999
	Even now we housed him in the abbey here;	999
	And now he's there, past thought of human reason.	999
	999
	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus]	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!	999
	Even for the service that long since I did thee,	999
	When I bestrid thee in the wars and took	999
	Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood	999
	That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.	999
	999
AEGEON	Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,	999
	I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!	999
	She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,	999
	That hath abused and dishonour'd me	999
	Even in the strength and height of injury!	999
	Beyond imagination is the wrong	999
	That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,	999
	While she with harlots feasted in my house.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?	999
	999
ADRIANA	No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister	999
	To-day did dine together. So befall my soul	999
	As this is false he burdens me withal!	999
	999
LUCIANA	Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,	999
	But she tells to your highness simple truth!	999
	999
ANGELO	O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:	999
	In this the madman justly chargeth them.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	My liege, I am advised what I say,	999
	Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,	999
	Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,	999
	Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.	999
	This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:	999
	That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,	999
	Could witness it, for he was with me then;	999
	Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,	999
	Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,	999
	Where Balthazar and I did dine together.	999
	Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,	999
	I went to seek him: in the street I met him	999
	And in his company that gentleman.	999
	There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down	999
	That I this day of him received the chain,	999
	Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which	999
	He did arrest me with an officer.	999
	I did obey, and sent my peasant home	999
	For certain ducats: he with none return'd	999
	Then fairly I bespoke the officer	999
	To go in person with me to my house.	999
	By the way we met	999
	My wife, her sister, and a rabble more	999
	Of vile confederates. Along with them	999
	They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,	999
	A mere anatomy, a mountebank,	999
	A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,	999
	A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,	999
	A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,	999
	Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,	999
	And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,	999
	And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,	999
	Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together	999
	They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence	999
	And in a dark and dankish vault at home	999
	There left me and my man, both bound together;	999
	Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,	999
	I gain'd my freedom, and immediately	999
	Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech	999
	To give me ample satisfaction	999
	For these deep shames and great indignities.	999
	999
ANGELO	My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,	999
	That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	But had he such a chain of thee or no?	999
	999
ANGELO	He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,	999
	These people saw the chain about his neck.	999
	999
Second Merchant	Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine	999
	Heard you confess you had the chain of him	999
	After you first forswore it on the mart:	999
	And thereupon I drew my sword on you;	999
	And then you fled into this abbey here,	999
	From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	I never came within these abbey-walls,	999
	Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:	999
	I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!	999
	And this is false you burden me withal.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Why, what an intricate impeach is this!	999
	I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.	999
	If here you housed him, here he would have been;	999
	If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:	999
	You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here	999
	Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.	999
	999
Courtezan	He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?	999
	999
Courtezan	As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.	999
	I think you are all mated or stark mad.	999
	999
	[Exit one to Abbess]	999
	999
AEGEON	Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:	999
	Haply I see a friend will save my life	999
	And pay the sum that may deliver me.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.	999
	999
AEGEON	Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?	999
	And is not that your bondman, Dromio?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Within this hour I was his bondman sir,	999
	But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:	999
	Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.	999
	999
AEGEON	I am sure you both of you remember me.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;	999
	For lately we were bound, as you are now	999
	You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?	999
	999
AEGEON	Why look you strange on me? you know me well.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	I never saw you in my life till now.	999
	999
AEGEON	O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,	999
	And careful hours with time's deformed hand	999
	Have written strange defeatures in my face:	999
	But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Neither.	999
	999
AEGEON	Dromio, nor thou?	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	                  No, trust me, sir, nor I.	999
	999
AEGEON	I am sure thou dost.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a	999
	man denies, you are now bound to believe him.	999
	999
AEGEON	Not know my voice! O time's extremity,	999
	Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue	999
	In seven short years, that here my only son	999
	Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?	999
	Though now this grained face of mine be hid	999
	In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,	999
	And all the conduits of my blood froze up,	999
	Yet hath my night of life some memory,	999
	My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,	999
	My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:	999
	All these old witnesses--I cannot err--	999
	Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	I never saw my father in my life.	999
	999
AEGEON	But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,	999
	Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,	999
	Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	The duke and all that know me in the city	999
	Can witness with me that it is not so	999
	I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years	999
	Have I been patron to Antipholus,	999
	During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:	999
	I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.	999
	999
	[Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and	999
	DROMIO of Syracuse]	999
	999
AEMELIA	Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.	999
	999
	[All gather to see them]	999
	999
ADRIANA	I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	One of these men is Genius to the other;	999
	And so of these. Which is the natural man,	999
	And which the spirit? who deciphers them?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	O, my old master! who hath bound him here?	999
	999
AEMELIA	Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds	999
	And gain a husband by his liberty.	999
	Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man	999
	That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia	999
	That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:	999
	O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,	999
	And speak unto the same AEmilia!	999
	999
AEGEON	If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:	999
	If thou art she, tell me where is that son	999
	That floated with thee on the fatal raft?	999
	999
AEMELIA	By men of Epidamnum he and I	999
	And the twin Dromio all were taken up;	999
	But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth	999
	By force took Dromio and my son from them	999
	And me they left with those of Epidamnum.	999
	What then became of them I cannot tell	999
	I to this fortune that you see me in.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Why, here begins his morning story right;	999
	These two Antipholuses, these two so like,	999
	And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--	999
	Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--	999
	These are the parents to these children,	999
	Which accidentally are met together.	999
	Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	And I with him.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,	999
	Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.	999
	999
ADRIANA	Which of you two did dine with me to-day?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	I, gentle mistress.	999
	999
ADRIANA	And are not you my husband?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	No; I say nay to that.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	And so do I; yet did she call me so:	999
	And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,	999
	Did call me brother.	999
	999
	[To Luciana]	999
	999
		What I told you then,	999
	I hope I shall have leisure to make good;	999
	If this be not a dream I see and hear.	999
	999
ANGELO	That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	I think it be, sir; I deny it not.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.	999
	999
ANGELO	I think I did, sir; I deny it not.	999
	999
ADRIANA	I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,	999
	By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	No, none by me.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	This purse of ducats I received from you,	999
	And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.	999
	I see we still did meet each other's man,	999
	And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,	999
	And thereupon these errors are arose.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	These ducats pawn I for my father here.	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	It shall not need; thy father hath his life.	999
	999
Courtezan	Sir, I must have that diamond from you.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.	999
	999
AEMELIA	Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains	999
	To go with us into the abbey here	999
	And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:	999
	And all that are assembled in this place,	999
	That by this sympathized one day's error	999
	Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,	999
	And we shall make full satisfaction.	999
	Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail	999
	Of you, my sons; and till this present hour	999
	My heavy burden ne'er delivered.	999
	The duke, my husband and my children both,	999
	And you the calendars of their nativity,	999
	Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;	999
	After so long grief, such festivity!	999
	999
DUKE SOLINUS	With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus	999
	of Ephesus, Dromio of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus]	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF EPHESUS	Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.	999
	999
ANTIPHOLUS	999
OF SYRACUSE	He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:	999
	Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:	999
	Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus]	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	There is a fat friend at your master's house,	999
	That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:	999
	She now shall be my sister, not my wife.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:	999
	I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.	999
	Will you walk in to see their gossiping?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Not I, sir; you are my elder.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	That's a question: how shall we try it?	999
	999
DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.	999
	999
DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Nay, then, thus:	999
	We came into the world like brother and brother;	999
	And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The king of Navarre's park.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE	999
	and DUMAIN]	999
	999
FERDINAND	Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,	999
	Live register'd upon our brazen tombs	999
	And then grace us in the disgrace of death;	999
	When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,	999
	The endeavor of this present breath may buy	999
	That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge	999
	And make us heirs of all eternity.	999
	Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,	999
	That war against your own affections	999
	And the huge army of the world's desires,--	999
	Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:	999
	Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;	999
	Our court shall be a little Academe,	999
	Still and contemplative in living art.	999
	You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,	999
	Have sworn for three years' term to live with me	999
	My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes	999
	That are recorded in this schedule here:	999
	Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,	999
	That his own hand may strike his honour down	999
	That violates the smallest branch herein:	999
	If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,	999
	Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:	999
	The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:	999
	Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits	999
	Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.	999
	999
DUMAIN	My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:	999
	The grosser manner of these world's delights	999
	He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:	999
	To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;	999
	With all these living in philosophy.	999
	999
BIRON	I can but say their protestation over;	999
	So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,	999
	That is, to live and study here three years.	999
	But there are other strict observances;	999
	As, not to see a woman in that term,	999
	Which I hope well is not enrolled there;	999
	And one day in a week to touch no food	999
	And but one meal on every day beside,	999
	The which I hope is not enrolled there;	999
	And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,	999
	And not be seen to wink of all the day--	999
	When I was wont to think no harm all night	999
	And make a dark night too of half the day--	999
	Which I hope well is not enrolled there:	999
	O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,	999
	Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!	999
	999
FERDINAND	Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.	999
	999
BIRON	Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:	999
	I only swore to study with your grace	999
	And stay here in your court for three years' space.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.	999
	999
BIRON	By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.	999
	What is the end of study? let me know.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Why, that to know, which else we should not know.	999
	999
BIRON	Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?	999
	999
FERDINAND	Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.	999
	999
BIRON	Come on, then; I will swear to study so,	999
	To know the thing I am forbid to know:	999
	As thus,--to study where I well may dine,	999
	When I to feast expressly am forbid;	999
	Or study where to meet some mistress fine,	999
	When mistresses from common sense are hid;	999
	Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,	999
	Study to break it and not break my troth.	999
	If study's gain be thus and this be so,	999
	Study knows that which yet it doth not know:	999
	Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.	999
	999
FERDINAND	These be the stops that hinder study quite	999
	And train our intellects to vain delight.	999
	999
BIRON	Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,	999
	Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:	999
	As, painfully to pore upon a book	999
	To seek the light of truth; while truth the while	999
	Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:	999
	Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:	999
	So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,	999
	Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.	999
	Study me how to please the eye indeed	999
	By fixing it upon a fairer eye,	999
	Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed	999
	And give him light that it was blinded by.	999
	Study is like the heaven's glorious sun	999
	That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:	999
	Small have continual plodders ever won	999
	Save base authority from others' books	999
	These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights	999
	That give a name to every fixed star	999
	Have no more profit of their shining nights	999
	Than those that walk and wot not what they are.	999
	Too much to know is to know nought but fame;	999
	And every godfather can give a name.	999
	999
FERDINAND	How well he's read, to reason against reading!	999
	999
DUMAIN	Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.	999
	999
BIRON	The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.	999
	999
DUMAIN	How follows that?	999
	999
BIRON	                  Fit in his place and time.	999
	999
DUMAIN	In reason nothing.	999
	999
BIRON	                  Something then in rhyme.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,	999
	That bites the first-born infants of the spring.	999
	999
BIRON	Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast	999
	Before the birds have any cause to sing?	999
	Why should I joy in any abortive birth?	999
	At Christmas I no more desire a rose	999
	Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;	999
	But like of each thing that in season grows.	999
	So you, to study now it is too late,	999
	Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.	999
	999
BIRON	No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:	999
	And though I have for barbarism spoke more	999
	Than for that angel knowledge you can say,	999
	Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore	999
	And bide the penance of each three years' day.	999
	Give me the paper; let me read the same;	999
	And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.	999
	999
FERDINAND	How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!	999
	999
BIRON	[Reads]  'Item, That no woman shall come within a	999
	mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	Four days ago.	999
	999
BIRON	Let's see the penalty.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	Marry, that did I.	999
	999
BIRON	Sweet lord, and why?	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	To fright them hence with that dread penalty.	999
	999
BIRON	A dangerous law against gentility!	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman	999
	within the term of three years, he shall endure such	999
	public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'	999
	This article, my liege, yourself must break;	999
	For well you know here comes in embassy	999
	The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--	999
	A maid of grace and complete majesty--	999
	About surrender up of Aquitaine	999
	To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:	999
	Therefore this article is made in vain,	999
	Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.	999
	999
FERDINAND	What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.	999
	999
BIRON	So study evermore is overshot:	999
	While it doth study to have what it would	999
	It doth forget to do the thing it should,	999
	And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,	999
	'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.	999
	999
FERDINAND	We must of force dispense with this decree;	999
	She must lie here on mere necessity.	999
	999
BIRON	Necessity will make us all forsworn	999
	Three thousand times within this three years' space;	999
	For every man with his affects is born,	999
	Not by might master'd but by special grace:	999
	If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;	999
	I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'	999
	So to the laws at large I write my name:	999
	999
	[Subscribes]	999
	999
	And he that breaks them in the least degree	999
	Stands in attainder of eternal shame:	999
	Suggestions are to other as to me;	999
	But I believe, although I seem so loath,	999
	I am the last that will last keep his oath.	999
	But is there no quick recreation granted?	999
	999
FERDINAND	Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted	999
	With a refined traveller of Spain;	999
	A man in all the world's new fashion planted,	999
	That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;	999
	One whom the music of his own vain tongue	999
	Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;	999
	A man of complements, whom right and wrong	999
	Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:	999
	This child of fancy, that Armado hight,	999
	For interim to our studies shall relate	999
	In high-born words the worth of many a knight	999
	From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.	999
	How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;	999
	But, I protest, I love to hear him lie	999
	And I will use him for my minstrelsy.	999
	999
BIRON	Armado is a most illustrious wight,	999
	A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;	999
	And so to study, three years is but short.	999
	999
	[Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD]	999
	999
DULL	Which is the duke's own person?	999
	999
BIRON	This, fellow: what wouldst?	999
	999
DULL	I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his	999
	grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person	999
	in flesh and blood.	999
	999
BIRON	This is he.	999
	999
DULL	Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany	999
	abroad: this letter will tell you more.	999
	999
COSTARD	Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.	999
	999
FERDINAND	A letter from the magnificent Armado.	999
	999
BIRON	How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!	999
	999
BIRON	To hear? or forbear laughing?	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to	999
	forbear both.	999
	999
BIRON	Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to	999
	climb in the merriness.	999
	999
COSTARD	The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.	999
	The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.	999
	999
BIRON	In what manner?	999
	999
COSTARD	In manner and form following, sir; all those three:	999
	I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with	999
	her upon the form, and taken following her into the	999
	park; which, put together, is in manner and form	999
	following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the	999
	manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--	999
	in some form.	999
	999
BIRON	For the following, sir?	999
	999
COSTARD	As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend	999
	the right!	999
	999
FERDINAND	Will you hear this letter with attention?	999
	999
BIRON	As we would hear an oracle.	999
	999
COSTARD	Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.	999
	999
FERDINAND	[Reads]  'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and	999
	sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,	999
	and body's fostering patron.'	999
	999
COSTARD	Not a word of Costard yet.	999
	999
FERDINAND	[Reads]  'So it is,'--	999
	999
COSTARD	It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in	999
	telling true, but so.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Peace!	999
	999
COSTARD	Be to me and every man that dares not fight!	999
	999
FERDINAND	No words!	999
	999
COSTARD	Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.	999
	999
FERDINAND	[Reads]  'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured	999
	melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour	999
	to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving	999
	air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to	999
	walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when	999
	beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down	999
	to that nourishment which is called supper: so much	999
	for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,	999
	I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then	999
	for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter	999
	that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth	999
	from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which	999
	here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;	999
	but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east	999
	and by east from the west corner of thy curious-	999
	knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited	999
	swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--	999
	999
COSTARD	Me?	999
	999
FERDINAND	[Reads]  'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--	999
	999
COSTARD	Me?	999
	999
FERDINAND	[Reads]  'that shallow vassal,'--	999
	999
COSTARD	Still me?	999
	999
FERDINAND	[Reads]  'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--	999
	999
COSTARD	O, me!	999
	999
FERDINAND	[Reads]  'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy	999
	established proclaimed edict and continent canon,	999
	which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say	999
	wherewith,--	999
	999
COSTARD	With a wench.	999
	999
FERDINAND	[Reads]  'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a	999
	female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a	999
	woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,	999
	have sent to thee, to receive the meed of	999
	punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony	999
	Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and	999
	estimation.'	999
	999
DULL	'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.	999
	999
FERDINAND	[Reads]  'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel	999
	called which I apprehended with the aforesaid	999
	swain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;	999
	and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring	999
	her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted	999
	and heart-burning heat of duty.	999
		        DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'	999
	999
BIRON	This is not so well as I looked for, but the best	999
	that ever I heard.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say	999
	you to this?	999
	999
COSTARD	Sir, I confess the wench.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Did you hear the proclamation?	999
	999
COSTARD	I do confess much of the hearing it but little of	999
	the marking of it.	999
	999
FERDINAND	It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken	999
	with a wench.	999
	999
COSTARD	I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'	999
	999
COSTARD	This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.	999
	999
FERDINAND	It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'	999
	999
COSTARD	If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.	999
	999
FERDINAND	This maid will not serve your turn, sir.	999
	999
COSTARD	This maid will serve my turn, sir.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast	999
	a week with bran and water.	999
	999
COSTARD	I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.	999
	999
FERDINAND	And Don Armado shall be your keeper.	999
	My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:	999
	And go we, lords, to put in practise that	999
	Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.	999
	999
	[Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN]	999
	999
BIRON	I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,	999
	These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.	999
	Sirrah, come on.	999
	999
COSTARD	I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was	999
	taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true	999
	girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of	999
	prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and	999
	till then, sit thee down, sorrow!	999

ACT I	999

	999
	999
SCENE II	The same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH]	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit	999
	grows melancholy?	999
	999
MOTH	A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.	999
	999
MOTH	No, no; O Lord, sir, no.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my	999
	tender juvenal?	999
	999
MOTH	By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Why tough senior? why tough senior?	999
	999
MOTH	Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton	999
	appertaining to thy young days, which we may	999
	nominate tender.	999
	999
MOTH	And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your	999
	old time, which we may name tough.	999
	999
DON ADRIANO DE	999
ARMADO	Pretty and apt.	999
	999
MOTH	How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or	999
	I apt, and my saying pretty?	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Thou pretty, because little.	999
	999
MOTH	Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	And therefore apt, because quick.	999
	999
MOTH	Speak you this in my praise, master?	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	In thy condign praise.	999
	999
MOTH	I will praise an eel with the same praise.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	What, that an eel is ingenious?	999
	999
MOTH	That an eel is quick.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.	999
	999
MOTH	I am answered, sir.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I love not to be crossed.	999
	999
MOTH	[Aside]  He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I have promised to study three years with the duke.	999
	999
MOTH	You may do it in an hour, sir.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Impossible.	999
	999
MOTH	How many is one thrice told?	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.	999
	999
MOTH	You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I confess both: they are both the varnish of a	999
	complete man.	999
	999
MOTH	Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of	999
	deuce-ace amounts to.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	It doth amount to one more than two.	999
	999
MOTH	Which the base vulgar do call three.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	True.	999
	999
MOTH	Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here	999
	is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how	999
	easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and	999
	study three years in two words, the dancing horse	999
	will tell you.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	A most fine figure!	999
	999
MOTH	To prove you a cipher.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is	999
	base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a	999
	base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour	999
	of affection would deliver me from the reprobate	999
	thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and	999
	ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised	999
	courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should	999
	outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men	999
	have been in love?	999
	999
MOTH	Hercules, master.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name	999
	more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good	999
	repute and carriage.	999
	999
MOTH	Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great	999
	carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back	999
	like a porter: and he was in love.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do	999
	excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in	999
	carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's	999
	love, my dear Moth?	999
	999
MOTH	A woman, master.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Of what complexion?	999
	999
MOTH	Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Tell me precisely of what complexion.	999
	999
MOTH	Of the sea-water green, sir.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Is that one of the four complexions?	999
	999
MOTH	As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a	999
	love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason	999
	for it. He surely affected her for her wit.	999
	999
MOTH	It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	My love is most immaculate white and red.	999
	999
MOTH	Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under	999
	such colours.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Define, define, well-educated infant.	999
	999
MOTH	My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and	999
	pathetical!	999
	999
MOTH	     If she be made of white and red,	999
	Her faults will ne'er be known,	999
	For blushing cheeks by faults are bred	999
	And fears by pale white shown:	999
	Then if she fear, or be to blame,	999
	By this you shall not know,	999
	For still her cheeks possess the same	999
	Which native she doth owe.	999
	A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of	999
	white and red.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?	999
	999
MOTH	The world was very guilty of such a ballad some	999
	three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be	999
	found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for	999
	the writing nor the tune.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may	999
	example my digression by some mighty precedent.	999
	Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the	999
	park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.	999
	999
MOTH	[Aside]  To be whipped; and yet a better love than	999
	my master.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.	999
	999
MOTH	And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I say, sing.	999
	999
MOTH	Forbear till this company be past.	999
	999
	[Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA]	999
	999
DULL	Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard	999
	safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight	999
	nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.	999
	For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she	999
	is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!	999
	999
JAQUENETTA	Man?	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will visit thee at the lodge.	999
	999
JAQUENETTA	That's hereby.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I know where it is situate.	999
	999
JAQUENETTA	Lord, how wise you are!	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will tell thee wonders.	999
	999
JAQUENETTA	With that face?	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I love thee.	999
	999
JAQUENETTA	So I heard you say.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	And so, farewell.	999
	999
JAQUENETTA	Fair weather after you!	999
	999
DULL	Come, Jaquenetta, away!	999
	999
	[Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTA]	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou	999
	be pardoned.	999
	999
COSTARD	Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a	999
	full stomach.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Thou shalt be heavily punished.	999
	999
COSTARD	I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they	999
	are but lightly rewarded.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Take away this villain; shut him up.	999
	999
MOTH	Come, you transgressing slave; away!	999
	999
COSTARD	Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.	999
	999
MOTH	No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.	999
	999
COSTARD	Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation	999
	that I have seen, some shall see.	999
	999
MOTH	What shall some see?	999
	999
COSTARD	Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.	999
	It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their	999
	words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank	999
	God I have as little patience as another man; and	999
	therefore I can be quiet.	999
	999
	[Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD]	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I do affect the very ground, which is base, where	999
	her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which	999
	is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which	999
	is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And	999
	how can that be true love which is falsely	999
	attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:	999
	there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so	999
	tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was	999
	Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.	999
	Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;	999
	and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.	999
	The first and second cause will not serve my turn;	999
	the passado he respects not, the duello he regards	999
	not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his	999
	glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!	999
	be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,	999
	he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,	999
	for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;	999
	write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.	999

	999
	999
SCENE I	The same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA,	999
	KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other Attendants]	999
	999
BOYET	Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:	999
	Consider who the king your father sends,	999
	To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:	999
	Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,	999
	To parley with the sole inheritor	999
	Of all perfections that a man may owe,	999
	Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight	999
	Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.	999
	Be now as prodigal of all dear grace	999
	As Nature was in making graces dear	999
	When she did starve the general world beside	999
	And prodigally gave them all to you.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,	999
	Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:	999
	Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,	999
	Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:	999
	I am less proud to hear you tell my worth	999
	Than you much willing to be counted wise	999
	In spending your wit in the praise of mine.	999
	But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,	999
	You are not ignorant, all-telling fame	999
	Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,	999
	Till painful study shall outwear three years,	999
	No woman may approach his silent court:	999
	Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,	999
	Before we enter his forbidden gates,	999
	To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,	999
	Bold of your worthiness, we single you	999
	As our best-moving fair solicitor.	999
	Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,	999
	On serious business, craving quick dispatch,	999
	Importunes personal conference with his grace:	999
	Haste, signify so much; while we attend,	999
	Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.	999
	999
BOYET	Proud of employment, willingly I go.	999
	999
PRINCESS	All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.	999
	999
	[Exit BOYET]	999
	999
	Who are the votaries, my loving lords,	999
	That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?	999
	999
First Lord	Lord Longaville is one.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Know you the man?	999
	999
MARIA	I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,	999
	Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir	999
	Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized	999
	In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:	999
	A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;	999
	Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:	999
	Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.	999
	The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,	999
	If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,	999
	Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;	999
	Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills	999
	It should none spare that come within his power.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?	999
	999
MARIA	They say so most that most his humours know.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.	999
	Who are the rest?	999
	999
KATHARINE	The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,	999
	Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:	999
	Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;	999
	For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,	999
	And shape to win grace though he had no wit.	999
	I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;	999
	And much too little of that good I saw	999
	Is my report to his great worthiness.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Another of these students at that time	999
	Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.	999
	Biron they call him; but a merrier man,	999
	Within the limit of becoming mirth,	999
	I never spent an hour's talk withal:	999
	His eye begets occasion for his wit;	999
	For every object that the one doth catch	999
	The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,	999
	Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,	999
	Delivers in such apt and gracious words	999
	That aged ears play truant at his tales	999
	And younger hearings are quite ravished;	999
	So sweet and voluble is his discourse.	999
	999
PRINCESS	God bless my ladies! are they all in love,	999
	That every one her own hath garnished	999
	With such bedecking ornaments of praise?	999
	999
First Lord	Here comes Boyet.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BOYET]	999
	999
PRINCESS	Now, what admittance, lord?	999
	999
BOYET	Navarre had notice of your fair approach;	999
	And he and his competitors in oath	999
	Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,	999
	Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:	999
	He rather means to lodge you in the field,	999
	Like one that comes here to besiege his court,	999
	Than seek a dispensation for his oath,	999
	To let you enter his unpeopled house.	999
	Here comes Navarre.	999
	999
	[Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and	999
	Attendants]	999
	999
FERDINAND	Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.	999
	999
PRINCESS	'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have	999
	not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be	999
	yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.	999
	999
FERDINAND	You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.	999
	999
PRINCESS	I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,	999
	Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.	999
	I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:	999
	Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,	999
	And sin to break it.	999
	But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:	999
	To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.	999
	Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,	999
	And suddenly resolve me in my suit.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.	999
	999
PRINCESS	You will the sooner, that I were away;	999
	For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.	999
	999
BIRON	Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?	999
	999
ROSALINE	Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?	999
	999
BIRON	I know you did.	999
	999
ROSALINE	How needless was it then to ask the question!	999
	999
BIRON	You must not be so quick.	999
	999
ROSALINE	'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.	999
	999
BIRON	Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Not till it leave the rider in the mire.	999
	999
BIRON	What time o' day?	999
	999
ROSALINE	The hour that fools should ask.	999
	999
BIRON	Now fair befall your mask!	999
	999
ROSALINE	Fair fall the face it covers!	999
	999
BIRON	And send you many lovers!	999
	999
ROSALINE	Amen, so you be none.	999
	999
BIRON	Nay, then will I be gone.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Madam, your father here doth intimate	999
	The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;	999
	Being but the one half of an entire sum	999
	Disbursed by my father in his wars.	999
	But say that he or we, as neither have,	999
	Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid	999
	A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,	999
	One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,	999
	Although not valued to the money's worth.	999
	If then the king your father will restore	999
	But that one half which is unsatisfied,	999
	We will give up our right in Aquitaine,	999
	And hold fair friendship with his majesty.	999
	But that, it seems, he little purposeth,	999
	For here he doth demand to have repaid	999
	A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,	999
	On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,	999
	To have his title live in Aquitaine;	999
	Which we much rather had depart withal	999
	And have the money by our father lent	999
	Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.	999
	Dear Princess, were not his requests so far	999
	From reason's yielding, your fair self should make	999
	A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast	999
	And go well satisfied to France again.	999
	999
PRINCESS	You do the king my father too much wrong	999
	And wrong the reputation of your name,	999
	In so unseeming to confess receipt	999
	Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.	999
	999
FERDINAND	I do protest I never heard of it;	999
	And if you prove it, I'll repay it back	999
	Or yield up Aquitaine.	999
	999
PRINCESS	We arrest your word.	999
	Boyet, you can produce acquittances	999
	For such a sum from special officers	999
	Of Charles his father.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Satisfy me so.	999
	999
BOYET	So please your grace, the packet is not come	999
	Where that and other specialties are bound:	999
	To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.	999
	999
FERDINAND	It shall suffice me: at which interview	999
	All liberal reason I will yield unto.	999
	Meantime receive such welcome at my hand	999
	As honour without breach of honour may	999
	Make tender of to thy true worthiness:	999
	You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;	999
	But here without you shall be so received	999
	As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,	999
	Though so denied fair harbour in my house.	999
	Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:	999
	To-morrow shall we visit you again.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!	999
	999
FERDINAND	Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BIRON	Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.	999
	999
BIRON	I would you heard it groan.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Is the fool sick?	999
	999
BIRON	Sick at the heart.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Alack, let it blood.	999
	999
BIRON	Would that do it good?	999
	999
ROSALINE	My physic says 'ay.'	999
	999
BIRON	Will you prick't with your eye?	999
	999
ROSALINE	No point, with my knife.	999
	999
BIRON	Now, God save thy life!	999
	999
ROSALINE	And yours from long living!	999
	999
BIRON	I cannot stay thanksgiving.	999
	999
	[Retiring]	999
	999
DUMAIN	Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?	999
	999
BOYET	The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.	999
	999
DUMAIN	A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?	999
	999
BOYET	A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.	999
	999
BOYET	She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	Pray you, sir, whose daughter?	999
	999
BOYET	Her mother's, I have heard.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	God's blessing on your beard!	999
	999
BOYET	Good sir, be not offended.	999
	She is an heir of Falconbridge.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	Nay, my choler is ended.	999
	She is a most sweet lady.	999
	999
BOYET	Not unlike, sir, that may be.	999
	999
	[Exit LONGAVILLE]	999
	999
BIRON	What's her name in the cap?	999
	999
BOYET	Rosaline, by good hap.	999
	999
BIRON	Is she wedded or no?	999
	999
BOYET	To her will, sir, or so.	999
	999
BIRON	You are welcome, sir: adieu.	999
	999
BOYET	Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.	999
	999
	[Exit BIRON]	999
	999
MARIA	That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:	999
	Not a word with him but a jest.	999
	999
BOYET	And every jest but a word.	999
	999
PRINCESS	It was well done of you to take him at his word.	999
	999
BOYET	I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.	999
	999
MARIA	Two hot sheeps, marry.	999
	999
BOYET	And wherefore not ships?	999
	No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.	999
	999
MARIA	You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?	999
	999
BOYET	So you grant pasture for me.	999
	999
	[Offering to kiss her]	999
	999
MARIA	Not so, gentle beast:	999
	My lips are no common, though several they be.	999
	999
BOYET	Belonging to whom?	999
	999
MARIA	                  To my fortunes and me.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:	999
	This civil war of wits were much better used	999
	On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.	999
	999
BOYET	If my observation, which very seldom lies,	999
	By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,	999
	Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.	999
	999
PRINCESS	With what?	999
	999
BOYET	With that which we lovers entitle affected.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Your reason?	999
	999
BOYET	Why, all his behaviors did make their retire	999
	To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:	999
	His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,	999
	Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:	999
	His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,	999
	Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;	999
	All senses to that sense did make their repair,	999
	To feel only looking on fairest of fair:	999
	Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,	999
	As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;	999
	Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,	999
	Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:	999
	His face's own margent did quote such amazes	999
	That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.	999
	I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,	999
	An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.	999
	999
BOYET	But to speak that in words which his eye hath	999
	disclosed.	999
	I only have made a mouth of his eye,	999
	By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.	999
	999
MARIA	He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.	999
	999
BOYET	Do you hear, my mad wenches?	999
	999
MARIA	No.	999
	999
BOYET	What then, do you see?	999
	999
ROSALINE	Ay, our way to be gone.	999
	999
BOYET	You are too hard for me.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

	LOVE'S LABOURS LOST	999

	999
ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH]	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.	999
	999
MOTH	Concolinel.	999
	999
	[Singing]	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,	999
	give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately	999
	hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.	999
	999
MOTH	Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	How meanest thou? brawling in French?	999
	999
MOTH	No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at	999
	the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour	999
	it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and	999
	sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you	999
	swallowed love with singing love, sometime through	999
	the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling	999
	love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of	999
	your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly	999
	doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in	999
	your pocket like a man after the old painting; and	999
	keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.	999
	These are complements, these are humours; these	999
	betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without	999
	these; and make them men of note--do you note	999
	me?--that most are affected to these.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	How hast thou purchased this experience?	999
	999
MOTH	By my penny of observation.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	But O,--but O,--	999
	999
MOTH	'The hobby-horse is forgot.'	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?	999
	999
MOTH	No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your	999
	love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Almost I had.	999
	999
MOTH	Negligent student! learn her by heart.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	By heart and in heart, boy.	999
	999
MOTH	And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	What wilt thou prove?	999
	999
MOTH	A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon	999
	the instant: by heart you love her, because your	999
	heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,	999
	because your heart is in love with her; and out of	999
	heart you love her, being out of heart that you	999
	cannot enjoy her.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I am all these three.	999
	999
MOTH	And three times as much more, and yet nothing at	999
	all.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.	999
	999
MOTH	A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador	999
	for an ass.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Ha, ha! what sayest thou?	999
	999
MOTH	Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,	999
	for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The way is but short: away!	999
	999
MOTH	As swift as lead, sir.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The meaning, pretty ingenious?	999
	Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?	999
	999
MOTH	Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I say lead is slow.	999
	999
MOTH	You are too swift, sir, to say so:	999
	Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet smoke of rhetoric!	999
	He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:	999
	I shoot thee at the swain.	999
	999
MOTH	Thump then and I flee.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!	999
	By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:	999
	Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.	999
	My herald is return'd.	999
	999
	[Re-enter MOTH with COSTARD]	999
	999
MOTH	A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.	999
	999
COSTARD	No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the	999
	mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no	999
	l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly	999
	thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes	999
	me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!	999
	Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and	999
	the word l'envoy for a salve?	999
	999
MOTH	Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain	999
	Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.	999
	I will example it:	999
	The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,	999
	Were still at odds, being but three.	999
	There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.	999
	999
MOTH	I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	          The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,	999
	Were still at odds, being but three.	999
	999
MOTH	          Until the goose came out of door,	999
	And stay'd the odds by adding four.	999
	Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with	999
	my l'envoy.	999
	The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,	999
	Were still at odds, being but three.	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	          Until the goose came out of door,	999
	Staying the odds by adding four.	999
	999
MOTH	A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you	999
	desire more?	999
	999
COSTARD	The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.	999
	Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.	999
	To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:	999
	Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?	999
	999
MOTH	By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.	999
	Then call'd you for the l'envoy.	999
	999
COSTARD	True, and I for a plantain: thus came your	999
	argument in;	999
	Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;	999
	And he ended the market.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?	999
	999
MOTH	I will tell you sensibly.	999
	999
COSTARD	Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:	999
	I Costard, running out, that was safely within,	999
	Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	We will talk no more of this matter.	999
	999
COSTARD	Till there be more matter in the shin.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.	999
	999
COSTARD	O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,	999
	some goose, in this.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,	999
	enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,	999
	restrained, captivated, bound.	999
	999
COSTARD	True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,	999
	in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:	999
	bear this significant	999
	999
	[Giving a letter]	999
	999
		to the country maid Jaquenetta:	999
	there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine	999
	honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
MOTH	Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.	999
	999
COSTARD	My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!	999
	999
	[Exit MOTH]	999
	999
	Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!	999
	O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three	999
	farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this	999
	inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a	999
	remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!	999
	why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will	999
	never buy and sell out of this word.	999
	999
	[Enter BIRON]	999
	999
BIRON	O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.	999
	999
COSTARD	Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man	999
	buy for a remuneration?	999
	999
BIRON	What is a remuneration?	999
	999
COSTARD	Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.	999
	999
BIRON	Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.	999
	999
COSTARD	I thank your worship: God be wi' you!	999
	999
BIRON	Stay, slave; I must employ thee:	999
	As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,	999
	Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.	999
	999
COSTARD	When would you have it done, sir?	999
	999
BIRON	This afternoon.	999
	999
COSTARD	Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.	999
	999
BIRON	Thou knowest not what it is.	999
	999
COSTARD	I shall know, sir, when I have done it.	999
	999
BIRON	Why, villain, thou must know first.	999
	999
COSTARD	I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.	999
	999
BIRON	It must be done this afternoon.	999
	Hark, slave, it is but this:	999
	The princess comes to hunt here in the park,	999
	And in her train there is a gentle lady;	999
	When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,	999
	And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;	999
	And to her white hand see thou do commend	999
	This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.	999
	999
	[Giving him a shilling]	999
	999
COSTARD	Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,	999
	a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I	999
	will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BIRON	And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;	999
	A very beadle to a humorous sigh;	999
	A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;	999
	A domineering pedant o'er the boy;	999
	Than whom no mortal so magnificent!	999
	This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;	999
	This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;	999
	Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,	999
	The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,	999
	Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,	999
	Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,	999
	Sole imperator and great general	999
	Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--	999
	And I to be a corporal of his field,	999
	And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!	999
	What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!	999
	A woman, that is like a German clock,	999
	Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,	999
	And never going aright, being a watch,	999
	But being watch'd that it may still go right!	999
	Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;	999
	And, among three, to love the worst of all;	999
	A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,	999
	With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;	999
	Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed	999
	Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:	999
	And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!	999
	To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague	999
	That Cupid will impose for my neglect	999
	Of his almighty dreadful little might.	999
	Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:	999
	Some men must love my lady and some Joan.	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the PRINCESS, and her train, a Forester,	999
	BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE]	999
	999
PRINCESS	Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard	999
	Against the steep uprising of the hill?	999
	999
BOYET	I know not; but I think it was not he.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.	999
	Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:	999
	On Saturday we will return to France.	999
	Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush	999
	That we must stand and play the murderer in?	999
	999
Forester	Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;	999
	A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.	999
	999
PRINCESS	I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,	999
	And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.	999
	999
Forester	Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.	999
	999
PRINCESS	What, what? first praise me and again say no?	999
	O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!	999
	999
Forester	Yes, madam, fair.	999
	999
PRINCESS	                  Nay, never paint me now:	999
	Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.	999
	Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:	999
	Fair payment for foul words is more than due.	999
	999
Forester	Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.	999
	999
PRINCESS	See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!	999
	O heresy in fair, fit for these days!	999
	A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.	999
	But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,	999
	And shooting well is then accounted ill.	999
	Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:	999
	Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;	999
	If wounding, then it was to show my skill,	999
	That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.	999
	And out of question so it is sometimes,	999
	Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,	999
	When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,	999
	We bend to that the working of the heart;	999
	As I for praise alone now seek to spill	999
	The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.	999
	999
BOYET	Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty	999
	Only for praise sake, when they strive to be	999
	Lords o'er their lords?	999
	999
PRINCESS	Only for praise: and praise we may afford	999
	To any lady that subdues a lord.	999
	999
BOYET	Here comes a member of the commonwealth.	999
	999
	[Enter COSTARD]	999
	999
COSTARD	God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?	999
	999
PRINCESS	Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.	999
	999
COSTARD	Which is the greatest lady, the highest?	999
	999
PRINCESS	The thickest and the tallest.	999
	999
COSTARD	The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.	999
	An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,	999
	One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.	999
	Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.	999
	999
PRINCESS	What's your will, sir? what's your will?	999
	999
COSTARD	I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.	999
	999
PRINCESS	O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:	999
	Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;	999
	Break up this capon.	999
	999
BOYET	I am bound to serve.	999
	This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;	999
	It is writ to Jaquenetta.	999
	999
PRINCESS	We will read it, I swear.	999
	Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
BOYET	'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;	999
	true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that	999
	thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful	999
	than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have	999
	commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The	999
	magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set	999
	eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar	999
	Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,	999
	Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the	999
	vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He	999
	came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;	999
	overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he	999
	come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to	999
	whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the	999
	beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The	999
	conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.	999
	The captive is enriched: on whose side? the	999
	beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose	999
	side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in	999
	both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:	999
	thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.	999
	Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce	999
	thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I	999
	will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;	999
	for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,	999
	expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,	999
	my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every	999
	part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,	999
		    DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'	999
	999
	Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar	999
	'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.	999
	Submissive fall his princely feet before,	999
	And he from forage will incline to play:	999
	But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?	999
	Food for his rage, repasture for his den.	999
	999
PRINCESS	What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?	999
	What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?	999
	999
BOYET	I am much deceived but I remember the style.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.	999
	999
BOYET	This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;	999
	A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport	999
	To the prince and his bookmates.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Thou fellow, a word:	999
	Who gave thee this letter?	999
	999
COSTARD	I told you; my lord.	999
	999
PRINCESS	To whom shouldst thou give it?	999
	999
COSTARD	From my lord to my lady.	999
	999
PRINCESS	From which lord to which lady?	999
	999
COSTARD	From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,	999
	To a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.	999
	999
	[To ROSALINE]	999
	999
	Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PRINCESS and train]	999
	999
BOYET	Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?	999
	999
ROSALINE	Shall I teach you to know?	999
	999
BOYET	Ay, my continent of beauty.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Why, she that bears the bow.	999
	Finely put off!	999
	999
BOYET	My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,	999
	Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.	999
	Finely put on!	999
	999
ROSALINE	Well, then, I am the shooter.	999
	999
BOYET	And who is your deer?	999
	999
ROSALINE	If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.	999
	Finely put on, indeed!	999
	999
MARIA	You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes	999
	at the brow.	999
	999
BOYET	But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?	999
	999
ROSALINE	Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was	999
	a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as	999
	touching the hit it?	999
	999
BOYET	So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a	999
	woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little	999
	wench, as touching the hit it.	999
	999
ROSALINE	          Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,	999
	Thou canst not hit it, my good man.	999
	999
BOYET	          An I cannot, cannot, cannot,	999
	An I cannot, another can.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ROSALINE and KATHARINE]	999
	999
COSTARD	By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!	999
	999
MARIA	A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.	999
	999
BOYET	A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!	999
	Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.	999
	999
MARIA	Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.	999
	999
COSTARD	Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.	999
	999
BOYET	An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.	999
	999
COSTARD	Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.	999
	999
MARIA	Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.	999
	999
COSTARD	She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.	999
	999
BOYET	I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BOYET and MARIA]	999
	999
COSTARD	By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!	999
	Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!	999
	O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony	999
	vulgar wit!	999
	When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it	999
	were, so fit.	999
	Armado o' th' one side,--O, a most dainty man!	999
	To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!	999
	To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'	999
	will swear!	999
	And his page o' t' other side, that handful of wit!	999
	Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!	999

ACT IV	999

	999
SCENE II	The same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL]	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony	999
	of a good conscience.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe	999
	as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in	999
	the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;	999
	and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,	999
	the soil, the land, the earth.	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly	999
	varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I	999
	assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.	999
	999
DULL	'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of	999
	insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of	999
	explication; facere, as it were, replication, or	999
	rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his	999
	inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,	999
	uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,	999
	unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to	999
	insert again my haud credo for a deer.	999
	999
DULL	I said the deer was not a haud credo; twas a pricket.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!	999
	O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred	999
	in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he	999
	hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not	999
	replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in	999
	the duller parts:	999
	And such barren plants are set before us, that we	999
	thankful should be,	999
	Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that	999
	do fructify in us more than he.	999
	For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,	999
	So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:	999
	But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,	999
	Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.	999
	999
DULL	You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit	999
	What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five	999
	weeks old as yet?	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.	999
	999
DULL	What is Dictynna?	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,	999
	And raught not to five weeks when he came to	999
	five-score.	999
	The allusion holds in the exchange.	999
	999
DULL	'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds	999
	in the exchange.	999
	999
DULL	And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for	999
	the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside	999
	that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph	999
	on the death of the deer? And, to humour the	999
	ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall	999
	please you to abrogate scurrility.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.	999
	The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty	999
	pleasing pricket;	999
	Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made	999
	sore with shooting.	999
	The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps	999
	from thicket;	999
	Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.	999
	If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores	999
	one sorel.	999
	Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	A rare talent!	999
	999
DULL	[Aside]  If a talent be a claw, look how he claws	999
	him with a talent.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a	999
	foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,	999
	shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,	999
	revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of	999
	memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and	999
	delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the	999
	gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am	999
	thankful for it.	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my	999
	parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by	999
	you, and their daughters profit very greatly under	999
	you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall	999
	want no instruction; if their daughters be capable,	999
	I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca	999
	loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.	999
	999
	[Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD]	999
	999
JAQUENETTA	God give you good morrow, master Parson.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Master Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should be	999
	pierced, which is the one?	999
	999
COSTARD	Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a	999
	tuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough	999
	for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.	999
	999
JAQUENETTA	Good master Parson, be so good as read me this	999
	letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me	999
	from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra	999
	Ruminat,--and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I	999
	may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;	999
	Venetia, Venetia,	999
	Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.	999
	Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth thee	999
	not, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.	999
	Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,	999
	as Horace says in his--What, my soul, verses?	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	Ay, sir, and very learned.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	[Reads]	999
	999
	If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?	999
	Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!	999
	Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:	999
	Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like	999
	osiers bow'd.	999
	Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,	999
	Where all those pleasures live that art would	999
	comprehend:	999
	If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;	999
	Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,	999
	All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;	999
	Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:	999
	Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,	999
	Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.	999
	Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,	999
	That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	You find not the apostraphas, and so miss the	999
	accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are	999
	only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,	999
	facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.	999
	Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,	999
	but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of	999
	fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:	999
	so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,	999
	the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,	999
	was this directed to you?	999
	999
JAQUENETTA	Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange	999
	queen's lords.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	I will overglance the superscript: 'To the	999
	snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady	999
	Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of	999
	the letter, for the nomination of the party writing	999
	to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all	999
	desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this	999
	Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here	999
	he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger	999
	queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of	999
	progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my	999
	sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the	999
	king: it may concern much. Stay not thy	999
	compliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu.	999
	999
JAQUENETTA	Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!	999
	999
COSTARD	Have with thee, my girl.	999
	999
	[Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA]	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very	999
	religiously; and, as a certain father saith,--	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable	999
	colours. But to return to the verses: did they	999
	please you, Sir Nathaniel?	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	Marvellous well for the pen.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil	999
	of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please	999
	you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my	999
	privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid	999
	child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I	999
	will prove those verses to be very unlearned,	999
	neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: I	999
	beseech your society.	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is	999
	the happiness of life.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.	999
	999
	[To DULL]	999
	999
	Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not	999
	say me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are at	999
	their game, and we will to our recreation.	999

	999
SCENE III	The same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter BIRON, with a paper]	999
	999
BIRON	The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing	999
	myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in	999
	a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul	999
	word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say	999
	the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well	999
	proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as	999
	Ajax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:	999
	well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if	999
	I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her	999
	eye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would not	999
	love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing	999
	in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By	999
	heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme	999
	and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,	999
	and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my	999
	sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent	999
	it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter	999
	fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care	999
	a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one	999
	with a paper: God give him grace to groan!	999
	999
	[Stands aside]	999
	999
	[Enter FERDINAND, with a paper]	999
	999
FERDINAND	Ay me!	999
	999
BIRON	[Aside]  Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid:	999
	thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the	999
	left pap. In faith, secrets!	999
	999
FERDINAND	[Reads]	999
	999
	So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not	999
	To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,	999
	As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote	999
	The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:	999
	Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright	999
	Through the transparent bosom of the deep,	999
	As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;	999
	Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep:	999
	No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;	999
	So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.	999
	Do but behold the tears that swell in me,	999
	And they thy glory through my grief will show:	999
	But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep	999
	My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.	999
	O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,	999
	No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.	999
	How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper:	999
	Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?	999
	999
	[Steps aside]	999
	999
	What, Longaville! and reading! listen, ear.	999
	999
BIRON	Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!	999
	999
	[Enter LONGAVILLE, with a paper]	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	Ay me, I am forsworn!	999
	999
BIRON	Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.	999
	999
FERDINAND	In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!	999
	999
BIRON	One drunkard loves another of the name.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	Am I the first that have been perjured so?	999
	999
BIRON	I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:	999
	Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,	999
	The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:	999
	O sweet Maria, empress of my love!	999
	These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.	999
	999
BIRON	O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:	999
	Disfigure not his slop.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	This same shall go.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,	999
	'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,	999
	Persuade my heart to this false perjury?	999
	Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.	999
	A woman I forswore; but I will prove,	999
	Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:	999
	My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;	999
	Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.	999
	Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:	999
	Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,	999
	Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:	999
	If broken then, it is no fault of mine:	999
	If by me broke, what fool is not so wise	999
	To lose an oath to win a paradise?	999
	999
BIRON	This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,	999
	A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.	999
	God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.	999
	999
	[Steps aside]	999
	999
BIRON	All hid, all hid; an old infant play.	999
	Like a demigod here sit I in the sky.	999
	And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.	999
	More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!	999
	999
	[Enter DUMAIN, with a paper]	999
	999
	Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!	999
	999
DUMAIN	O most divine Kate!	999
	999
BIRON	O most profane coxcomb!	999
	999
DUMAIN	By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!	999
	999
BIRON	By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.	999
	999
BIRON	An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.	999
	999
DUMAIN	As upright as the cedar.	999
	999
BIRON	Stoop, I say;	999
	Her shoulder is with child.	999
	999
DUMAIN	As fair as day.	999
	999
BIRON	Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.	999
	999
DUMAIN	O that I had my wish!	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	And I had mine!	999
	999
FERDINAND	And I mine too, good Lord!	999
	999
BIRON	Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?	999
	999
DUMAIN	I would forget her; but a fever she	999
	Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.	999
	999
BIRON	A fever in your blood! why, then incision	999
	Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!	999
	999
DUMAIN	Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.	999
	999
BIRON	Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.	999
	999
DUMAIN	[Reads]	999
	999
	On a day--alack the day!--	999
	Love, whose month is ever May,	999
	Spied a blossom passing fair	999
	Playing in the wanton air:	999
	Through the velvet leaves the wind,	999
	All unseen, can passage find;	999
	That the lover, sick to death,	999
	Wish himself the heaven's breath.	999
	Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;	999
	Air, would I might triumph so!	999
	But, alack, my hand is sworn	999
	Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;	999
	Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,	999
	Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!	999
	Do not call it sin in me,	999
	That I am forsworn for thee;	999
	Thou for whom Jove would swear	999
	Juno but an Ethiope were;	999
	And deny himself for Jove,	999
	Turning mortal for thy love.	999
	This will I send, and something else more plain,	999
	That shall express my true love's fasting pain.	999
	O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,	999
	Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,	999
	Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;	999
	For none offend where all alike do dote.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	[Advancing]  Dumain, thy love is far from charity.	999
	You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,	999
	To be o'erheard and taken napping so.	999
	999
FERDINAND	[Advancing]  Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;	999
	You chide at him, offending twice as much;	999
	You do not love Maria; Longaville	999
	Did never sonnet for her sake compile,	999
	Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart	999
	His loving bosom to keep down his heart.	999
	I have been closely shrouded in this bush	999
	And mark'd you both and for you both did blush:	999
	I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,	999
	Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:	999
	Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;	999
	One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:	999
	999
	[To LONGAVILLE]	999
	999
	You would for paradise break faith, and troth;	999
	999
	[To DUMAIN]	999
	999
	And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.	999
	What will Biron say when that he shall hear	999
	Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?	999
	How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!	999
	How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!	999
	For all the wealth that ever I did see,	999
	I would not have him know so much by me.	999
	999
BIRON	Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.	999
	999
	[Advancing]	999
	999
	Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!	999
	Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove	999
	These worms for loving, that art most in love?	999
	Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears	999
	There is no certain princess that appears;	999
	You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;	999
	Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!	999
	But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,	999
	All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?	999
	You found his mote; the king your mote did see;	999
	But I a beam do find in each of three.	999
	O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,	999
	Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!	999
	O me, with what strict patience have I sat,	999
	To see a king transformed to a gnat!	999
	To see great Hercules whipping a gig,	999
	And profound Solomon to tune a jig,	999
	And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,	999
	And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!	999
	Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?	999
	And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?	999
	And where my liege's? all about the breast:	999
	A caudle, ho!	999
	999
FERDINAND	                  Too bitter is thy jest.	999
	Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?	999
	999
BIRON	Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:	999
	I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin	999
	To break the vow I am engaged in;	999
	I am betray'd, by keeping company	999
	With men like men of inconstancy.	999
	When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?	999
	Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time	999
	In pruning me? When shall you hear that I	999
	Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,	999
	A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,	999
	A leg, a limb?	999
	999
FERDINAND	                  Soft! whither away so fast?	999
	A true man or a thief that gallops so?	999
	999
BIRON	I post from love: good lover, let me go.	999
	999
	[Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD]	999
	999
JAQUENETTA	God bless the king!	999
	999
FERDINAND	What present hast thou there?	999
	999
COSTARD	Some certain treason.	999
	999
FERDINAND	What makes treason here?	999
	999
COSTARD	Nay, it makes nothing, sir.	999
	999
FERDINAND	If it mar nothing neither,	999
	The treason and you go in peace away together.	999
	999
JAQUENETTA	I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:	999
	Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Biron, read it over.	999
	999
	[Giving him the paper]	999
	999
	Where hadst thou it?	999
	999
JAQUENETTA	Of Costard.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Where hadst thou it?	999
	999
COSTARD	Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.	999
	999
	[BIRON tears the letter]	999
	999
FERDINAND	How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?	999
	999
BIRON	A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.	999
	999
DUMAIN	It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.	999
	999
	[Gathering up the pieces]	999
	999
BIRON	[To COSTARD]  Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were	999
	born to do me shame.	999
	Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.	999
	999
FERDINAND	What?	999
	999
BIRON	That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:	999
	He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,	999
	Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.	999
	O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Now the number is even.	999
	999
BIRON	True, true; we are four.	999
	Will these turtles be gone?	999
	999
FERDINAND	Hence, sirs; away!	999
	999
COSTARD	Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.	999
	999
	[Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA]	999
	999
BIRON	Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!	999
	As true we are as flesh and blood can be:	999
	The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;	999
	Young blood doth not obey an old decree:	999
	We cannot cross the cause why we were born;	999
	Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.	999
	999
FERDINAND	What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?	999
	999
BIRON	Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,	999
	That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,	999
	At the first opening of the gorgeous east,	999
	Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind	999
	Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?	999
	What peremptory eagle-sighted eye	999
	Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,	999
	That is not blinded by her majesty?	999
	999
FERDINAND	   What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?	999
	My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;	999
	She an attending star, scarce seen a light.	999
	999
BIRON	My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:	999
	O, but for my love, day would turn to night!	999
	Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty	999
	Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,	999
	Where several worthies make one dignity,	999
	Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.	999
	Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--	999
	Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:	999
	To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,	999
	She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.	999
	A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,	999
	Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:	999
	Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,	999
	And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:	999
	O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.	999
	999
FERDINAND	   By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.	999
	999
BIRON	Is ebony like her? O wood divine!	999
	A wife of such wood were felicity.	999
	O, who can give an oath? where is a book?	999
	That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,	999
	If that she learn not of her eye to look:	999
	No face is fair that is not full so black.	999
	999
FERDINAND	O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,	999
	The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;	999
	And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.	999
	999
BIRON	   Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.	999
	O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,	999
	It mourns that painting and usurping hair	999
	Should ravish doters with a false aspect;	999
	And therefore is she born to make black fair.	999
	Her favour turns the fashion of the days,	999
	For native blood is counted painting now;	999
	And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,	999
	Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.	999
	999
DUMAIN	To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	   And since her time are colliers counted bright.	999
	999
FERDINAND	And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.	999
	999
DUMAIN	   Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.	999
	999
BIRON	Your mistresses dare never come in rain,	999
	For fear their colours should be wash'd away.	999
	999
FERDINAND	'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,	999
	I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.	999
	999
BIRON	I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.	999
	999
FERDINAND	   No devil will fright thee then so much as she.	999
	999
DUMAIN	I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	   Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.	999
	999
BIRON	O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,	999
	Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!	999
	999
DUMAIN	O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies	999
	The street should see as she walk'd overhead.	999
	999
FERDINAND	But what of this? are we not all in love?	999
	999
BIRON	   Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove	999
	Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	   O, some authority how to proceed;	999
	Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Some salve for perjury.	999
	999
BIRON	'Tis more than need.	999
	Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.	999
	Consider what you first did swear unto,	999
	To fast, to study, and to see no woman;	999
	Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.	999
	Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;	999
	And abstinence engenders maladies.	999
	And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,	999
	In that each of you have forsworn his book,	999
	Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?	999
	For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,	999
	Have found the ground of study's excellence	999
	Without the beauty of a woman's face?	999
	[From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;	999
	They are the ground, the books, the academes	999
	From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire]	999
	Why, universal plodding poisons up	999
	The nimble spirits in the arteries,	999
	As motion and long-during action tires	999
	The sinewy vigour of the traveller.	999
	Now, for not looking on a woman's face,	999
	You have in that forsworn the use of eyes	999
	And study too, the causer of your vow;	999
	For where is any author in the world	999
	Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?	999
	Learning is but an adjunct to ourself	999
	And where we are our learning likewise is:	999
	Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,	999
	Do we not likewise see our learning there?	999
	O, we have made a vow to study, lords,	999
	And in that vow we have forsworn our books.	999
	For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,	999
	In leaden contemplation have found out	999
	Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes	999
	Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?	999
	Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;	999
	And therefore, finding barren practisers,	999
	Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:	999
	But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,	999
	Lives not alone immured in the brain;	999
	But, with the motion of all elements,	999
	Courses as swift as thought in every power,	999
	And gives to every power a double power,	999
	Above their functions and their offices.	999
	It adds a precious seeing to the eye;	999
	A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;	999
	A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,	999
	When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:	999
	Love's feeling is more soft and sensible	999
	Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;	999
	Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:	999
	For valour, is not Love a Hercules,	999
	Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?	999
	Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical	999
	As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:	999
	And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods	999
	Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.	999
	Never durst poet touch a pen to write	999
	Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;	999
	O, then his lines would ravish savage ears	999
	And plant in tyrants mild humility.	999
	From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:	999
	They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;	999
	They are the books, the arts, the academes,	999
	That show, contain and nourish all the world:	999
	Else none at all in ought proves excellent.	999
	Then fools you were these women to forswear,	999
	Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.	999
	For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,	999
	Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,	999
	Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,	999
	Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,	999
	Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,	999
	Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.	999
	It is religion to be thus forsworn,	999
	For charity itself fulfills the law,	999
	And who can sever love from charity?	999
	999
FERDINAND	Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!	999
	999
BIRON	Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;	999
	Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,	999
	In conflict that you get the sun of them.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:	999
	Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?	999
	999
FERDINAND	And win them too: therefore let us devise	999
	Some entertainment for them in their tents.	999
	999
BIRON	First, from the park let us conduct them thither;	999
	Then homeward every man attach the hand	999
	Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon	999
	We will with some strange pastime solace them,	999
	Such as the shortness of the time can shape;	999
	For revels, dances, masks and merry hours	999
	Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Away, away! no time shall be omitted	999
	That will betime, and may by us be fitted.	999
	999
BIRON	Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;	999
	And justice always whirls in equal measure:	999
	Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;	999
	If so, our copper buys no better treasure.	999

	999
SCENE I	The same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL]	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Satis quod sufficit.	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner	999
	have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without	999
	scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without	999
	impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-	999
	out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with	999
	a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-	999
	nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his	999
	discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye	999
	ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general	999
	behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is	999
	too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it	999
	were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	A most singular and choice epithet.	999
	999
	[Draws out his table-book]	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer	999
	than the staple of his argument. I abhor such	999
	fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and	999
	point-devise companions; such rackers of	999
	orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should	999
	say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,	999
	e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;	999
	half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh	999
	abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he	999
	would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of	999
	insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	Laus Deo, bene intelligo.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratch'd,	999
	'twill serve.	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	Videsne quis venit?	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Video, et gaudeo.	999
	999
	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, MOTH, and COSTARD]	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Chirrah!	999
	999
	[To MOTH]	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Quare chirrah, not sirrah?	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Men of peace, well encountered.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Most military sir, salutation.	999
	999
MOTH	[Aside to COSTARD]  They have been at a great feast	999
	of languages, and stolen the scraps.	999
	999
COSTARD	O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.	999
	I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;	999
	for thou art not so long by the head as	999
	honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier	999
	swallowed than a flap-dragon.	999
	999
MOTH	Peace! the peal begins.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	[To HOLOFERNES]  Monsieur, are you not lettered?	999
	999
MOTH	Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,	999
	b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.	999
	999
MOTH	Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Quis, quis, thou consonant?	999
	999
MOTH	The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or	999
	the fifth, if I.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	I will repeat them,--a, e, i,--	999
	999
MOTH	The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet	999
	touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and	999
	home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!	999
	999
MOTH	Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	What is the figure? what is the figure?	999
	999
MOTH	Horns.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.	999
	999
MOTH	Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about	999
	your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn.	999
	999
COSTARD	An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst	999
	have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very	999
	remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny	999
	purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an	999
	the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my	999
	bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!	999
	Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'	999
	ends, as they say.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the	999
	barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the	999
	charge-house on the top of the mountain?	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Or mons, the hill.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	I do, sans question.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and	999
	affection to congratulate the princess at her	999
	pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the	999
	rude multitude call the afternoon.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is	999
	liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:	999
	the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do	999
	assure you, sir, I do assure.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,	999
	I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is	999
	inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,	999
	remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy	999
	head: and among other important and most serious	999
	designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let	999
	that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his	999
	grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor	999
	shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally	999
	with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet	999
	heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no	999
	fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his	999
	greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of	999
	travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.	999
	The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do	999
	implore secrecy,--that the king would have me	999
	present the princess, sweet chuck, with some	999
	delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or	999
	antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the	999
	curate and your sweet self are good at such	999
	eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it	999
	were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to	999
	crave your assistance.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.	999
	Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some	999
	show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by	999
	our assistants, at the king's command, and this most	999
	gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before	999
	the princess; I say none so fit as to present the	999
	Nine Worthies.	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,	999
	Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great	999
	limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the	999
	page, Hercules,--	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for	999
	that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in	999
	minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a	999
	snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.	999
	999
MOTH	An excellent device! so, if any of the audience	999
	hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou	999
	crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an	999
	offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	For the rest of the Worthies?--	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	I will play three myself.	999
	999
MOTH	Thrice-worthy gentleman!	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Shall I tell you a thing?	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	We attend.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I	999
	beseech you, follow.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.	999
	999
DULL	Nor understood none neither, sir.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Allons! we will employ thee.	999
	999
DULL	I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play	999
	On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!	999

SCENE II	The same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA]	999
	999
PRINCESS	Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,	999
	If fairings come thus plentifully in:	999
	A lady wall'd about with diamonds!	999
	Look you what I have from the loving king.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Madame, came nothing else along with that?	999
	999
PRINCESS	Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme	999
	As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,	999
	Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,	999
	That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.	999
	999
ROSALINE	That was the way to make his godhead wax,	999
	For he hath been five thousand years a boy.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.	999
	999
ROSALINE	You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.	999
	999
KATHARINE	He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;	999
	And so she died: had she been light, like you,	999
	Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,	999
	She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:	999
	And so may you; for a light heart lives long.	999
	999
ROSALINE	What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?	999
	999
KATHARINE	A light condition in a beauty dark.	999
	999
ROSALINE	We need more light to find your meaning out.	999
	999
KATHARINE	You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;	999
	Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.	999
	999
KATHARINE	So do not you, for you are a light wench.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.	999
	999
KATHARINE	You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'	999
	999
PRINCESS	Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.	999
	But Rosaline, you have a favour too:	999
	Who sent it? and what is it?	999
	999
ROSALINE	I would you knew:	999
	An if my face were but as fair as yours,	999
	My favour were as great; be witness this.	999
	Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:	999
	The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,	999
	I were the fairest goddess on the ground:	999
	I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.	999
	O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!	999
	999
PRINCESS	Any thing like?	999
	999
ROSALINE	Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Fair as a text B in a copy-book.	999
	999
ROSALINE	'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,	999
	My red dominical, my golden letter:	999
	O, that your face were not so full of O's!	999
	999
KATHARINE	A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.	999
	999
PRINCESS	But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?	999
	999
KATHARINE	Madam, this glove.	999
	999
PRINCESS	                  Did he not send you twain?	999
	999
KATHARINE	Yes, madam, and moreover	999
	Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,	999
	A huge translation of hypocrisy,	999
	Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.	999
	999
MARIA	This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:	999
	The letter is too long by half a mile.	999
	999
PRINCESS	I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart	999
	The chain were longer and the letter short?	999
	999
MARIA	Ay, or I would these hands might never part.	999
	999
PRINCESS	We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.	999
	999
ROSALINE	They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.	999
	That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:	999
	O that I knew he were but in by the week!	999
	How I would make him fawn and beg and seek	999
	And wait the season and observe the times	999
	And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes	999
	And shape his service wholly to my hests	999
	And make him proud to make me proud that jests!	999
	So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state	999
	That he should be my fool and I his fate.	999
	999
PRINCESS	None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,	999
	As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,	999
	Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school	999
	And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.	999
	999
ROSALINE	The blood of youth burns not with such excess	999
	As gravity's revolt to wantonness.	999
	999
MARIA	Folly in fools bears not so strong a note	999
	As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;	999
	Since all the power thereof it doth apply	999
	To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.	999
	999
	[Enter BOYET]	999
	999
BOYET	O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?	999
	999
PRINCESS	Thy news Boyet?	999
	999
BOYET	                  Prepare, madam, prepare!	999
	Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are	999
	Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,	999
	Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:	999
	Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;	999
	Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they	999
	That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.	999
	999
BOYET	Under the cool shade of a sycamore	999
	I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;	999
	When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,	999
	Toward that shade I might behold addrest	999
	The king and his companions: warily	999
	I stole into a neighbour thicket by,	999
	And overheard what you shall overhear,	999
	That, by and by, disguised they will be here.	999
	Their herald is a pretty knavish page,	999
	That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:	999
	Action and accent did they teach him there;	999
	'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'	999
	And ever and anon they made a doubt	999
	Presence majestical would put him out,	999
	'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;	999
	Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'	999
	The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;	999
	I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'	999
	With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,	999
	Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:	999
	One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore	999
	A better speech was never spoke before;	999
	Another, with his finger and his thumb,	999
	Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'	999
	The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'	999
	The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.	999
	With that, they all did tumble on the ground,	999
	With such a zealous laughter, so profound,	999
	That in this spleen ridiculous appears,	999
	To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.	999
	999
PRINCESS	But what, but what, come they to visit us?	999
	999
BOYET	They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.	999
	Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.	999
	Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;	999
	And every one his love-feat will advance	999
	Unto his several mistress, which they'll know	999
	By favours several which they did bestow.	999
	999
PRINCESS	And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;	999
	For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;	999
	And not a man of them shall have the grace,	999
	Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.	999
	Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,	999
	And then the king will court thee for his dear;	999
	Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,	999
	So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.	999
	And change your favours too; so shall your loves	999
	Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.	999
	999
KATHARINE	But in this changing what is your intent?	999
	999
PRINCESS	The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:	999
	They do it but in mocking merriment;	999
	And mock for mock is only my intent.	999
	Their several counsels they unbosom shall	999
	To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal	999
	Upon the next occasion that we meet,	999
	With visages displayed, to talk and greet.	999
	999
ROSALINE	But shall we dance, if they desire to't?	999
	999
PRINCESS	No, to the death, we will not move a foot;	999
	Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,	999
	But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.	999
	999
BOYET	Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,	999
	And quite divorce his memory from his part.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt	999
	The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out	999
	There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,	999
	To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:	999
	So shall we stay, mocking intended game,	999
	And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.	999
	999
	[Trumpets sound within]	999
	999
BOYET	The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.	999
	999
	[The Ladies mask]	999
	999
	[Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND,	999
	BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits,	999
	and masked]	999
	999
MOTH	All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--	999
	999
BOYET	Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.	999
	999
MOTH	A holy parcel of the fairest dames.	999
	999
	[The Ladies turn their backs to him]	999
	999
	That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!	999
	999
BIRON	[Aside to MOTH]  Their eyes, villain, their eyes!	999
	999
MOTH	That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--	999
	999
BOYET	True; out indeed.	999
	999
MOTH	Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe	999
	Not to behold--	999
	999
BIRON	[Aside to MOTH]  Once to behold, rogue.	999
	999
MOTH	Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,	999
	--with your sun-beamed eyes--	999
	999
BOYET	They will not answer to that epithet;	999
	You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'	999
	999
MOTH	They do not mark me, and that brings me out.	999
	999
BIRON	Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!	999
	999
	[Exit MOTH]	999
	999
ROSALINE	What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:	999
	If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:	999
	That some plain man recount their purposes	999
	Know what they would.	999
	999
BOYET	What would you with the princess?	999
	999
BIRON	Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.	999
	999
ROSALINE	What would they, say they?	999
	999
BOYET	Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.	999
	999
BOYET	She says, you have it, and you may be gone.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Say to her, we have measured many miles	999
	To tread a measure with her on this grass.	999
	999
BOYET	They say, that they have measured many a mile	999
	To tread a measure with you on this grass.	999
	999
ROSALINE	It is not so. Ask them how many inches	999
	Is in one mile: if they have measured many,	999
	The measure then of one is easily told.	999
	999
BOYET	If to come hither you have measured miles,	999
	And many miles, the princess bids you tell	999
	How many inches doth fill up one mile.	999
	999
BIRON	Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.	999
	999
BOYET	She hears herself.	999
	999
ROSALINE	                  How many weary steps,	999
	Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,	999
	Are number'd in the travel of one mile?	999
	999
BIRON	We number nothing that we spend for you:	999
	Our duty is so rich, so infinite,	999
	That we may do it still without accompt.	999
	Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,	999
	That we, like savages, may worship it.	999
	999
ROSALINE	My face is but a moon, and clouded too.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!	999
	Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,	999
	Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.	999
	999
ROSALINE	O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;	999
	Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.	999
	Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.	999
	999
	[Music plays]	999
	999
	Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?	999
	999
ROSALINE	You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.	999
	The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Our ears vouchsafe it.	999
	999
FERDINAND	But your legs should do it.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Since you are strangers and come here by chance,	999
	We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Why take we hands, then?	999
	999
ROSALINE	Only to part friends:	999
	Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.	999
	999
FERDINAND	More measure of this measure; be not nice.	999
	999
ROSALINE	We can afford no more at such a price.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?	999
	999
ROSALINE	Your absence only.	999
	999
FERDINAND	                  That can never be.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;	999
	Twice to your visor, and half once to you.	999
	999
FERDINAND	If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.	999
	999
ROSALINE	In private, then.	999
	999
FERDINAND	                  I am best pleased with that.	999
	999
	[They converse apart]	999
	999
BIRON	White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.	999
	999
BIRON	Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,	999
	Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!	999
	There's half-a-dozen sweets.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Seventh sweet, adieu:	999
	Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.	999
	999
BIRON	One word in secret.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Let it not be sweet.	999
	999
BIRON	Thou grievest my gall.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Gall! bitter.	999
	999
BIRON	Therefore meet.	999
	999
	[They converse apart]	999
	999
DUMAIN	Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?	999
	999
MARIA	Name it.	999
	999
DUMAIN	       Fair lady,--	999
	999
MARIA	Say you so? Fair lord,--	999
	Take that for your fair lady.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Please it you,	999
	As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.	999
	999
	[They converse apart]	999
	999
KATHARINE	What, was your vizard made without a tongue?	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	I know the reason, lady, why you ask.	999
	999
KATHARINE	O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	You have a double tongue within your mask,	999
	And would afford my speechless vizard half.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	A calf, fair lady!	999
	999
KATHARINE	                  No, a fair lord calf.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	Let's part the word.	999
	999
KATHARINE	No, I'll not be your half	999
	Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!	999
	Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	One word in private with you, ere I die.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.	999
	999
	[They converse apart]	999
	999
BOYET	The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen	999
	As is the razor's edge invisible,	999
	Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,	999
	Above the sense of sense; so sensible	999
	Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings	999
	Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.	999
	999
BIRON	By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!	999
	999
FERDINAND	Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.	999
	999
	[Exeunt FERDINAND, Lords, and Blackamoors]	999
	999
	Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?	999
	999
BOYET	Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.	999
	999
PRINCESS	O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!	999
	Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?	999
	Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?	999
	This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.	999
	999
ROSALINE	O, they were all in lamentable cases!	999
	The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Biron did swear himself out of all suit.	999
	999
MARIA	Dumain was at my service, and his sword:	999
	No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;	999
	And trow you what he called me?	999
	999
PRINCESS	Qualm, perhaps.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Yes, in good faith.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Go, sickness as thou art!	999
	999
ROSALINE	Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.	999
	But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.	999
	999
PRINCESS	And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.	999
	999
KATHARINE	And Longaville was for my service born.	999
	999
MARIA	Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.	999
	999
BOYET	Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:	999
	Immediately they will again be here	999
	In their own shapes; for it can never be	999
	They will digest this harsh indignity.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Will they return?	999
	999
BOYET	                  They will, they will, God knows,	999
	And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:	999
	Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,	999
	Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.	999
	999
PRINCESS	How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.	999
	999
BOYET	Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;	999
	Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,	999
	Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,	999
	If they return in their own shapes to woo?	999
	999
ROSALINE	Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,	999
	Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:	999
	Let us complain to them what fools were here,	999
	Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;	999
	And wonder what they were and to what end	999
	Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd	999
	And their rough carriage so ridiculous,	999
	Should be presented at our tent to us.	999
	999
BOYET	Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PRINCESS, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIA]	999
	999
	[Re-enter FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN,	999
	in their proper habits]	999
	999
FERDINAND	Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?	999
	999
BOYET	Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty	999
	Command me any service to her thither?	999
	999
FERDINAND	That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.	999
	999
BOYET	I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BIRON	This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,	999
	And utters it again when God doth please:	999
	He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares	999
	At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;	999
	And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,	999
	Have not the grace to grace it with such show.	999
	This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;	999
	Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;	999
	A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he	999
	That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;	999
	This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,	999
	That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice	999
	In honourable terms: nay, he can sing	999
	A mean most meanly; and in ushering	999
	Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;	999
	The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:	999
	This is the flower that smiles on every one,	999
	To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;	999
	And consciences, that will not die in debt,	999
	Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.	999
	999
FERDINAND	A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,	999
	That put Armado's page out of his part!	999
	999
BIRON	See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou	999
	Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?	999
	999
	[Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET, ROSALINE,	999
	MARIA, and KATHARINE]	999
	999
FERDINAND	All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!	999
	999
PRINCESS	'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Construe my speeches better, if you may.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Then wish me better; I will give you leave.	999
	999
FERDINAND	We came to visit you, and purpose now	999
	To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.	999
	999
PRINCESS	This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:	999
	Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:	999
	The virtue of your eye must break my oath.	999
	999
PRINCESS	You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;	999
	For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.	999
	Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure	999
	As the unsullied lily, I protest,	999
	A world of torments though I should endure,	999
	I would not yield to be your house's guest;	999
	So much I hate a breaking cause to be	999
	Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.	999
	999
FERDINAND	O, you have lived in desolation here,	999
	Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;	999
	We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:	999
	A mess of Russians left us but of late.	999
	999
FERDINAND	How, madam! Russians!	999
	999
PRINCESS	Ay, in truth, my lord;	999
	Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:	999
	My lady, to the manner of the days,	999
	In courtesy gives undeserving praise.	999
	We four indeed confronted were with four	999
	In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,	999
	And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,	999
	They did not bless us with one happy word.	999
	I dare not call them fools; but this I think,	999
	When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.	999
	999
BIRON	This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,	999
	Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,	999
	With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,	999
	By light we lose light: your capacity	999
	Is of that nature that to your huge store	999
	Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.	999
	999
ROSALINE	This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--	999
	999
BIRON	I am a fool, and full of poverty.	999
	999
ROSALINE	But that you take what doth to you belong,	999
	It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.	999
	999
BIRON	O, I am yours, and all that I possess!	999
	999
ROSALINE	All the fool mine?	999
	999
BIRON	                  I cannot give you less.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Which of the vizards was it that you wore?	999
	999
BIRON	Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?	999
	999
ROSALINE	There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case	999
	That hid the worse and show'd the better face.	999
	999
FERDINAND	We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Let us confess and turn it to a jest.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?	999
	999
ROSALINE	Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?	999
	Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.	999
	999
BIRON	Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.	999
	Can any face of brass hold longer out?	999
	Here stand I	lady, dart thy skill at me;	999
	Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;	999
	Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;	999
	Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;	999
	And I will wish thee never more to dance,	999
	Nor never more in Russian habit wait.	999
	O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,	999
	Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,	999
	Nor never come in vizard to my friend,	999
	Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!	999
	Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,	999
	Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,	999
	Figures pedantical; these summer-flies	999
	Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:	999
	I do forswear them; and I here protest,	999
	By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--	999
	Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd	999
	In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:	999
	And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--	999
	My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Sans sans, I pray you.	999
	999
BIRON	Yet I have a trick	999
	Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;	999
	I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:	999
	Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;	999
	They are infected; in their hearts it lies;	999
	They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;	999
	These lords are visited; you are not free,	999
	For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.	999
	999
PRINCESS	No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.	999
	999
BIRON	Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.	999
	999
ROSALINE	It is not so; for how can this be true,	999
	That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?	999
	999
BIRON	Peace! for I will not have to do with you.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.	999
	999
BIRON	Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression	999
	Some fair excuse.	999
	999
PRINCESS	                  The fairest is confession.	999
	Were not you here but even now disguised?	999
	999
FERDINAND	Madam, I was.	999
	999
PRINCESS	                  And were you well advised?	999
	999
FERDINAND	I was, fair madam.	999
	999
PRINCESS	                  When you then were here,	999
	What did you whisper in your lady's ear?	999
	999
FERDINAND	That more than all the world I did respect her.	999
	999
PRINCESS	When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Upon mine honour, no.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Peace, peace! forbear:	999
	Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.	999
	999
PRINCESS	I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,	999
	What did the Russian whisper in your ear?	999
	999
ROSALINE	Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear	999
	As precious eyesight, and did value me	999
	Above this world; adding thereto moreover	999
	That he would wed me, or else die my lover.	999
	999
PRINCESS	God give thee joy of him! the noble lord	999
	Most honourably doth unhold his word.	999
	999
FERDINAND	What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,	999
	I never swore this lady such an oath.	999
	999
ROSALINE	By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,	999
	You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.	999
	999
FERDINAND	My faith and this the princess I did give:	999
	I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;	999
	And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.	999
	What, will you have me, or your pearl again?	999
	999
BIRON	Neither of either; I remit both twain.	999
	I see the trick on't: here was a consent,	999
	Knowing aforehand of our merriment,	999
	To dash it like a Christmas comedy:	999
	Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,	999
	Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,	999
	That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick	999
	To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,	999
	Told our intents before; which once disclosed,	999
	The ladies did change favours: and then we,	999
	Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.	999
	Now, to our perjury to add more terror,	999
	We are again forsworn, in will and error.	999
	Much upon this it is: and might not you	999
	999
	[To BOYET]	999
	999
	Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?	999
	Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,	999
	And laugh upon the apple of her eye?	999
	And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,	999
	Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?	999
	You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;	999
	Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.	999
	You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye	999
	Wounds like a leaden sword.	999
	999
BOYET	Full merrily	999
	Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.	999
	999
BIRON	Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.	999
	999
	[Enter COSTARD]	999
	999
	Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.	999
	999
COSTARD	O Lord, sir, they would know	999
	Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.	999
	999
BIRON	What, are there but three?	999
	999
COSTARD	No, sir; but it is vara fine,	999
	For every one pursents three.	999
	999
BIRON	And three times thrice is nine.	999
	999
COSTARD	Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.	999
	You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know	999
	what we know:	999
	I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--	999
	999
BIRON	Is not nine.	999
	999
COSTARD	Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.	999
	999
BIRON	By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.	999
	999
COSTARD	O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living	999
	by reckoning, sir.	999
	999
BIRON	How much is it?	999
	999
COSTARD	O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,	999
	sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine	999
	own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man	999
	in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.	999
	999
BIRON	Art thou one of the Worthies?	999
	999
COSTARD	It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the	999
	Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of	999
	the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.	999
	999
BIRON	Go, bid them prepare.	999
	999
COSTARD	We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take	999
	some care.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FERDINAND	Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.	999
	999
BIRON	We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy	999
	To have one show worse than the king's and his company.	999
	999
FERDINAND	I say they shall not come.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:	999
	That sport best pleases that doth least know how:	999
	Where zeal strives to content, and the contents	999
	Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:	999
	Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,	999
	When great things labouring perish in their birth.	999
	999
BIRON	A right description of our sport, my lord.	999
	999
	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO]	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal	999
	sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.	999
	999
	[Converses apart with FERDINAND, and delivers him a paper]	999
	999
PRINCESS	Doth this man serve God?	999
	999
BIRON	Why ask you?	999
	999
PRINCESS	He speaks not like a man of God's making.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for,	999
	I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding	999
	fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we	999
	will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.	999
	I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FERDINAND	Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He	999
	presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the	999
	Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page,	999
	Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if	999
	these four Worthies in their first show thrive,	999
	These four will change habits, and present the other five.	999
	999
BIRON	There is five in the first show.	999
	999
FERDINAND	You are deceived; 'tis not so.	999
	999
BIRON	The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool	999
	and the boy:--	999
	Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again	999
	Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.	999
	999
FERDINAND	The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.	999
	999
	[Enter COSTARD, for Pompey]	999
	999
COSTARD	I Pompey am,--	999
	999
BOYET	                  You lie, you are not he.	999
	999
COSTARD	I Pompey am,--	999
	999
BOYET	                  With libbard's head on knee.	999
	999
BIRON	Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends	999
	with thee.	999
	999
COSTARD	I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--	999
	999
DUMAIN	The Great.	999
	999
COSTARD	It is, 'Great,' sir:--	999
		 Pompey surnamed the Great;	999
	That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make	999
	my foe to sweat:	999
	And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,	999
	And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,	999
	If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Great thanks, great Pompey.	999
	999
COSTARD	'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I	999
	made a little fault in 'Great.'	999
	999
BIRON	My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for Alexander]	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	When in the world I lived, I was the world's	999
	commander;	999
	By east, west, north, and south, I spread my	999
	conquering might:	999
	My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,--	999
	999
BOYET	Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.	999
	999
BIRON	Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.	999
	999
PRINCESS	The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander.	999
	999
SIR NATHANIEL	When in the world I lived, I was the world's	999
	commander,--	999
	999
BOYET	Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.	999
	999
BIRON	Pompey the Great,--	999
	999
COSTARD	Your servant, and Costard.	999
	999
BIRON	Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.	999
	999
COSTARD	[To SIR NATHANIEL]  O, sir, you have overthrown	999
	Alisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out of	999
	the painted cloth for this: your lion, that holds	999
	his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given	999
	to Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror,	999
	and afeard to speak! run away for shame, Alisander.	999
	999
	[SIR NATHANIEL retires]	999
	999
	There, an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; an	999
	honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a	999
	marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good	999
	bowler: but, for Alisander,--alas, you see how	999
	'tis,--a little o'erparted. But there are Worthies	999
	a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.	999
	999
	[Enter HOLOFERNES, for Judas; and MOTH, for Hercules]	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	   Great Hercules is presented by this imp,	999
	Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis;	999
	And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,	999
	Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.	999
	Quoniam he seemeth in minority,	999
	Ergo I come with this apology.	999
	Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.	999
	999
	[MOTH retires]	999
	999
	Judas I am,--	999
	999
DUMAIN	A Judas!	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Not Iscariot, sir.	999
	Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.	999
	999
BIRON	A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Judas I am,--	999
	999
DUMAIN	The more shame for you, Judas.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	What mean you, sir?	999
	999
BOYET	To make Judas hang himself.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	Begin, sir; you are my elder.	999
	999
BIRON	Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	I will not be put out of countenance.	999
	999
BIRON	Because thou hast no face.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	What is this?	999
	999
BOYET	A cittern-head.	999
	999
DUMAIN	The head of a bodkin.	999
	999
BIRON	A Death's face in a ring.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.	999
	999
BOYET	The pommel of Caesar's falchion.	999
	999
DUMAIN	The carved-bone face on a flask.	999
	999
BIRON	Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Ay, and in a brooch of lead.	999
	999
BIRON	Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.	999
	And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	You have put me out of countenance.	999
	999
BIRON	False; we have given thee faces.	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	But you have out-faced them all.	999
	999
BIRON	An thou wert a lion, we would do so.	999
	999
BOYET	Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.	999
	And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?	999
	999
DUMAIN	For the latter end of his name.	999
	999
BIRON	For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!	999
	999
HOLOFERNES	This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.	999
	999
BOYET	A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.	999
	999
	[HOLOFERNES retires]	999
	999
PRINCESS	Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!	999
	999
	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, for Hector]	999
	999
BIRON	Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.	999
	999
BOYET	But is this Hector?	999
	999
FERDINAND	I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	His leg is too big for Hector's.	999
	999
DUMAIN	More calf, certain.	999
	999
BOYET	No; he is best endued in the small.	999
	999
BIRON	This cannot be Hector.	999
	999
DUMAIN	He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,	999
	Gave Hector a gift,--	999
	999
DUMAIN	A gilt nutmeg.	999
	999
BIRON	A lemon.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	Stuck with cloves.	999
	999
DUMAIN	No, cloven.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Peace!--	999
	The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty	999
	Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;	999
	A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea	999
	From morn till night, out of his pavilion.	999
	I am that flower,--	999
	999
DUMAIN	That mint.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	That columbine.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,	999
	beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,	999
	he was a man. But I will forward with my device.	999
	999
	[To the PRINCESS]	999
	999
	Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.	999
	999
BOYET	[Aside to DUMAIN]  Loves her by the foot,--	999
	999
DUMAIN	[Aside to BOYET]  He may not by the yard.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--	999
	999
COSTARD	The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she	999
	is two months on her way.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	What meanest thou?	999
	999
COSTARD	Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor	999
	wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in	999
	her belly already: tis yours.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt	999
	die.	999
	999
COSTARD	Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is	999
	quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by	999
	him.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Most rare Pompey!	999
	999
BOYET	Renowned Pompey!	999
	999
BIRON	Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!	999
	Pompey the Huge!	999
	999
DUMAIN	Hector trembles.	999
	999
BIRON	Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them	999
	on! stir them on!	999
	999
DUMAIN	Hector will challenge him.	999
	999
BIRON	Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will	999
	sup a flea.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	By the north pole, I do challenge thee.	999
	999
COSTARD	I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man:	999
	I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,	999
	let me borrow my arms again.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Room for the incensed Worthies!	999
	999
COSTARD	I'll do it in my shirt.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Most resolute Pompey!	999
	999
MOTH	Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you	999
	not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean	999
	you? You will lose your reputation.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat	999
	in my shirt.	999
	999
DUMAIN	You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet bloods, I both may and will.	999
	999
BIRON	What reason have you for't?	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go	999
	woolward for penance.	999
	999
BOYET	True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of	999
	linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but	999
	a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next	999
	his heart for a favour.	999
	999
	[Enter MERCADE]	999
	999
MERCADE	God save you, madam!	999
	999
PRINCESS	Welcome, Mercade;	999
	But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.	999
	999
MERCADE	I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring	999
	Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--	999
	999
PRINCESS	Dead, for my life!	999
	999
MERCADE	Even so; my tale is told.	999
	999
BIRON	Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.	999
	999
DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have	999
	seen the day of wrong through the little hole of	999
	discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Worthies]	999
	999
FERDINAND	How fares your majesty?	999
	999
PRINCESS	Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.	999
	999
PRINCESS	Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,	999
	For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,	999
	Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe	999
	In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide	999
	The liberal opposition of our spirits,	999
	If over-boldly we have borne ourselves	999
	In the converse of breath: your gentleness	999
	Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!	999
	A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:	999
	Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks	999
	For my great suit so easily obtain'd.	999
	999
FERDINAND	The extreme parts of time extremely forms	999
	All causes to the purpose of his speed,	999
	And often at his very loose decides	999
	That which long process could not arbitrate:	999
	And though the mourning brow of progeny	999
	Forbid the smiling courtesy of love	999
	The holy suit which fain it would convince,	999
	Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,	999
	Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it	999
	From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost	999
	Is not by much so wholesome-profitable	999
	As to rejoice at friends but newly found.	999
	999
PRINCESS	I understand you not: my griefs are double.	999
	999
BIRON	Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;	999
	And by these badges understand the king.	999
	For your fair sakes have we neglected time,	999
	Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,	999
	Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours	999
	Even to the opposed end of our intents:	999
	And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--	999
	As love is full of unbefitting strains,	999
	All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,	999
	Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,	999
	Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,	999
	Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll	999
	To every varied object in his glance:	999
	Which parti-coated presence of loose love	999
	Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,	999
	Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,	999
	Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,	999
	Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,	999
	Our love being yours, the error that love makes	999
	Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,	999
	By being once false for ever to be true	999
	To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:	999
	And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,	999
	Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.	999
	999
PRINCESS	We have received your letters full of love;	999
	Your favours, the ambassadors of love;	999
	And, in our maiden council, rated them	999
	At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,	999
	As bombast and as lining to the time:	999
	But more devout than this in our respects	999
	Have we not been; and therefore met your loves	999
	In their own fashion, like a merriment.	999
	999
DUMAIN	Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	So did our looks.	999
	999
ROSALINE	                  We did not quote them so.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Now, at the latest minute of the hour,	999
	Grant us your loves.	999
	999
PRINCESS	A time, methinks, too short	999
	To make a world-without-end bargain in.	999
	No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,	999
	Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:	999
	If for my love, as there is no such cause,	999
	You will do aught, this shall you do for me:	999
	Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed	999
	To some forlorn and naked hermitage,	999
	Remote from all the pleasures of the world;	999
	There stay until the twelve celestial signs	999
	Have brought about the annual reckoning.	999
	If this austere insociable life	999
	Change not your offer made in heat of blood;	999
	If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds	999
	Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,	999
	But that it bear this trial and last love;	999
	Then, at the expiration of the year,	999
	Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,	999
	And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine	999
	I will be thine; and till that instant shut	999
	My woeful self up in a mourning house,	999
	Raining the tears of lamentation	999
	For the remembrance of my father's death.	999
	If this thou do deny, let our hands part,	999
	Neither entitled in the other's heart.	999
	999
FERDINAND	If this, or more than this, I would deny,	999
	To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,	999
	The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!	999
	Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.	999
	999
BIRON	[And what to me, my love? and what to me?	999
	999
ROSALINE	You must be purged too, your sins are rack'd,	999
	You are attaint with faults and perjury:	999
	Therefore if you my favour mean to get,	999
	A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,	999
	But seek the weary beds of people sick]	999
	999
DUMAIN	But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?	999
	999
KATHARINE	A beard, fair health, and honesty;	999
	With three-fold love I wish you all these three.	999
	999
DUMAIN	O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?	999
	999
KATHARINE	Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day	999
	I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:	999
	Come when the king doth to my lady come;	999
	Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.	999
	999
DUMAIN	I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	What says Maria?	999
	999
MARIA	                  At the twelvemonth's end	999
	I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.	999
	999
LONGAVILLE	I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.	999
	999
MARIA	The liker you; few taller are so young.	999
	999
BIRON	Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;	999
	Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,	999
	What humble suit attends thy answer there:	999
	Impose some service on me for thy love.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,	999
	Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue	999
	Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,	999
	Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,	999
	Which you on all estates will execute	999
	That lie within the mercy of your wit.	999
	To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,	999
	And therewithal to win me, if you please,	999
	Without the which I am not to be won,	999
	You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day	999
	Visit the speechless sick and still converse	999
	With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,	999
	With all the fierce endeavor of your wit	999
	To enforce the pained impotent to smile.	999
	999
BIRON	To move wild laughter in the throat of death?	999
	It cannot be; it is impossible:	999
	Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.	999
	999
ROSALINE	Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,	999
	Whose influence is begot of that loose grace	999
	Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:	999
	A jest's prosperity lies in the ear	999
	Of him that hears it, never in the tongue	999
	Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,	999
	Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,	999
	Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,	999
	And I will have you and that fault withal;	999
	But if they will not, throw away that spirit,	999
	And I shall find you empty of that fault,	999
	Right joyful of your reformation.	999
	999
BIRON	A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,	999
	I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.	999
	999
PRINCESS	[To FERDINAND]  Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.	999
	999
FERDINAND	No, madam; we will bring you on your way.	999
	999
BIRON	Our wooing doth not end like an old play;	999
	Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy	999
	Might well have made our sport a comedy.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,	999
	And then 'twill end.	999
	999
BIRON	That's too long for a play.	999

DON	999
ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am	999
	a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the	999
	plough for her sweet love three years. But, most	999
	esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that	999
	the two learned men have compiled in praise of the	999
	owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the	999
	end of our show.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Call them forth quickly; we will do so.	999

	cuckoo. Ver, begin.	999
	999
	[THE SONG]	999
		999
	SPRING.	999
	When daisies pied and violets blue	999
	And lady-smocks all silver-white	999
	And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue	999
	Do paint the meadows with delight,	999
	The cuckoo then, on every tree,	999
	Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;	999
	Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,	999
	Unpleasing to a married ear!	999
	999
	When shepherds pipe on oaten straws	999
	And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,	999
	When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,	999
	And maidens bleach their summer smocks	999
	The cuckoo then, on every tree,	999
	Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;	999
	Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,	999
	Unpleasing to a married ear!	999
		999
	WINTER.	999
	When icicles hang by the wall	999
	And Dick the shepherd blows his nail	999
	And Tom bears logs into the hall	999
	And milk comes frozen home in pail,	999
	When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,	999
	Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;	999
	Tu-who, a merry note,	999
	While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.	999
	999
	When all aloud the wind doth blow	999
	And coughing drowns the parson's saw	999
	And birds sit brooding in the snow	999
	And Marian's nose looks red and raw,	999
	When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,	999
	Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;	999
	Tu-who, a merry note,	999
	While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE VINCENTIO, ESCALUS, Lords and	999
	Attendants]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Escalus.	999
	999
ESCALUS	My lord.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Of government the properties to unfold,	999
	Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;	999
	Since I am put to know that your own science	999
	Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice	999
	My strength can give you: then no more remains,	999
	But that to your sufficiency [           ]	999
	[                  ] as your Worth is able,	999
	And let them work. The nature of our people,	999
	Our city's institutions, and the terms	999
	For common justice, you're as pregnant in	999
	As art and practise hath enriched any	999
	That we remember. There is our commission,	999
	From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,	999
	I say, bid come before us Angelo.	999
	999
	[Exit an Attendant]	999
	999
	What figure of us think you he will bear?	999
	For you must know, we have with special soul	999
	Elected him our absence to supply,	999
	Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,	999
	And given his deputation all the organs	999
	Of our own power: what think you of it?	999
	999
ESCALUS	If any in Vienna be of worth	999
	To undergo such ample grace and honour,	999
	It is Lord Angelo.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	                  Look where he comes.	999
	999
	[Enter ANGELO]	999
	999
ANGELO	Always obedient to your grace's will,	999
	I come to know your pleasure.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Angelo,	999
	There is a kind of character in thy life,	999
	That to the observer doth thy history	999
	Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings	999
	Are not thine own so proper as to waste	999
	Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.	999
	Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,	999
	Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues	999
	Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike	999
	As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd	999
	But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends	999
	The smallest scruple of her excellence	999
	But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines	999
	Herself the glory of a creditor,	999
	Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech	999
	To one that can my part in him advertise;	999
	Hold therefore, Angelo:--	999
	In our remove be thou at full ourself;	999
	Mortality and mercy in Vienna	999
	Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,	999
	Though first in question, is thy secondary.	999
	Take thy commission.	999
	999
ANGELO	Now, good my lord,	999
	Let there be some more test made of my metal,	999
	Before so noble and so great a figure	999
	Be stamp'd upon it.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	No more evasion:	999
	We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice	999
	Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.	999
	Our haste from hence is of so quick condition	999
	That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd	999
	Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,	999
	As time and our concernings shall importune,	999
	How it goes with us, and do look to know	999
	What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;	999
	To the hopeful execution do I leave you	999
	Of your commissions.	999
	999
ANGELO	Yet give leave, my lord,	999
	That we may bring you something on the way.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	My haste may not admit it;	999
	Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do	999
	With any scruple; your scope is as mine own	999
	So to enforce or qualify the laws	999
	As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:	999
	I'll privily away. I love the people,	999
	But do not like to stage me to their eyes:	999
	Through it do well, I do not relish well	999
	Their loud applause and Aves vehement;	999
	Nor do I think the man of safe discretion	999
	That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.	999
	999
ANGELO	The heavens give safety to your purposes!	999
	999
ESCALUS	Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!	999
	999
DUKE	I thank you. Fare you well.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ESCALUS	I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave	999
	To have free speech with you; and it concerns me	999
	To look into the bottom of my place:	999
	A power I have, but of what strength and nature	999
	I am not yet instructed.	999
	999
ANGELO	'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,	999
	And we may soon our satisfaction have	999
	Touching that point.	999
	999
ESCALUS	I'll wait upon your honour.	999

SCENE II	A Street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen]	999
	999
LUCIO	If the duke with the other dukes come not to	999
	composition with the King of Hungary, why then all	999
	the dukes fall upon the king.	999
	999
First Gentleman	Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of	999
	Hungary's!	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Amen.	999
	999
LUCIO	Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that	999
	went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped	999
	one out of the table.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	'Thou shalt not steal'?	999
	999
LUCIO	Ay, that he razed.	999
	999
First Gentleman	Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and	999
	all the rest from their functions: they put forth	999
	to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in	999
	the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition	999
	well that prays for peace.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	I never heard any soldier dislike it.	999
	999
LUCIO	I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where	999
	grace was said.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	No? a dozen times at least.	999
	999
First Gentleman	What, in metre?	999
	999
LUCIO	In any proportion or in any language.	999
	999
First Gentleman	I think, or in any religion.	999
	999
LUCIO	Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all	999
	controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a	999
	wicked villain, despite of all grace.	999
	999
First Gentleman	Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.	999
	999
LUCIO	I grant; as there may between the lists and the	999
	velvet. Thou art the list.	999
	999
First Gentleman	And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt	999
	a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief	999
	be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou	999
	art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak	999
	feelingly now?	999
	999
LUCIO	I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful	999
	feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own	999
	confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I	999
	live, forget to drink after thee.	999
	999
First Gentleman	I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.	999
	999
LUCIO	Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I	999
	have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--	999
	999
Second Gentleman	To what, I pray?	999
	999
LUCIO	Judge.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	To three thousand dolours a year.	999
	999
First Gentleman	Ay, and more.	999
	999
LUCIO	A French crown more.	999
	999
First Gentleman	Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou	999
	art full of error; I am sound.	999
	999
LUCIO	Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as	999
	things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;	999
	impiety has made a feast of thee.	999
	999
	[Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE]	999
	999
First Gentleman	How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried	999
	to prison was worth five thousand of you all.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Who's that, I pray thee?	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.	999
	999
First Gentleman	Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw	999
	him carried away; and, which is more, within these	999
	three days his head to be chopped off.	999
	999
LUCIO	But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.	999
	Art thou sure of this?	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam	999
	Julietta with child.	999
	999
LUCIO	Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two	999
	hours since, and he was ever precise in	999
	promise-keeping.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Besides, you know, it draws something near to the	999
	speech we had to such a purpose.	999
	999
First Gentleman	But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.	999
	999
LUCIO	Away! let's go learn the truth of it.	999
	999
	[Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen]	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what	999
	with the gallows and what with poverty, I am	999
	custom-shrunk.	999
	999
	[Enter POMPEY]	999
	999
	How now! what's the news with you?	999
	999
POMPEY	Yonder man is carried to prison.	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	Well; what has he done?	999
	999
POMPEY	A woman.	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	But what's his offence?	999
	999
POMPEY	Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	What, is there a maid with child by him?	999
	999
POMPEY	No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have	999
	not heard of the proclamation, have you?	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	What proclamation, man?	999
	999
POMPEY	All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	And what shall become of those in the city?	999
	999
POMPEY	They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,	999
	but that a wise burgher put in for them.	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be	999
	pulled down?	999
	999
POMPEY	To the ground, mistress.	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!	999
	What shall become of me?	999
	999
POMPEY	Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no	999
	clients: though you change your place, you need not	999
	change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.	999
	Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that	999
	have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you	999
	will be considered.	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.	999
	999
POMPEY	Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to	999
	prison; and there's Madam Juliet.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers]	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?	999
	Bear me to prison, where I am committed.	999
	999
Provost	I do it not in evil disposition,	999
	But from Lord Angelo by special charge.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Thus can the demigod Authority	999
	Make us pay down for our offence by weight	999
	The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;	999
	On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.	999
	999
	[Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen]	999
	999
LUCIO	Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:	999
	As surfeit is the father of much fast,	999
	So every scope by the immoderate use	999
	Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,	999
	Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,	999
	A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.	999
	999
LUCIO	If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would	999
	send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say	999
	the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom	999
	as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy	999
	offence, Claudio?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	What but to speak of would offend again.	999
	999
LUCIO	What, is't murder?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	No.	999
	999
LUCIO	Lechery?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Call it so.	999
	999
Provost	Away, sir! you must go.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.	999
	999
LUCIO	A hundred, if they'll do you any good.	999
	Is lechery so look'd after?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract	999
	I got possession of Julietta's bed:	999
	You know the lady; she is fast my wife,	999
	Save that we do the denunciation lack	999
	Of outward order: this we came not to,	999
	Only for propagation of a dower	999
	Remaining in the coffer of her friends,	999
	From whom we thought it meet to hide our love	999
	Till time had made them for us. But it chances	999
	The stealth of our most mutual entertainment	999
	With character too gross is writ on Juliet.	999
	999
LUCIO	With child, perhaps?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Unhappily, even so.	999
	And the new deputy now for the duke--	999
	Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,	999
	Or whether that the body public be	999
	A horse whereon the governor doth ride,	999
	Who, newly in the seat, that it may know	999
	He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;	999
	Whether the tyranny be in his place,	999
	Or in his emmence that fills it up,	999
	I stagger in:--but this new governor	999
	Awakes me all the enrolled penalties	999
	Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall	999
	So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round	999
	And none of them been worn; and, for a name,	999
	Now puts the drowsy and neglected act	999
	Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.	999
	999
LUCIO	I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on	999
	thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,	999
	may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to	999
	him.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I have done so, but he's not to be found.	999
	I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:	999
	This day my sister should the cloister enter	999
	And there receive her approbation:	999
	Acquaint her with the danger of my state:	999
	Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends	999
	To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:	999
	I have great hope in that; for in her youth	999
	There is a prone and speechless dialect,	999
	Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art	999
	When she will play with reason and discourse,	999
	And well she can persuade.	999
	999
LUCIO	I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the	999
	like, which else would stand under grievous	999
	imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I	999
	would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a	999
	game of tick-tack. I'll to her.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I thank you, good friend Lucio.	999
	999
LUCIO	Within two hours.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	                  Come, officer, away!	999

	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	No, holy father; throw away that thought;	999
	Believe not that the dribbling dart of love	999
	Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee	999
	To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose	999
	More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends	999
	Of burning youth.	999
	999
FRIAR THOMAS	                  May your grace speak of it?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	My holy sir, none better knows than you	999
	How I have ever loved the life removed	999
	And held in idle price to haunt assemblies	999
	Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.	999
	I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,	999
	A man of stricture and firm abstinence,	999
	My absolute power and place here in Vienna,	999
	And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;	999
	For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,	999
	And so it is received. Now, pious sir,	999
	You will demand of me why I do this?	999
	999
FRIAR THOMAS	Gladly, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	We have strict statutes and most biting laws.	999
	The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,	999
	Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;	999
	Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,	999
	That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,	999
	Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,	999
	Only to stick it in their children's sight	999
	For terror, not to use, in time the rod	999
	Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,	999
	Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;	999
	And liberty plucks justice by the nose;	999
	The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart	999
	Goes all decorum.	999
	999
FRIAR THOMAS	                  It rested in your grace	999
	To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:	999
	And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd	999
	Than in Lord Angelo.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	I do fear, too dreadful:	999
	Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,	999
	'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them	999
	For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,	999
	When evil deeds have their permissive pass	999
	And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,	999
	I have on Angelo imposed the office;	999
	Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,	999
	And yet my nature never in the fight	999
	To do in slander. And to behold his sway,	999
	I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,	999
	Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,	999
	Supply me with the habit and instruct me	999
	How I may formally in person bear me	999
	Like a true friar. More reasons for this action	999
	At our more leisure shall I render you;	999
	Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;	999
	Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses	999
	That his blood flows, or that his appetite	999
	Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,	999
	If power change purpose, what our seemers be.	999

	999
ISABELLA	And have you nuns no farther privileges?	999
	999
FRANCISCA	Are not these large enough?	999
	999
ISABELLA	Yes, truly; I speak not as desiring more;	999
	But rather wishing a more strict restraint	999
	Upon the sisterhood, the votarists of Saint Clare.	999
	999
LUCIO	[Within]  Ho! Peace be in this place!	999
	999
ISABELLA	Who's that which calls?	999
	999
FRANCISCA	It is a man's voice. Gentle Isabella,	999
	Turn you the key, and know his business of him;	999
	You may, I may not; you are yet unsworn.	999
	When you have vow'd, you must not speak with men	999
	But in the presence of the prioress:	999
	Then, if you speak, you must not show your face,	999
	Or, if you show your face, you must not speak.	999
	He calls again; I pray you, answer him.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ISABELLA	Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls	999
	999
	[Enter LUCIO]	999
	999
LUCIO	Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses	999
	Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me	999
	As bring me to the sight of Isabella,	999
	A novice of this place and the fair sister	999
	To her unhappy brother Claudio?	999
	999
ISABELLA	Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,	999
	The rather for I now must make you know	999
	I am that Isabella and his sister.	999
	999
LUCIO	Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:	999
	Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Woe me! for what?	999
	999
LUCIO	For that which, if myself might be his judge,	999
	He should receive his punishment in thanks:	999
	He hath got his friend with child.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Sir, make me not your story.	999
	999
LUCIO	It is true.	999
	I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin	999
	With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,	999
	Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:	999
	I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.	999
	By your renouncement an immortal spirit,	999
	And to be talk'd with in sincerity,	999
	As with a saint.	999
	999
ISABELLA	You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.	999
	999
LUCIO	Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:	999
	Your brother and his lover have embraced:	999
	As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time	999
	That from the seedness the bare fallow brings	999
	To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb	999
	Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?	999
	999
LUCIO	Is she your cousin?	999
	999
ISABELLA	Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names	999
	By vain though apt affection.	999
	999
LUCIO	She it is.	999
	999
ISABELLA	O, let him marry her.	999
	999
LUCIO	This is the point.	999
	The duke is very strangely gone from hence;	999
	Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,	999
	In hand and hope of action: but we do learn	999
	By those that know the very nerves of state,	999
	His givings-out were of an infinite distance	999
	From his true-meant design. Upon his place,	999
	And with full line of his authority,	999
	Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood	999
	Is very snow-broth; one who never feels	999
	The wanton stings and motions of the sense,	999
	But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge	999
	With profits of the mind, study and fast.	999
	He--to give fear to use and liberty,	999
	Which have for long run by the hideous law,	999
	As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,	999
	Under whose heavy sense your brother's life	999
	Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;	999
	And follows close the rigour of the statute,	999
	To make him an example. All hope is gone,	999
	Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer	999
	To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business	999
	'Twixt you and your poor brother.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Doth he so seek his life?	999
	999
LUCIO	Has censured him	999
	Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath	999
	A warrant for his execution.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Alas! what poor ability's in me	999
	To do him good?	999
	999
LUCIO	                  Assay the power you have.	999
	999
ISABELLA	My power? Alas, I doubt--	999
	999
LUCIO	Our doubts are traitors	999
	And make us lose the good we oft might win	999
	By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,	999
	And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,	999
	Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,	999
	All their petitions are as freely theirs	999
	As they themselves would owe them.	999
	999
ISABELLA	I'll see what I can do.	999
	999
LUCIO	But speedily.	999
	999
ISABELLA	I will about it straight;	999
	No longer staying but to give the mother	999
	Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:	999
	Commend me to my brother: soon at night	999
	I'll send him certain word of my success.	999
	999
LUCIO	I take my leave of you.	999

	999
SCENE I	A hall In ANGELO's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost,	999
	Officers, and other Attendants, behind]	999
	999
ANGELO	We must not make a scarecrow of the law,	999
	Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,	999
	And let it keep one shape, till custom make it	999
	Their perch and not their terror.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Ay, but yet	999
	Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,	999
	Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman	999
	Whom I would save, had a most noble father!	999
	Let but your honour know,	999
	Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,	999
	That, in the working of your own affections,	999
	Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,	999
	Or that the resolute acting of your blood	999
	Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,	999
	Whether you had not sometime in your life	999
	Err'd in this point which now you censure him,	999
	And pull'd the law upon you.	999
	999
ANGELO	'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,	999
	Another thing to fall. I not deny,	999
	The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,	999
	May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two	999
	Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,	999
	That justice seizes: what know the laws	999
	That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,	999
	The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't	999
	Because we see it; but what we do not see	999
	We tread upon, and never think of it.	999
	You may not so extenuate his offence	999
	For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,	999
	When I, that censure him, do so offend,	999
	Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,	999
	And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Be it as your wisdom will.	999
	999
ANGELO	Where is the provost?	999
	999
Provost	Here, if it like your honour.	999
	999
ANGELO	See that Claudio	999
	Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:	999
	Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;	999
	For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.	999
	999
	[Exit Provost]	999
	999
ESCALUS	[Aside]  Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!	999
	Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:	999
	Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:	999
	And some condemned for a fault alone.	999
	999
	[Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY]	999
	999
ELBOW	Come, bring them away: if these be good people in	999
	a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in	999
	common houses, I know no law: bring them away.	999
	999
ANGELO	How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?	999
	999
ELBOW	If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's	999
	constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon	999
	justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good	999
	honour two notorious benefactors.	999
	999
ANGELO	Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are	999
	they not malefactors?	999
	999
ELBOW	If it? please your honour, I know not well what they	999
	are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure	999
	of; and void of all profanation in the world that	999
	good Christians ought to have.	999
	999
ESCALUS	This comes off well; here's a wise officer.	999
	999
ANGELO	Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your	999
	name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?	999
	999
POMPEY	He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.	999
	999
ANGELO	What are you, sir?	999
	999
ELBOW	He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that	999
	serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they	999
	say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she	999
	professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.	999
	999
ESCALUS	How know you that?	999
	999
ELBOW	My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--	999
	999
ESCALUS	How? thy wife?	999
	999
ELBOW	Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--	999
	999
ESCALUS	Dost thou detest her therefore?	999
	999
ELBOW	I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as	999
	she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,	999
	it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.	999
	999
ESCALUS	How dost thou know that, constable?	999
	999
ELBOW	Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman	999
	cardinally given, might have been accused in	999
	fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.	999
	999
ESCALUS	By the woman's means?	999
	999
ELBOW	Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she	999
	spit in his face, so she defied him.	999
	999
POMPEY	Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.	999
	999
ELBOW	Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable	999
	man; prove it.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Do you hear how he misplaces?	999
	999
POMPEY	Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,	999
	saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;	999
	sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very	999
	distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a	999
	dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen	999
	such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very	999
	good dishes,--	999
	999
ESCALUS	Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.	999
	999
POMPEY	No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in	999
	the right: but to the point. As I say, this	999
	Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and	999
	being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for	999
	prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,	999
	Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the	999
	rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very	999
	honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could	999
	not give you three-pence again.	999
	999
FROTH	No, indeed.	999
	999
POMPEY	Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,	999
	cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--	999
	999
FROTH	Ay, so I did indeed.	999
	999
POMPEY	Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be	999
	remembered, that such a one and such a one were past	999
	cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very	999
	good diet, as I told you,--	999
	999
FROTH	All this is true.	999
	999
POMPEY	Why, very well, then,--	999
	999
ESCALUS	Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What	999
	was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to	999
	complain of? Come me to what was done to her.	999
	999
POMPEY	Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.	999
	999
ESCALUS	No, sir, nor I mean it not.	999
	999
POMPEY	Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's	999
	leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth	999
	here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose	999
	father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,	999
	Master Froth?	999
	999
FROTH	All-hallond eve.	999
	999
POMPEY	Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,	999
	sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in	999
	the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight	999
	to sit, have you not?	999
	999
FROTH	I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.	999
	999
POMPEY	Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.	999
	999
ANGELO	This will last out a night in Russia,	999
	When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.	999
	And leave you to the hearing of the cause;	999
	Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.	999
	999
ESCALUS	I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.	999
	999
	[Exit ANGELO]	999
	999
	Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?	999
	999
POMPEY	Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.	999
	999
ELBOW	I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.	999
	999
POMPEY	I beseech your honour, ask me.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?	999
	999
POMPEY	I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.	999
	Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a	999
	good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?	999
	999
ESCALUS	Ay, sir, very well.	999
	999
POMPEY	Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Well, I do so.	999
	999
POMPEY	Doth your honour see any harm in his face?	999
	999
ESCALUS	Why, no.	999
	999
POMPEY	I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst	999
	thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the	999
	worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the	999
	constable's wife any harm? I would know that of	999
	your honour.	999
	999
ESCALUS	He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?	999
	999
ELBOW	First, an it like you, the house is a respected	999
	house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his	999
	mistress is a respected woman.	999
	999
POMPEY	By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected	999
	person than any of us all.	999
	999
ELBOW	Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the	999
	time has yet to come that she was ever respected	999
	with man, woman, or child.	999
	999
POMPEY	Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is	999
	this true?	999
	999
ELBOW	O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked	999
	Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married	999
	to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she	999
	with me, let not your worship think me the poor	999
	duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or	999
	I'll have mine action of battery on thee.	999
	999
ESCALUS	If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your	999
	action of slander too.	999
	999
ELBOW	Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't	999
	your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?	999
	999
ESCALUS	Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him	999
	that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him	999
	continue in his courses till thou knowest what they	999
	are.	999
	999
ELBOW	Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou	999
	wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art	999
	to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Where were you born, friend?	999
	999
FROTH	Here in Vienna, sir.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Are you of fourscore pounds a year?	999
	999
FROTH	Yes, an't please you, sir.	999
	999
ESCALUS	So. What trade are you of, sir?	999
	999
POMPHEY	Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Your mistress' name?	999
	999
POMPHEY	Mistress Overdone.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Hath she had any more than one husband?	999
	999
POMPEY	Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master	999
	Froth, I would not have you acquainted with	999
	tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you	999
	will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no	999
	more of you.	999
	999
FROTH	I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never	999
	come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn	999
	in.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit FROTH]	999
	999
	Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your	999
	name, Master tapster?	999
	999
POMPEY	Pompey.	999
	999
ESCALUS	What else?	999
	999
POMPEY	Bum, sir.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;	999
	so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the	999
	Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,	999
	howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you	999
	not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.	999
	999
POMPEY	Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.	999
	999
ESCALUS	How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What	999
	do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?	999
	999
POMPEY	If the law would allow it, sir.	999
	999
ESCALUS	But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall	999
	not be allowed in Vienna.	999
	999
POMPEY	Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the	999
	youth of the city?	999
	999
ESCALUS	No, Pompey.	999
	999
POMPEY	Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.	999
	If your worship will take order for the drabs and	999
	the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.	999
	999
ESCALUS	There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:	999
	it is but heading and hanging.	999
	999
POMPEY	If you head and hang all that offend that way but	999
	for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a	999
	commission for more heads: if this law hold in	999
	Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it	999
	after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this	999
	come to pass, say Pompey told you so.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your	999
	prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find	999
	you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;	999
	no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,	999
	I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd	999
	Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall	999
	have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.	999
	999
POMPEY	I thank your worship for your good counsel:	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall	999
	better determine.	999
	Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:	999
	The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ESCALUS	Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master	999
	constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?	999
	999
ELBOW	Seven year and a half, sir.	999
	999
ESCALUS	I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had	999
	continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?	999
	999
ELBOW	And a half, sir.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you	999
	wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men	999
	in your ward sufficient to serve it?	999
	999
ELBOW	Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they	999
	are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I	999
	do it for some piece of money, and go through with	999
	all.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,	999
	the most sufficient of your parish.	999
	999
ELBOW	To your worship's house, sir?	999
	999
ESCALUS	To my house. Fare you well.	999
	999
	[Exit ELBOW]	999
	999
	What's o'clock, think you?	999
	999
Justice	Eleven, sir.	999
	999
ESCALUS	I pray you home to dinner with me.	999
	999
Justice	I humbly thank you.	999
	999
ESCALUS	It grieves me for the death of Claudio;	999
	But there's no remedy.	999
	999
Justice	Lord Angelo is severe.	999
	999
ESCALUS	It is but needful:	999
	Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;	999
	Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:	999
	But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.	999
	Come, sir.	999

	999
SCENE II	Another room in the same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Provost and a Servant]	999
	999
Servant	He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight	999
	I'll tell him of you.	999
	999
Provost	Pray you, do.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant]	999
	999
		                  I'll know	999
	His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,	999
	He hath but as offended in a dream!	999
	All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he	999
	To die for't!	999
	999
	[Enter ANGELO]	999
	999
ANGELO	                  Now, what's the matter. Provost?	999
	999
Provost	Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?	999
	999
ANGELO	Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?	999
	Why dost thou ask again?	999
	999
Provost	Lest I might be too rash:	999
	Under your good correction, I have seen,	999
	When, after execution, judgment hath	999
	Repented o'er his doom.	999
	999
ANGELO	Go to; let that be mine:	999
	Do you your office, or give up your place,	999
	And you shall well be spared.	999
	999
Provost	I crave your honour's pardon.	999
	What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?	999
	She's very near her hour.	999
	999
ANGELO	Dispose of her	999
	To some more fitter place, and that with speed.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Servant]	999
	999
Servant	Here is the sister of the man condemn'd	999
	Desires access to you.	999
	999
ANGELO	Hath he a sister?	999
	999
Provost	Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,	999
	And to be shortly of a sisterhood,	999
	If not already.	999
	999
ANGELO	                  Well, let her be admitted.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant]	999
	999
	See you the fornicatress be removed:	999
	Let have needful, but not lavish, means;	999
	There shall be order for't.	999
	999
	[Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO]	999
	999
Provost	God save your honour!	999
	999
ANGELO	Stay a little while.	999
	999
	[To ISABELLA]	999
	999
		You're welcome: what's your will?	999
	999
ISABELLA	I am a woeful suitor to your honour,	999
	Please but your honour hear me.	999
	999
ANGELO	Well; what's your suit?	999
	999
ISABELLA	There is a vice that most I do abhor,	999
	And most desire should meet the blow of justice;	999
	For which I would not plead, but that I must;	999
	For which I must not plead, but that I am	999
	At war 'twixt will and will not.	999
	999
ANGELO	Well; the matter?	999
	999
ISABELLA	I have a brother is condemn'd to die:	999
	I do beseech you, let it be his fault,	999
	And not my brother.	999
	999
Provost	[Aside]  Heaven give thee moving graces!	999
	999
ANGELO	Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?	999
	Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:	999
	Mine were the very cipher of a function,	999
	To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,	999
	And let go by the actor.	999
	999
ISABELLA	O just but severe law!	999
	I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!	999
	999
LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]  Give't not o'er so: to him	999
	again, entreat him;	999
	Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:	999
	You are too cold; if you should need a pin,	999
	You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:	999
	To him, I say!	999
	999
ISABELLA	Must he needs die?	999
	999
ANGELO	                  Maiden, no remedy.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,	999
	And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.	999
	999
ANGELO	I will not do't.	999
	999
ISABELLA	                  But can you, if you would?	999
	999
ANGELO	Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.	999
	999
ISABELLA	But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,	999
	If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse	999
	As mine is to him?	999
	999
ANGELO	                  He's sentenced; 'tis too late.	999
	999
LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]  You are too cold.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.	999
	May call it back again. Well, believe this,	999
	No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,	999
	Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,	999
	The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,	999
	Become them with one half so good a grace	999
	As mercy does.	999
	If he had been as you and you as he,	999
	You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,	999
	Would not have been so stern.	999
	999
ANGELO	Pray you, be gone.	999
	999
ISABELLA	I would to heaven I had your potency,	999
	And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?	999
	No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,	999
	And what a prisoner.	999
	999
LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]	999
	999
		Ay, touch him; there's the vein.	999
	999
ANGELO	Your brother is a forfeit of the law,	999
	And you but waste your words.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Alas, alas!	999
	Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;	999
	And He that might the vantage best have took	999
	Found out the remedy. How would you be,	999
	If He, which is the top of judgment, should	999
	But judge you as you are? O, think on that;	999
	And mercy then will breathe within your lips,	999
	Like man new made.	999
	999
ANGELO	                  Be you content, fair maid;	999
	It is the law, not I condemn your brother:	999
	Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,	999
	It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.	999
	999
ISABELLA	To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!	999
	He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens	999
	We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven	999
	With less respect than we do minister	999
	To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;	999
	Who is it that hath died for this offence?	999
	There's many have committed it.	999
	999
LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]           Ay, well said.	999
	999
ANGELO	The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:	999
	Those many had not dared to do that evil,	999
	If the first that did the edict infringe	999
	Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake	999
	Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,	999
	Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,	999
	Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,	999
	And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,	999
	Are now to have no successive degrees,	999
	But, ere they live, to end.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Yet show some pity.	999
	999
ANGELO	I show it most of all when I show justice;	999
	For then I pity those I do not know,	999
	Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;	999
	And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,	999
	Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;	999
	Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.	999
	999
ISABELLA	So you must be the first that gives this sentence,	999
	And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent	999
	To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous	999
	To use it like a giant.	999
	999
LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]   That's well said.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Could great men thunder	999
	As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,	999
	For every pelting, petty officer	999
	Would use his heaven for thunder;	999
	Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,	999
	Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt	999
	Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak	999
	Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,	999
	Drest in a little brief authority,	999
	Most ignorant of what he's most assured,	999
	His glassy essence, like an angry ape,	999
	Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven	999
	As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,	999
	Would all themselves laugh mortal.	999
	999
LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]  O, to him, to him, wench! he	999
	will relent;	999
	He's coming; I perceive 't.	999
	999
Provost	[Aside]  Pray heaven she win him!	999
	999
ISABELLA	We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:	999
	Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,	999
	But in the less foul profanation.	999
	999
LUCIO	Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.	999
	999
ISABELLA	That in the captain's but a choleric word,	999
	Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.	999
	999
LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]  Art avised o' that? more on 't.	999
	999
ANGELO	Why do you put these sayings upon me?	999
	999
ISABELLA	Because authority, though it err like others,	999
	Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,	999
	That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;	999
	Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know	999
	That's like my brother's fault: if it confess	999
	A natural guiltiness such as is his,	999
	Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue	999
	Against my brother's life.	999
	999
ANGELO	[Aside]                  She speaks, and 'tis	999
	Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Gentle my lord, turn back.	999
	999
ANGELO	I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.	999
	999
ANGELO	How! bribe me?	999
	999
ISABELLA	Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.	999
	999
LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]  You had marr'd all else.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,	999
	Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor	999
	As fancy values them; but with true prayers	999
	That shall be up at heaven and enter there	999
	Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,	999
	From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate	999
	To nothing temporal.	999
	999
ANGELO	Well; come to me to-morrow.	999
	999
LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]  Go to; 'tis well; away!	999
	999
ISABELLA	Heaven keep your honour safe!	999
	999
ANGELO	[Aside]	Amen:	999
	For I am that way going to temptation,	999
	Where prayers cross.	999
	999
ISABELLA	At what hour to-morrow	999
	Shall I attend your lordship?	999
	999
ANGELO	At any time 'fore noon.	999
	999
ISABELLA	'Save your honour!	999
	999
	[Exeunt ISABELLA, LUCIO, and Provost]	999
	999
ANGELO	                  From thee, even from thy virtue!	999
	What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?	999
	The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?	999
	Ha!	999
	Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I	999
	That, lying by the violet in the sun,	999
	Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,	999
	Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be	999
	That modesty may more betray our sense	999
	Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,	999
	Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary	999
	And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!	999
	What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?	999
	Dost thou desire her foully for those things	999
	That make her good? O, let her brother live!	999
	Thieves for their robbery have authority	999
	When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,	999
	That I desire to hear her speak again,	999
	And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?	999
	O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,	999
	With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous	999
	Is that temptation that doth goad us on	999
	To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,	999
	With all her double vigour, art and nature,	999
	Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid	999
	Subdues me quite. Even till now,	999
	When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.	999

SCENE III	A room in a prison.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter, severally, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as a	999
	friar, and Provost]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.	999
	999
Provost	I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Bound by my charity and my blest order,	999
	I come to visit the afflicted spirits	999
	Here in the prison. Do me the common right	999
	To let me see them and to make me know	999
	The nature of their crimes, that I may minister	999
	To them accordingly.	999
	999
Provost	I would do more than that, if more were needful.	999
	999
	[Enter JULIET]	999
	999
	Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,	999
	Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,	999
	Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;	999
	And he that got it, sentenced; a young man	999
	More fit to do another such offence	999
	Than die for this.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	When must he die?	999
	999
Provost	                  As I do think, to-morrow.	999
	I have provided for you: stay awhile,	999
	999
	[To JULIET]	999
	999
	And you shall be conducted.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?	999
	999
JULIET	I do; and bear the shame most patiently.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,	999
	And try your penitence, if it be sound,	999
	Or hollowly put on.	999
	999
JULIET	I'll gladly learn.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Love you the man that wrong'd you?	999
	999
JULIET	Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	So then it seems your most offenceful act	999
	Was mutually committed?	999
	999
JULIET	Mutually.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.	999
	999
JULIET	I do confess it, and repent it, father.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,	999
	As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,	999
	Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,	999
	Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,	999
	But as we stand in fear,--	999
	999
JULIET	I do repent me, as it is an evil,	999
	And take the shame with joy.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	There rest.	999
	Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,	999
	And I am going with instruction to him.	999
	Grace go with you, Benedicite!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
JULIET	Must die to-morrow! O injurious love,	999
	That respites me a life, whose very comfort	999
	Is still a dying horror!	999
	999
Provost	'Tis pity of him.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
SCENE IV	A room in ANGELO's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ANGELO]	999
	999
ANGELO	When I would pray and think, I think and pray	999
	To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;	999
	Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,	999
	Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,	999
	As if I did but only chew his name;	999
	And in my heart the strong and swelling evil	999
	Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied	999
	Is like a good thing, being often read,	999
	Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,	999
	Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,	999
	Could I with boot change for an idle plume,	999
	Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,	999
	How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,	999
	Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls	999
	To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:	999
	Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:	999
	'Tis not the devil's crest.	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
		      How now! who's there?	999
	999
Servant	One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.	999
	999
ANGELO	Teach her the way.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant]	999
	999
	O heavens!	999
	Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,	999
	Making both it unable for itself,	999
	And dispossessing all my other parts	999
	Of necessary fitness?	999
	So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;	999
	Come all to help him, and so stop the air	999
	By which he should revive: and even so	999
	The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,	999
	Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness	999
	Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love	999
	Must needs appear offence.	999
	999
	[Enter ISABELLA]	999
	999
		     How now, fair maid?	999
	999
ISABELLA	I am come to know your pleasure.	999
	999
ANGELO	That you might know it, would much better please me	999
	Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Even so. Heaven keep your honour!	999
	999
ANGELO	Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,	999
	As long as you or I	yet he must die.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Under your sentence?	999
	999
ANGELO	Yea.	999
	999
ISABELLA	When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,	999
	Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted	999
	That his soul sicken not.	999
	999
ANGELO	Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good	999
	To pardon him that hath from nature stolen	999
	A man already made, as to remit	999
	Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image	999
	In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy	999
	Falsely to take away a life true made	999
	As to put metal in restrained means	999
	To make a false one.	999
	999
ISABELLA	'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.	999
	999
ANGELO	Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.	999
	Which had you rather, that the most just law	999
	Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,	999
	Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness	999
	As she that he hath stain'd?	999
	999
ISABELLA	Sir, believe this,	999
	I had rather give my body than my soul.	999
	999
ANGELO	I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins	999
	Stand more for number than for accompt.	999
	999
ISABELLA	How say you?	999
	999
ANGELO	Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak	999
	Against the thing I say. Answer to this:	999
	I, now the voice of the recorded law,	999
	Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:	999
	Might there not be a charity in sin	999
	To save this brother's life?	999
	999
ISABELLA	Please you to do't,	999
	I'll take it as a peril to my soul,	999
	It is no sin at all, but charity.	999
	999
ANGELO	Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,	999
	Were equal poise of sin and charity.	999
	999
ISABELLA	That I do beg his life, if it be sin,	999
	Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,	999
	If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer	999
	To have it added to the faults of mine,	999
	And nothing of your answer.	999
	999
ANGELO	Nay, but hear me.	999
	Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,	999
	Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,	999
	But graciously to know I am no better.	999
	999
ANGELO	Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright	999
	When it doth tax itself; as these black masks	999
	Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder	999
	Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;	999
	To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:	999
	Your brother is to die.	999
	999
ISABELLA	So.	999
	999
ANGELO	And his offence is so, as it appears,	999
	Accountant to the law upon that pain.	999
	999
ISABELLA	True.	999
	999
ANGELO	Admit no other way to save his life,--	999
	As I subscribe not that, nor any other,	999
	But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,	999
	Finding yourself desired of such a person,	999
	Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,	999
	Could fetch your brother from the manacles	999
	Of the all-building law; and that there were	999
	No earthly mean to save him, but that either	999
	You must lay down the treasures of your body	999
	To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;	999
	What would you do?	999
	999
ISABELLA	As much for my poor brother as myself:	999
	That is, were I under the terms of death,	999
	The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,	999
	And strip myself to death, as to a bed	999
	That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield	999
	My body up to shame.	999
	999
ANGELO	Then must your brother die.	999
	999
ISABELLA	And 'twere the cheaper way:	999
	Better it were a brother died at once,	999
	Than that a sister, by redeeming him,	999
	Should die for ever.	999
	999
ANGELO	Were not you then as cruel as the sentence	999
	That you have slander'd so?	999
	999
ISABELLA	Ignomy in ransom and free pardon	999
	Are of two houses: lawful mercy	999
	Is nothing kin to foul redemption.	999
	999
ANGELO	You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;	999
	And rather proved the sliding of your brother	999
	A merriment than a vice.	999
	999
ISABELLA	O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,	999
	To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:	999
	I something do excuse the thing I hate,	999
	For his advantage that I dearly love.	999
	999
ANGELO	We are all frail.	999
	999
ISABELLA	                  Else let my brother die,	999
	If not a feodary, but only he	999
	Owe and succeed thy weakness.	999
	999
ANGELO	Nay, women are frail too.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;	999
	Which are as easy broke as they make forms.	999
	Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar	999
	In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;	999
	For we are soft as our complexions are,	999
	And credulous to false prints.	999
	999
ANGELO	I think it well:	999
	And from this testimony of your own sex,--	999
	Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger	999
	Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;	999
	I do arrest your words. Be that you are,	999
	That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;	999
	If you be one, as you are well express'd	999
	By all external warrants, show it now,	999
	By putting on the destined livery.	999
	999
ISABELLA	I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,	999
	Let me entreat you speak the former language.	999
	999
ANGELO	Plainly conceive, I love you.	999
	999
ISABELLA	My brother did love Juliet,	999
	And you tell me that he shall die for it.	999
	999
ANGELO	He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.	999
	999
ISABELLA	I know your virtue hath a licence in't,	999
	Which seems a little fouler than it is,	999
	To pluck on others.	999
	999
ANGELO	Believe me, on mine honour,	999
	My words express my purpose.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Ha! little honour to be much believed,	999
	And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!	999
	I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:	999
	Sign me a present pardon for my brother,	999
	Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud	999
	What man thou art.	999
	999
ANGELO	                  Who will believe thee, Isabel?	999
	My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,	999
	My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,	999
	Will so your accusation overweigh,	999
	That you shall stifle in your own report	999
	And smell of calumny. I have begun,	999
	And now I give my sensual race the rein:	999
	Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;	999
	Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,	999
	That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother	999
	By yielding up thy body to my will;	999
	Or else he must not only die the death,	999
	But thy unkindness shall his death draw out	999
	To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,	999
	Or, by the affection that now guides me most,	999
	I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,	999
	Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ISABELLA	To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,	999
	Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,	999
	That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,	999
	Either of condemnation or approof;	999
	Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:	999
	Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,	999
	To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:	999
	Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,	999
	Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.	999
	That, had he twenty heads to tender down	999
	On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,	999
	Before his sister should her body stoop	999
	To such abhorr'd pollution.	999
	Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:	999
	More than our brother is our chastity.	999
	I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,	999
	And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A room in the prison.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, CLAUDIO,	999
	and Provost]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	The miserable have no other medicine	999
	But only hope:	999
	I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Be absolute for death; either death or life	999
	Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:	999
	If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing	999
	That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,	999
	Servile to all the skyey influences,	999
	That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,	999
	Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;	999
	For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun	999
	And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;	999
	For all the accommodations that thou bear'st	999
	Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;	999
	For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork	999
	Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,	999
	And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st	999
	Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;	999
	For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains	999
	That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;	999
	For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,	999
	And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;	999
	For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,	999
	After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;	999
	For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,	999
	Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,	999
	And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;	999
	For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,	999
	The mere effusion of thy proper loins,	999
	Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,	999
	For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,	999
	But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,	999
	Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth	999
	Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms	999
	Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,	999
	Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,	999
	To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this	999
	That bears the name of life? Yet in this life	999
	Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,	999
	That makes these odds all even.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I humbly thank you.	999
	To sue to live, I find I seek to die;	999
	And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.	999
	999
ISABELLA	[Within]  What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!	999
	999
Provost	Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Most holy sir, I thank you.	999
	999
	[Enter ISABELLA]	999
	999
ISABELLA	My business is a word or two with Claudio.	999
	999
Provost	And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Provost, a word with you.	999
	999
Provost	As many as you please.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost]	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Now, sister, what's the comfort?	999
	999
ISABELLA	Why,	999
	As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.	999
	Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,	999
	Intends you for his swift ambassador,	999
	Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:	999
	Therefore your best appointment make with speed;	999
	To-morrow you set on.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Is there no remedy?	999
	999
ISABELLA	None, but such remedy as, to save a head,	999
	To cleave a heart in twain.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	But is there any?	999
	999
ISABELLA	Yes, brother, you may live:	999
	There is a devilish mercy in the judge,	999
	If you'll implore it, that will free your life,	999
	But fetter you till death.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Perpetual durance?	999
	999
ISABELLA	Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,	999
	Though all the world's vastidity you had,	999
	To a determined scope.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	But in what nature?	999
	999
ISABELLA	In such a one as, you consenting to't,	999
	Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,	999
	And leave you naked.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Let me know the point.	999
	999
ISABELLA	O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,	999
	Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,	999
	And six or seven winters more respect	999
	Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?	999
	The sense of death is most in apprehension;	999
	And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,	999
	In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great	999
	As when a giant dies.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Why give you me this shame?	999
	Think you I can a resolution fetch	999
	From flowery tenderness? If I must die,	999
	I will encounter darkness as a bride,	999
	And hug it in mine arms.	999
	999
ISABELLA	There spake my brother; there my father's grave	999
	Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:	999
	Thou art too noble to conserve a life	999
	In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,	999
	Whose settled visage and deliberate word	999
	Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew	999
	As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil	999
	His filth within being cast, he would appear	999
	A pond as deep as hell.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	The prenzie Angelo!	999
	999
ISABELLA	O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,	999
	The damned'st body to invest and cover	999
	In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?	999
	If I would yield him my virginity,	999
	Thou mightst be freed.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	O heavens! it cannot be.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,	999
	So to offend him still. This night's the time	999
	That I should do what I abhor to name,	999
	Or else thou diest to-morrow.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Thou shalt not do't.	999
	999
ISABELLA	O, were it but my life,	999
	I'ld throw it down for your deliverance	999
	As frankly as a pin.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Thanks, dear Isabel.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Yes. Has he affections in him,	999
	That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,	999
	When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,	999
	Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Which is the least?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	If it were damnable, he being so wise,	999
	Why would he for the momentary trick	999
	Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!	999
	999
ISABELLA	What says my brother?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Death is a fearful thing.	999
	999
ISABELLA	And shamed life a hateful.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;	999
	To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;	999
	This sensible warm motion to become	999
	A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit	999
	To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside	999
	In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;	999
	To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,	999
	And blown with restless violence round about	999
	The pendent world; or to be worse than worst	999
	Of those that lawless and incertain thought	999
	Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!	999
	The weariest and most loathed worldly life	999
	That age, ache, penury and imprisonment	999
	Can lay on nature is a paradise	999
	To what we fear of death.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Alas, alas!	999
	999
CLAUDIO	          Sweet sister, let me live:	999
	What sin you do to save a brother's life,	999
	Nature dispenses with the deed so far	999
	That it becomes a virtue.	999
	999
ISABELLA	O you beast!	999
	O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!	999
	Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?	999
	Is't not a kind of incest, to take life	999
	From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?	999
	Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!	999
	For such a warped slip of wilderness	999
	Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!	999
	Die, perish! Might but my bending down	999
	Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:	999
	I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,	999
	No word to save thee.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Nay, hear me, Isabel.	999
	999
ISABELLA	O, fie, fie, fie!	999
	Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.	999
	Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:	999
	'Tis best thou diest quickly.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	O hear me, Isabella!	999
	999
	[Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.	999
	999
ISABELLA	What is your will?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and	999
	by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I	999
	would require is likewise your own benefit.	999
	999
ISABELLA	I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be	999
	stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.	999
	999
	[Walks apart]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you	999
	and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to	999
	corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her	999
	virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition	999
	of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,	999
	hath made him that gracious denial which he is most	999
	glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I	999
	know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to	999
	death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes	999
	that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to	999
	your knees and make ready.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love	999
	with life that I will sue to be rid of it.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Hold you there: farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit CLAUDIO]	999
	999
	Provost, a word with you!	999
	999
	[Re-enter Provost]	999
	999
Provost	What's your will, father	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me	999
	awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my	999
	habit no loss shall touch her by my company.	999
	999
Provost	In good time.	999
	999
	[Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:	999
	the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty	999
	brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of	999
	your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever	999
	fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,	999
	fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but	999
	that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should	999
	wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this	999
	substitute, and to save your brother?	999
	999
ISABELLA	I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my	999
	brother die by the law than my son should be	999
	unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke	999
	deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can	999
	speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or	999
	discover his government.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter	999
	now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made	999
	trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my	999
	advisings: to the love I have in doing good a	999
	remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe	999
	that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged	999
	lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from	999
	the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious	999
	person; and much please the absent duke, if	999
	peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of	999
	this business.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do	999
	anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have	999
	you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of	999
	Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?	999
	999
ISABELLA	I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	She should this Angelo have married; was affianced	999
	to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between	999
	which time of the contract and limit of the	999
	solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,	999
	having in that perished vessel the dowry of his	999
	sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the	999
	poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and	999
	renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most	999
	kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of	999
	her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her	999
	combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them	999
	with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,	999
	pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,	999
	bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet	999
	wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,	999
	is washed with them, but relents not.	999
	999
ISABELLA	What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid	999
	from the world! What corruption in this life, that	999
	it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the	999
	cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps	999
	you from dishonour in doing it.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Show me how, good father.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance	999
	of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that	999
	in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,	999
	like an impediment in the current, made it more	999
	violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his	999
	requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with	999
	his demands to the point; only refer yourself to	999
	this advantage, first, that your stay with him may	999
	not be long; that the time may have all shadow and	999
	silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.	999
	This being granted in course,--and now follows	999
	all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up	999
	your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter	999
	acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to	999
	her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother	999
	saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana	999
	advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid	999
	will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you	999
	think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness	999
	of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.	999
	What think you of it?	999
	999
ISABELLA	The image of it gives me content already; and I	999
	trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily	999
	to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his	999
	bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will	999
	presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated	999
	grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that	999
	place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that	999
	it may be quickly.	999
	999
ISABELLA	I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	The street before the prison.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as	999
	before; on the other, ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEY]	999
	999
ELBOW	Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will	999
	needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we	999
	shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	O heavens! what stuff is here	999
	999
POMPEY	'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the	999
	merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by	999
	order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and	999
	furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that	999
	craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.	999
	999
ELBOW	Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	And you, good brother father. What offence hath	999
	this man made you, sir?	999
	999
ELBOW	Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we	999
	take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found	999
	upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have	999
	sent to the deputy.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!	999
	The evil that thou causest to be done,	999
	That is thy means to live. Do thou but think	999
	What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back	999
	From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,	999
	From their abominable and beastly touches	999
	I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.	999
	Canst thou believe thy living is a life,	999
	So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.	999
	999
POMPEY	Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,	999
	sir, I would prove--	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,	999
	Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:	999
	Correction and instruction must both work	999
	Ere this rude beast will profit.	999
	999
ELBOW	He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him	999
	warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if	999
	he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were	999
	as good go a mile on his errand.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	That we were all, as some would seem to be,	999
	From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!	999
	999
ELBOW	His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.	999
	999
POMPEY	I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a	999
	friend of mine.	999
	999
	[Enter LUCIO]	999
	999
LUCIO	How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of	999
	Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there	999
	none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be	999
	had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and	999
	extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What	999
	sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't	999
	not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest	999
	thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is	999
	the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The	999
	trick of it?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Still thus, and thus; still worse!	999
	999
LUCIO	How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she	999
	still, ha?	999
	999
POMPEY	Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she	999
	is herself in the tub.	999
	999
LUCIO	Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be	999
	so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:	999
	an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going	999
	to prison, Pompey?	999
	999
POMPEY	Yes, faith, sir.	999
	999
LUCIO	Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I	999
	sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?	999
	999
ELBOW	For being a bawd, for being a bawd.	999
	999
LUCIO	Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the	999
	due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he	999
	doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.	999
	Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,	999
	Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you	999
	will keep the house.	999
	999
POMPEY	I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.	999
	999
LUCIO	No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.	999
	I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If	999
	you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the	999
	more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	And you.	999
	999
LUCIO	Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?	999
	999
ELBOW	Come your ways, sir; come.	999
	999
POMPEY	You will not bail me, then, sir?	999
	999
LUCIO	Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?	999
	what news?	999
	999
ELBOW	Come your ways, sir; come.	999
	999
LUCIO	Go to kennel, Pompey; go.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers]	999
	999
	What news, friar, of the duke?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	I know none. Can you tell me of any?	999
	999
LUCIO	Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other	999
	some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.	999
	999
LUCIO	It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from	999
	the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born	999
	to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he	999
	puts transgression to 't.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	He does well in 't.	999
	999
LUCIO	A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in	999
	him: something too crabbed that way, friar.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.	999
	999
LUCIO	Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;	999
	it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp	999
	it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put	999
	down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and	999
	woman after this downright way of creation: is it	999
	true, think you?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	How should he be made, then?	999
	999
LUCIO	Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he	999
	was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is	999
	certain that when he makes water his urine is	999
	congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a	999
	motion generative; that's infallible.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.	999
	999
LUCIO	Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the	999
	rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a	999
	man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?	999
	Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a	999
	hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing	999
	a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he	999
	knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	I never heard the absent duke much detected for	999
	women; he was not inclined that way.	999
	999
LUCIO	O, sir, you are deceived.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	'Tis not possible.	999
	999
LUCIO	Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and	999
	his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the	999
	duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;	999
	that let me inform you.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	You do him wrong, surely.	999
	999
LUCIO	Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the	999
	duke: and I believe I know the cause of his	999
	withdrawing.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	What, I prithee, might be the cause?	999
	999
LUCIO	No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the	999
	teeth and the lips: but this I can let you	999
	understand, the greater file of the subject held the	999
	duke to be wise.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Wise! why, no question but he was.	999
	999
LUCIO	A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:	999
	the very stream of his life and the business he hath	999
	helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better	999
	proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own	999
	bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the	999
	envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.	999
	Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your	999
	knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.	999
	999
LUCIO	Sir, I know him, and I love him.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with	999
	dearer love.	999
	999
LUCIO	Come, sir, I know what I know.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	I can hardly believe that, since you know not what	999
	you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our	999
	prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your	999
	answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,	999
	you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call	999
	upon you; and, I pray you, your name?	999
	999
LUCIO	Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to	999
	report you.	999
	999
LUCIO	I fear you not.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you	999
	imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I	999
	can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.	999
	999
LUCIO	I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,	999
	friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if	999
	Claudio die to-morrow or no?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Why should he die, sir?	999
	999
LUCIO	Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would	999
	the duke we talk of were returned again: the	999
	ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with	999
	continency; sparrows must not build in his	999
	house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke	999
	yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would	999
	never bring them to light: would he were returned!	999
	Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.	999
	Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The	999
	duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on	999
	Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,	999
	he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown	999
	bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	No might nor greatness in mortality	999
	Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny	999
	The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong	999
	Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?	999
	But who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE]	999
	999
ESCALUS	Go; away with her to prison!	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted	999
	a merciful man; good my lord.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in	999
	the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play	999
	the tyrant.	999
	999
Provost	A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please	999
	your honour.	999
	999
MISTRESS OVERDONE	My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.	999
	Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the	999
	duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child	999
	is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:	999
	I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!	999
	999
ESCALUS	That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be	999
	called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;	999
	no more words.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE]	999
	999
	Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;	999
	Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished	999
	with divines, and have all charitable preparation.	999
	if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be	999
	so with him.	999
	999
Provost	So please you, this friar hath been with him, and	999
	advised him for the entertainment of death.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Good even, good father.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Bliss and goodness on you!	999
	999
ESCALUS	Of whence are you?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Not of this country, though my chance is now	999
	To use it for my time: I am a brother	999
	Of gracious order, late come from the See	999
	In special business from his holiness.	999
	999
ESCALUS	What news abroad i' the world?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	None, but that there is so great a fever on	999
	goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:	999
	novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous	999
	to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous	999
	to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce	999
	truth enough alive to make societies secure; but	999
	security enough to make fellowships accurst: much	999
	upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This	999
	news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I	999
	pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?	999
	999
ESCALUS	One that, above all other strifes, contended	999
	especially to know himself.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	What pleasure was he given to?	999
	999
ESCALUS	Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at	999
	any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a	999
	gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to	999
	his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;	999
	and let me desire to know how you find Claudio	999
	prepared. I am made to understand that you have	999
	lent him visitation.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	He professes to have received no sinister measure	999
	from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself	999
	to the determination of justice: yet had he framed	999
	to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many	999
	deceiving promises of life; which I by my good	999
	leisure have discredited to him, and now is he	999
	resolved to die.	999
	999
ESCALUS	You have paid the heavens your function, and the	999
	prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have	999
	laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest	999
	shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I	999
	found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him	999
	he is indeed Justice.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	If his own life answer the straitness of his	999
	proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he	999
	chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.	999
	999
ESCALUS	I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Peace be with you!	999
	999
	[Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost]	999
	999
	He who the sword of heaven will bear	999
	Should be as holy as severe;	999
	Pattern in himself to know,	999
	Grace to stand, and virtue go;	999
	More nor less to others paying	999
	Than by self-offences weighing.	999
	Shame to him whose cruel striking	999
	Kills for faults of his own liking!	999
	Twice treble shame on Angelo,	999
	To weed my vice and let his grow!	999
	O, what may man within him hide,	999
	Though angel on the outward side!	999
	How may likeness made in crimes,	999
	Making practise on the times,	999
	To draw with idle spiders' strings	999
	Most ponderous and substantial things!	999
	Craft against vice I must apply:	999
	With Angelo to-night shall lie	999
	His old betrothed but despised;	999
	So disguise shall, by the disguised,	999
	Pay with falsehood false exacting,	999
	And perform an old contracting.	999

	999
	[Boy sings]	999
	999
	Take, O, take those lips away,	999
	That so sweetly were forsworn;	999
	And those eyes, the break of day,	999
	Lights that do mislead the morn:	999
	But my kisses bring again, bring again;	999
	Seals of love, but sealed in vain, sealed in vain.	999
	999
MARIANA	Break off thy song, and haste thee quick away:	999
	Here comes a man of comfort, whose advice	999
	Hath often still'd my brawling discontent.	999
	999
	[Exit Boy]	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before]	999
	999
	I cry you mercy, sir; and well could wish	999
	You had not found me here so musical:	999
	Let me excuse me, and believe me so,	999
	My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm	999
	To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.	999
	I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired	999
	for me here to-day? much upon this time have	999
	I promised here to meet.	999
	999
MARIANA	You have not been inquired after:	999
	I have sat here all day.	999
	999
	[Enter ISABELLA]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	I do constantly believe you. The time is come even	999
	now. I shall crave your forbearance a little: may	999
	be I will call upon you anon, for some advantage to yourself.	999
	999
MARIANA	I am always bound to you.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Very well met, and well come.	999
	What is the news from this good deputy?	999
	999
ISABELLA	He hath a garden circummured with brick,	999
	Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;	999
	And to that vineyard is a planched gate,	999
	That makes his opening with this bigger key:	999
	This other doth command a little door	999
	Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;	999
	There have I made my promise	999
	Upon the heavy middle of the night	999
	To call upon him.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	But shall you on your knowledge find this way?	999
	999
ISABELLA	I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:	999
	With whispering and most guilty diligence,	999
	In action all of precept, he did show me	999
	The way twice o'er.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Are there no other tokens	999
	Between you 'greed concerning her observance?	999
	999
ISABELLA	No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;	999
	And that I have possess'd him my most stay	999
	Can be but brief; for I have made him know	999
	I have a servant comes with me along,	999
	That stays upon me, whose persuasion is	999
	I come about my brother.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	'Tis well borne up.	999
	I have not yet made known to Mariana	999
	A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!	999
	999
	[Re-enter MARIANA]	999
	999
	I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;	999
	She comes to do you good.	999
	999
ISABELLA	I do desire the like.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?	999
	999
MARIANA	Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Take, then, this your companion by the hand,	999
	Who hath a story ready for your ear.	999
	I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;	999
	The vaporous night approaches.	999
	999
MARIANA	Will't please you walk aside?	999
	999
	[Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	O place and greatness! millions of false eyes	999
	Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report	999
	Run with these false and most contrarious quests	999
	Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit	999
	Make thee the father of their idle dreams	999
	And rack thee in their fancies.	999
	999
	[Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA]	999
	999
		          Welcome, how agreed?	999
	999
ISABELLA	She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,	999
	If you advise it.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	                  It is not my consent,	999
	But my entreaty too.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Little have you to say	999
	When you depart from him, but, soft and low,	999
	'Remember now my brother.'	999
	999
MARIANA	Fear me not.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.	999
	He is your husband on a pre-contract:	999
	To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,	999
	Sith that the justice of your title to him	999
	Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:	999
	Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.	999

SCENE II	A room in the prison.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Provost and POMPEY]	999
	999
Provost	Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?	999
	999
POMPEY	If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a	999
	married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never	999
	cut off a woman's head.	999
	999
Provost	Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a	999
	direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio	999
	and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common	999
	executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if	999
	you will take it on you to assist him, it shall	999
	redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have	999
	your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance	999
	with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a	999
	notorious bawd.	999
	999
POMPEY	Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;	999
	but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I	999
	would be glad to receive some instruction from my	999
	fellow partner.	999
	999
Provost	What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?	999
	999
	[Enter ABHORSON]	999
	999
ABHORSON	Do you call, sir?	999
	999
Provost	Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in	999
	your execution. If you think it meet, compound with	999
	him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if	999
	not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He	999
	cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.	999
	999
ABHORSON	A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.	999
	999
Provost	Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn	999
	the scale.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
POMPEY	Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a	999
	good favour you have, but that you have a hanging	999
	look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?	999
	999
ABHORSON	Ay, sir; a mystery	999
	999
POMPEY	Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and	999
	your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,	999
	using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:	999
	but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I	999
	should be hanged, I cannot imagine.	999
	999
ABHORSON	Sir, it is a mystery.	999
	999
POMPEY	Proof?	999
	999
ABHORSON	Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be	999
	too little for your thief, your true man thinks it	999
	big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your	999
	thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's	999
	apparel fits your thief.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Provost]	999
	999
Provost	Are you agreed?	999
	999
POMPEY	Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is	999
	a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth	999
	oftener ask forgiveness.	999
	999
Provost	You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe	999
	to-morrow four o'clock.	999
	999
ABHORSON	Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.	999
	999
POMPEY	I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have	999
	occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find	999
	me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you	999
	a good turn.	999
	999
Provost	Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:	999
	999
	[Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON]	999
	999
	The one has my pity; not a jot the other,	999
	Being a murderer, though he were my brother.	999
	999
	[Enter CLAUDIO]	999
	999
	Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:	999
	'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow	999
	Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour	999
	When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:	999
	He will not wake.	999
	999
Provost	                  Who can do good on him?	999
	Well, go, prepare yourself.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	999
		      But, hark, what noise?	999
	Heaven give your spirits comfort!	999
	999
	[Exit CLAUDIO]	999
	999
		                  By and by.	999
	I hope it is some pardon or reprieve	999
	For the most gentle Claudio.	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before]	999
	999
		       Welcome father.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	The best and wholesomest spirts of the night	999
	Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?	999
	999
Provost	None, since the curfew rung.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Not Isabel?	999
	999
Provost	          No.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	                  They will, then, ere't be long.	999
	999
Provost	What comfort is for Claudio?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	There's some in hope.	999
	999
Provost	It is a bitter deputy.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd	999
	Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:	999
	He doth with holy abstinence subdue	999
	That in himself which he spurs on his power	999
	To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that	999
	Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;	999
	But this being so, he's just.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	999
		        Now are they come.	999
	999
	[Exit Provost]	999
	999
	This is a gentle provost: seldom when	999
	The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	999
	How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste	999
	That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Provost]	999
	999
Provost	There he must stay until the officer	999
	Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,	999
	But he must die to-morrow?	999
	999
Provost	None, sir, none.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	As near the dawning, provost, as it is,	999
	You shall hear more ere morning.	999
	999
Provost	Happily	999
	You something know; yet I believe there comes	999
	No countermand; no such example have we:	999
	Besides, upon the very siege of justice	999
	Lord Angelo hath to the public ear	999
	Profess'd the contrary.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
		  This is his lordship's man.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	And here comes Claudio's pardon.	999
	999
Messenger	[Giving a paper]	999
	999
	My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this	999
	further charge, that you swerve not from the	999
	smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or	999
	other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,	999
	it is almost day.	999
	999
Provost	I shall obey him.	999
	999
	[Exit Messenger]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	[Aside]  This is his pardon, purchased by such sin	999
	For which the pardoner himself is in.	999
	Hence hath offence his quick celerity,	999
	When it is born in high authority:	999
	When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,	999
	That for the fault's love is the offender friended.	999
	Now, sir, what news?	999
	999
Provost	I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss	999
	in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted	999
	putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Pray you, let's hear.	999
	999
Provost	[Reads]	999
	999
	'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let	999
	Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the	999
	afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,	999
	let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let	999
	this be duly performed; with a thought that more	999
	depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail	999
	not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'	999
	What say you to this, sir?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the	999
	afternoon?	999
	999
Provost	A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one	999
	that is a prisoner nine years old.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	How came it that the absent duke had not either	999
	delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I	999
	have heard it was ever his manner to do so.	999
	999
Provost	His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,	999
	indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord	999
	Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	It is now apparent?	999
	999
Provost	Most manifest, and not denied by himself.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how	999
	seems he to be touched?	999
	999
Provost	A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but	999
	as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless	999
	of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of	999
	mortality, and desperately mortal.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	He wants advice.	999
	999
Provost	He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty	999
	of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he	999
	would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days	999
	entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if	999
	to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming	999
	warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	More of him anon. There is written in your brow,	999
	provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not	999
	truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the	999
	boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.	999
	Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is	999
	no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath	999
	sentenced him. To make you understand this in a	999
	manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;	999
	for the which you are to do me both a present and a	999
	dangerous courtesy.	999
	999
Provost	Pray, sir, in what?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	In the delaying death.	999
	999
Provost	A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,	999
	and an express command, under penalty, to deliver	999
	his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case	999
	as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my	999
	instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine	999
	be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.	999
	999
Provost	Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.	999
	Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was	999
	the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his	999
	death: you know the course is common. If any thing	999
	fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good	999
	fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead	999
	against it with my life.	999
	999
Provost	Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?	999
	999
Provost	To him, and to his substitutes.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	You will think you have made no offence, if the duke	999
	avouch the justice of your dealing?	999
	999
Provost	But what likelihood is in that?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see	999
	you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor	999
	persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go	999
	further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.	999
	Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the	999
	duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the	999
	signet is not strange to you.	999
	999
Provost	I know them both.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	The contents of this is the return of the duke: you	999
	shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you	999
	shall find, within these two days he will be here.	999
	This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this	999
	very day receives letters of strange tenor;	999
	perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering	999
	into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what	999
	is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the	999
	shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these	999
	things should be: all difficulties are but easy	999
	when they are known. Call your executioner, and off	999
	with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present	999
	shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you	999
	are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.	999
	Come away; it is almost clear dawn.	999

	999
	[Enter POMPEY]	999
	999
POMPEY	I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house	999
	of profession: one would think it were Mistress	999
	Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old	999
	customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in	999
	for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,	999
	ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made	999
	five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not	999
	much in request, for the old women were all dead.	999
	Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of	999
	Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of	999
	peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a	999
	beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young	999
	Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master	999
	Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young	999
	Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master	999
	Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the	999
	great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed	999
	Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in	999
	our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'	999
	999
	[Enter ABHORSON]	999
	999
ABHORSON	Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.	999
	999
POMPEY	Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.	999
	Master Barnardine!	999
	999
ABHORSON	What, ho, Barnardine!	999
	999
BARNARDINE	[Within]  A pox o' your throats! Who makes that	999
	noise there? What are you?	999
	999
POMPEY	Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so	999
	good, sir, to rise and be put to death.	999
	999
BARNARDINE	[Within]  Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.	999
	999
ABHORSON	Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.	999
	999
POMPEY	Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are	999
	executed, and sleep afterwards.	999
	999
ABHORSON	Go in to him, and fetch him out.	999
	999
POMPEY	He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.	999
	999
ABHORSON	Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?	999
	999
POMPEY	Very ready, sir.	999
	999
	[Enter BARNARDINE]	999
	999
BARNARDINE	How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?	999
	999
ABHORSON	Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your	999
	prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.	999
	999
BARNARDINE	You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not	999
	fitted for 't.	999
	999
POMPEY	O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,	999
	and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the	999
	sounder all the next day.	999
	999
ABHORSON	Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do	999
	we jest now, think you?	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily	999
	you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort	999
	you and pray with you.	999
	999
BARNARDINE	Friar, not I	I have been drinking hard all night,	999
	and I will have more time to prepare me, or they	999
	shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not	999
	consent to die this day, that's certain.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you	999
	Look forward on the journey you shall go.	999
	999
BARNARDINE	I swear I will not die to-day for any man's	999
	persuasion.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	But hear you.	999
	999
BARNARDINE	Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,	999
	come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!	999
	After him, fellows; bring him to the block.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY]	999
	999
	[Re-enter Provost]	999
	999
Provost	Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;	999
	And to transport him in the mind he is	999
	Were damnable.	999
	999
Provost	                  Here in the prison, father,	999
	There died this morning of a cruel fever	999
	One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,	999
	A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head	999
	Just of his colour. What if we do omit	999
	This reprobate till he were well inclined;	999
	And satisfy the deputy with the visage	999
	Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!	999
	Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on	999
	Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,	999
	And sent according to command; whiles I	999
	Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.	999
	999
Provost	This shall be done, good father, presently.	999
	But Barnardine must die this afternoon:	999
	And how shall we continue Claudio,	999
	To save me from the danger that might come	999
	If he were known alive?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Let this be done.	999
	Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:	999
	Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting	999
	To the under generation, you shall find	999
	Your safety manifested.	999
	999
Provost	I am your free dependant.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.	999
	999
	[Exit Provost]	999
	999
	Now will I write letters to Angelo,--	999
	The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents	999
	Shall witness to him I am near at home,	999
	And that, by great injunctions, I am bound	999
	To enter publicly: him I'll desire	999
	To meet me at the consecrated fount	999
	A league below the city; and from thence,	999
	By cold gradation and well-balanced form,	999
	We shall proceed with Angelo.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Provost]	999
	999
Provost	Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Convenient is it. Make a swift return;	999
	For I would commune with you of such things	999
	That want no ear but yours.	999
	999
Provost	I'll make all speed.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999

ISABELLA	[Within]  Peace, ho, be here!	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know	999
	If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:	999
	But I will keep her ignorant of her good,	999
	To make her heavenly comforts of despair,	999
	When it is least expected.	999
	999
	[Enter ISABELLA]	999
	999
ISABELLA	Ho, by your leave!	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.	999
	999
ISABELLA	The better, given me by so holy a man.	999
	Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:	999
	His head is off and sent to Angelo.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Nay, but it is not so.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,	999
	In your close patience.	999
	999
ISABELLA	O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	You shall not be admitted to his sight.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!	999
	Injurious world! most damned Angelo!	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;	999
	Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.	999
	Mark what I say, which you shall find	999
	By every syllable a faithful verity:	999
	The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;	999
	One of our convent, and his confessor,	999
	Gives me this instance: already he hath carried	999
	Notice to Escalus and Angelo,	999
	Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,	999
	There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom	999
	In that good path that I would wish it go,	999
	And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,	999
	Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,	999
	And general honour.	999
	999
ISABELLA	                  I am directed by you.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;	999
	'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:	999
	Say, by this token, I desire his company	999
	At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours	999
	I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you	999
	Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo	999
	Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,	999
	I am combined by a sacred vow	999
	And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:	999
	Command these fretting waters from your eyes	999
	With a light heart; trust not my holy order,	999
	If I pervert your course. Who's here?	999
	999
	[Enter LUCIO]	999
	999
LUCIO	Good even. Friar, where's the provost?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Not within, sir.	999
	999
LUCIO	O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see	999
	thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain	999
	to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for	999
	my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set	999
	me to 't. But they say the duke will be here	999
	to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:	999
	if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been	999
	at home, he had lived.	999
	999
	[Exit ISABELLA]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your	999
	reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.	999
	999
LUCIO	Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:	999
	he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.	999
	999
LUCIO	Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee	999
	I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	You have told me too many of him already, sir, if	999
	they be true; if not true, none were enough.	999
	999
LUCIO	I was once before him for getting a wench with child.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Did you such a thing?	999
	999
LUCIO	Yes, marry, did I	but I was fain to forswear it;	999
	they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.	999
	999
LUCIO	By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:	999
	if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of	999
	it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS]	999
	999
ESCALUS	Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.	999
	999
ANGELO	In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions	999
	show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be	999
	not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and	999
	redeliver our authorities there	999
	999
ESCALUS	I guess not.	999
	999
ANGELO	And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his	999
	entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,	999
	they should exhibit their petitions in the street?	999
	999
ESCALUS	He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of	999
	complaints, and to deliver us from devices	999
	hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand	999
	against us.	999
	999
ANGELO	Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes	999
	i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give	999
	notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet	999
	him.	999
	999
ESCALUS	I shall, sir. Fare you well.	999
	999
ANGELO	Good night.	999
	999
	[Exit ESCALUS]	999
	999
	This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant	999
	And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!	999
	And by an eminent body that enforced	999
	The law against it! But that her tender shame	999
	Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,	999
	How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;	999
	For my authority bears of a credent bulk,	999
	That no particular scandal once can touch	999
	But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,	999
	Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,	999
	Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,	999
	By so receiving a dishonour'd life	999
	With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!	999
	A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,	999
	Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.	999

	He says, to veil full purpose.	999

MARIANA	Be ruled by him.	999

ISABELLA	Besides, he tells me that, if peradventure	999
	He speak against me on the adverse side,	999
	I should not think it strange; for 'tis a physic	999
	That's bitter to sweet end.	999

	Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.	999

ANGELO	|	999
	|  Happy return be to your royal grace!	999
ESCALUS	|	999
	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Many and hearty thankings to you both.	999
	We have made inquiry of you; and we hear	999
	Such goodness of your justice, that our soul	999
	Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,	999
	Forerunning more requital.	999
	999
ANGELO	You make my bonds still greater.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,	999
	To lock it in the wards of covert bosom,	999
	When it deserves, with characters of brass,	999
	A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time	999
	And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,	999
	And let the subject see, to make them know	999
	That outward courtesies would fain proclaim	999
	Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,	999
	You must walk by us on our other hand;	999
	And good supporters are you.	999
	999
	[FRIAR PETER and ISABELLA come forward]	999
	999
FRIAR PETER	Now is your time: speak loud and kneel before him.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard	999
	Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!	999
	O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye	999
	By throwing it on any other object	999
	Till you have heard me in my true complaint	999
	And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.	999
	Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:	999
	Reveal yourself to him.	999
	999
ISABELLA	O worthy duke,	999
	You bid me seek redemption of the devil:	999
	Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak	999
	Must either punish me, not being believed,	999
	Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!	999
	999
ANGELO	My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:	999
	She hath been a suitor to me for her brother	999
	Cut off by course of justice,--	999
	999
ISABELLA	By course of justice!	999
	999
ANGELO	And she will speak most bitterly and strange.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:	999
	That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?	999
	That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?	999
	That Angelo is an adulterous thief,	999
	An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;	999
	Is it not strange and strange?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Nay, it is ten times strange.	999
	999
ISABELLA	It is not truer he is Angelo	999
	Than this is all as true as it is strange:	999
	Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth	999
	To the end of reckoning.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Away with her! Poor soul,	999
	She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.	999
	999
ISABELLA	O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest	999
	There is another comfort than this world,	999
	That thou neglect me not, with that opinion	999
	That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible	999
	That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible	999
	But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,	999
	May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute	999
	As Angelo; even so may Angelo,	999
	In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,	999
	Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:	999
	If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,	999
	Had I more name for badness.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	By mine honesty,	999
	If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--	999
	Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,	999
	Such a dependency of thing on thing,	999
	As e'er I heard in madness.	999
	999
ISABELLA	O gracious duke,	999
	Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason	999
	For inequality; but let your reason serve	999
	To make the truth appear where it seems hid,	999
	And hide the false seems true.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Many that are not mad	999
	Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?	999
	999
ISABELLA	I am the sister of one Claudio,	999
	Condemn'd upon the act of fornication	999
	To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:	999
	I, in probation of a sisterhood,	999
	Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio	999
	As then the messenger,--	999
	999
LUCIO	That's I, an't like your grace:	999
	I came to her from Claudio, and desired her	999
	To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo	999
	For her poor brother's pardon.	999
	999
ISABELLA	That's he indeed.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	You were not bid to speak.	999
	999
LUCIO	No, my good lord;	999
	Nor wish'd to hold my peace.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	I wish you now, then;	999
	Pray you, take note of it: and when you have	999
	A business for yourself, pray heaven you then	999
	Be perfect.	999
	999
LUCIO	I warrant your honour.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.	999
	999
ISABELLA	This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--	999
	999
LUCIO	Right.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	It may be right; but you are i' the wrong	999
	To speak before your time. Proceed.	999
	999
ISABELLA	I went	999
	To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	That's somewhat madly spoken.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Pardon it;	999
	The phrase is to the matter.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Mended again. The matter; proceed.	999
	999
ISABELLA	In brief, to set the needless process by,	999
	How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,	999
	How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--	999
	For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion	999
	I now begin with grief and shame to utter:	999
	He would not, but by gift of my chaste body	999
	To his concupiscible intemperate lust,	999
	Release my brother; and, after much debatement,	999
	My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,	999
	And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,	999
	His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant	999
	For my poor brother's head.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	This is most likely!	999
	999
ISABELLA	O, that it were as like as it is true!	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,	999
	Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour	999
	In hateful practise. First, his integrity	999
	Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason	999
	That with such vehemency he should pursue	999
	Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,	999
	He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself	999
	And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:	999
	Confess the truth, and say by whose advice	999
	Thou camest here to complain.	999
	999
ISABELLA	And is this all?	999
	Then, O you blessed ministers above,	999
	Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time	999
	Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up	999
	In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,	999
	As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!	999
	To prison with her! Shall we thus permit	999
	A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall	999
	On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.	999
	Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?	999
	999
ISABELLA	One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?	999
	999
LUCIO	My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;	999
	I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord	999
	For certain words he spake against your grace	999
	In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!	999
	And to set on this wretched woman here	999
	Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.	999
	999
LUCIO	But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,	999
	I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,	999
	A very scurvy fellow.	999
	999
FRIAR PETER	Blessed be your royal grace!	999
	I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard	999
	Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman	999
	Most wrongfully accused your substitute,	999
	Who is as free from touch or soil with her	999
	As she from one ungot.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	We did believe no less.	999
	Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?	999
	999
FRIAR PETER	I know him for a man divine and holy;	999
	Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,	999
	As he's reported by this gentleman;	999
	And, on my trust, a man that never yet	999
	Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.	999
	999
LUCIO	My lord, most villanously; believe it.	999
	999
FRIAR PETER	Well, he in time may come to clear himself;	999
	But at this instant he is sick my lord,	999
	Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,	999
	Being come to knowledge that there was complaint	999
	Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,	999
	To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know	999
	Is true and false; and what he with his oath	999
	And all probation will make up full clear,	999
	Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.	999
	To justify this worthy nobleman,	999
	So vulgarly and personally accused,	999
	Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,	999
	Till she herself confess it.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Good friar, let's hear it.	999
	999
	[ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward]	999
	999
	Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?	999
	O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!	999
	Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;	999
	In this I'll be impartial; be you judge	999
	Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?	999
	First, let her show her face, and after speak.	999
	999
MARIANA	Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face	999
	Until my husband bid me.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	What, are you married?	999
	999
MARIANA	No, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Are you a maid?	999
	999
MARIANA	No, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	A widow, then?	999
	999
MARIANA	Neither, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?	999
	999
LUCIO	My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are	999
	neither maid, widow, nor wife.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause	999
	To prattle for himself.	999
	999
LUCIO	Well, my lord.	999
	999
MARIANA	My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;	999
	And I confess besides I am no maid:	999
	I have known my husband; yet my husband	999
	Knows not that ever he knew me.	999
	999
LUCIO	He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!	999
	999
LUCIO	Well, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	This is no witness for Lord Angelo.	999
	999
MARIANA	Now I come to't my lord	999
	She that accuses him of fornication,	999
	In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,	999
	And charges him my lord, with such a time	999
	When I'll depose I had him in mine arms	999
	With all the effect of love.	999
	999
ANGELO	Charges she more than me?	999
	999
MARIANA	Not that I know.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	No? you say your husband.	999
	999
MARIANA	Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,	999
	Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,	999
	But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.	999
	999
ANGELO	This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.	999
	999
MARIANA	My husband bids me; now I will unmask.	999
	999
	[Unveiling]	999
	999
	This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,	999
	Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;	999
	This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,	999
	Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body	999
	That took away the match from Isabel,	999
	And did supply thee at thy garden-house	999
	In her imagined person.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Know you this woman?	999
	999
LUCIO	Carnally, she says.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Sirrah, no more!	999
	999
LUCIO	Enough, my lord.	999
	999
ANGELO	My lord, I must confess I know this woman:	999
	And five years since there was some speech of marriage	999
	Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,	999
	Partly for that her promised proportions	999
	Came short of composition, but in chief	999
	For that her reputation was disvalued	999
	In levity: since which time of five years	999
	I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,	999
	Upon my faith and honour.	999
	999
MARIANA	Noble prince,	999
	As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,	999
	As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,	999
	I am affianced this man's wife as strongly	999
	As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,	999
	But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house	999
	He knew me as a wife. As this is true,	999
	Let me in safety raise me from my knees	999
	Or else for ever be confixed here,	999
	A marble monument!	999
	999
ANGELO	                  I did but smile till now:	999
	Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice	999
	My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive	999
	These poor informal women are no more	999
	But instruments of some more mightier member	999
	That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,	999
	To find this practise out.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Ay, with my heart	999
	And punish them to your height of pleasure.	999
	Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,	999
	Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,	999
	Though they would swear down each particular saint,	999
	Were testimonies against his worth and credit	999
	That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,	999
	Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains	999
	To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.	999
	There is another friar that set them on;	999
	Let him be sent for.	999
	999
FRIAR PETER	Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed	999
	Hath set the women on to this complaint:	999
	Your provost knows the place where he abides	999
	And he may fetch him.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Go do it instantly.	999
	999
	[Exit Provost]	999
	999
	And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,	999
	Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,	999
	Do with your injuries as seems you best,	999
	In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;	999
	But stir not you till you have well determined	999
	Upon these slanderers.	999
	999
ESCALUS	My lord, we'll do it throughly.	999
	999
	[Exit DUKE]	999
	999
	Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that	999
	Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?	999
	999
LUCIO	'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing	999
	but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most	999
	villanous speeches of the duke.	999
	999
ESCALUS	We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and	999
	enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a	999
	notable fellow.	999
	999
LUCIO	As any in Vienna, on my word.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.	999
	999
	[Exit an Attendant]	999
	999
	Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you	999
	shall see how I'll handle her.	999
	999
LUCIO	Not better than he, by her own report.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Say you?	999
	999
LUCIO	Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,	999
	she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,	999
	she'll be ashamed.	999
	999
ESCALUS	I will go darkly to work with her.	999
	999
LUCIO	That's the way; for women are light at midnight.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with	999
	the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habit]	999
	999
ESCALUS	Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all	999
	that you have said.	999
	999
LUCIO	My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with	999
	the provost.	999
	999
ESCALUS	In very good time: speak not you to him till we	999
	call upon you.	999
	999
LUCIO	Mum.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander	999
	Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	'Tis false.	999
	999
ESCALUS	How! know you where you are?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Respect to your great place! and let the devil	999
	Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!	999
	Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.	999
	999
ESCALUS	The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:	999
	Look you speak justly.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,	999
	Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?	999
	Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?	999
	Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,	999
	Thus to retort your manifest appeal,	999
	And put your trial in the villain's mouth	999
	Which here you come to accuse.	999
	999
LUCIO	This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,	999
	Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women	999
	To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth	999
	And in the witness of his proper ear,	999
	To call him villain? and then to glance from him	999
	To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?	999
	Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you	999
	Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.	999
	What 'unjust'!	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	                  Be not so hot; the duke	999
	Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he	999
	Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,	999
	Nor here provincial. My business in this state	999
	Made me a looker on here in Vienna,	999
	Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble	999
	Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,	999
	But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes	999
	Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,	999
	As much in mock as mark.	999
	999
ESCALUS	Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!	999
	999
ANGELO	What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?	999
	Is this the man that you did tell us of?	999
	999
LUCIO	'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:	999
	do you know me?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I	999
	met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.	999
	999
LUCIO	O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Most notedly, sir.	999
	999
LUCIO	Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a	999
	fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make	999
	that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and	999
	much more, much worse.	999
	999
LUCIO	O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the	999
	nose for thy speeches?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	I protest I love the duke as I love myself.	999
	999
ANGELO	Hark, how the villain would close now, after his	999
	treasonable abuses!	999
	999
ESCALUS	Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with	999
	him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him	999
	to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him	999
	speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and	999
	with the other confederate companion!	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	[To Provost]  Stay, sir; stay awhile.	999
	999
ANGELO	What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.	999
	999
LUCIO	Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you	999
	bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must	999
	you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!	999
	show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!	999
	Will't not off?	999
	999
	[Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers DUKE	999
	VINCENTIO]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.	999
	First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.	999
	999
	[To LUCIO]	999
	999
	Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you	999
	Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.	999
	999
LUCIO	This may prove worse than hanging.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	[To ESCALUS]  What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:	999
	We'll borrow place of him.	999
	999
	[To ANGELO]	999
	999
		     Sir, by your leave.	999
	Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,	999
	That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,	999
	Rely upon it till my tale be heard,	999
	And hold no longer out.	999
	999
ANGELO	O my dread lord,	999
	I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,	999
	To think I can be undiscernible,	999
	When I perceive your grace, like power divine,	999
	Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,	999
	No longer session hold upon my shame,	999
	But let my trial be mine own confession:	999
	Immediate sentence then and sequent death	999
	Is all the grace I beg.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Come hither, Mariana.	999
	Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?	999
	999
ANGELO	I was, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.	999
	Do you the office, friar; which consummate,	999
	Return him here again. Go with him, provost.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER and Provost]	999
	999
ESCALUS	My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour	999
	Than at the strangeness of it.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Come hither, Isabel.	999
	Your friar is now your prince: as I was then	999
	Advertising and holy to your business,	999
	Not changing heart with habit, I am still	999
	Attorney'd at your service.	999
	999
ISABELLA	O, give me pardon,	999
	That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd	999
	Your unknown sovereignty!	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	You are pardon'd, Isabel:	999
	And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.	999
	Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;	999
	And you may marvel why I obscured myself,	999
	Labouring to save his life, and would not rather	999
	Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power	999
	Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,	999
	It was the swift celerity of his death,	999
	Which I did think with slower foot came on,	999
	That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!	999
	That life is better life, past fearing death,	999
	Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,	999
	So happy is your brother.	999
	999
ISABELLA	I do, my lord.	999
	999
	[Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and Provost]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	For this new-married man approaching here,	999
	Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd	999
	Your well defended honour, you must pardon	999
	For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--	999
	Being criminal, in double violation	999
	Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach	999
	Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--	999
	The very mercy of the law cries out	999
	Most audible, even from his proper tongue,	999
	'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'	999
	Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;	999
	Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.	999
	Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;	999
	Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.	999
	We do condemn thee to the very block	999
	Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.	999
	Away with him!	999
	999
MARIANA	                  O my most gracious lord,	999
	I hope you will not mock me with a husband.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.	999
	Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,	999
	I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,	999
	For that he knew you, might reproach your life	999
	And choke your good to come; for his possessions,	999
	Although by confiscation they are ours,	999
	We do instate and widow you withal,	999
	To buy you a better husband.	999
	999
MARIANA	O my dear lord,	999
	I crave no other, nor no better man.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Never crave him; we are definitive.	999
	999
MARIANA	Gentle my liege,--	999
	999
	[Kneeling]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	                  You do but lose your labour.	999
	Away with him to death!	999
	999
	[To LUCIO]	999
	999
		  Now, sir, to you.	999
	999
MARIANA	O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;	999
	Lend me your knees, and all my life to come	999
	I'll lend you all my life to do you service.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Against all sense you do importune her:	999
	Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,	999
	Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,	999
	And take her hence in horror.	999
	999
MARIANA	Isabel,	999
	Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;	999
	Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.	999
	They say, best men are moulded out of faults;	999
	And, for the most, become much more the better	999
	For being a little bad: so may my husband.	999
	O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	He dies for Claudio's death.	999
	999
ISABELLA	Most bounteous sir,	999
	999
	[Kneeling]	999
	999
	Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,	999
	As if my brother lived: I partly think	999
	A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,	999
	Till he did look on me: since it is so,	999
	Let him not die. My brother had but justice,	999
	In that he did the thing for which he died:	999
	For Angelo,	999
	His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,	999
	And must be buried but as an intent	999
	That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;	999
	Intents but merely thoughts.	999
	999
MARIANA	Merely, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.	999
	I have bethought me of another fault.	999
	Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded	999
	At an unusual hour?	999
	999
Provost	It was commanded so.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Had you a special warrant for the deed?	999
	999
Provost	No, my good lord; it was by private message.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	For which I do discharge you of your office:	999
	Give up your keys.	999
	999
Provost	                  Pardon me, noble lord:	999
	I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;	999
	Yet did repent me, after more advice;	999
	For testimony whereof, one in the prison,	999
	That should by private order else have died,	999
	I have reserved alive.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	What's he?	999
	999
Provost	His name is Barnardine.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.	999
	Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.	999
	999
	[Exit Provost]	999
	999
ESCALUS	I am sorry, one so learned and so wise	999
	As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,	999
	Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.	999
	And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.	999
	999
ANGELO	I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:	999
	And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart	999
	That I crave death more willingly than mercy;	999
	'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Provost, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO muffled,	999
	and JULIET]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Which is that Barnardine?	999
	999
Provost	This, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	There was a friar told me of this man.	999
	Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.	999
	That apprehends no further than this world,	999
	And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:	999
	But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;	999
	And pray thee take this mercy to provide	999
	For better times to come. Friar, advise him;	999
	I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?	999
	999
Provost	This is another prisoner that I saved.	999
	Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;	999
	As like almost to Claudio as himself.	999
	999
	[Unmuffles CLAUDIO]	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	[To ISABELLA]  If he be like your brother, for his sake	999
	Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,	999
	Give me your hand and say you will be mine.	999
	He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.	999
	By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;	999
	Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.	999
	Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:	999
	Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.	999
	I find an apt remission in myself;	999
	And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.	999
	999
	[To LUCIO]	999
	999
	You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,	999
	One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;	999
	Wherein have I so deserved of you,	999
	That you extol me thus?	999
	999
LUCIO	'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the	999
	trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I	999
	had rather it would please you I might be whipt.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.	999
	Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.	999
	Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,	999
	As I have heard him swear himself there's one	999
	Whom he begot with child, let her appear,	999
	And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,	999
	Let him be whipt and hang'd.	999
	999
LUCIO	I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.	999
	Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:	999
	good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.	999
	Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal	999
	Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;	999
	And see our pleasure herein executed.	999
	999
LUCIO	Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,	999
	whipping, and hanging.	999
	999
DUKE VINCENTIO	Slandering a prince deserves it.	999
	999
	[Exit Officers with LUCIO]	999
	999
	She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.	999
	Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:	999
	I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.	999
	Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:	999
	There's more behind that is more gratulate.	999
	Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:	999
	We shill employ thee in a worthier place.	999
	Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home	999
	The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:	999
	The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,	999
	I have a motion much imports your good;	999
	Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,	999
	What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.	999
	So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show	999
	What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.	999

	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Venice. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO]	999
	999
ANTONIO	In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:	999
	It wearies me; you say it wearies you;	999
	But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,	999
	What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,	999
	I am to learn;	999
	And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,	999
	That I have much ado to know myself.	999
	999
SALARINO	Your mind is tossing on the ocean;	999
	There, where your argosies with portly sail,	999
	Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,	999
	Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,	999
	Do overpeer the petty traffickers,	999
	That curtsy to them, do them reverence,	999
	As they fly by them with their woven wings.	999
	999
SALANIO	Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,	999
	The better part of my affections would	999
	Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still	999
	Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,	999
	Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;	999
	And every object that might make me fear	999
	Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt	999
	Would make me sad.	999
	999
SALARINO	                  My wind cooling my broth	999
	Would blow me to an ague, when I thought	999
	What harm a wind too great at sea might do.	999
	I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,	999
	But I should think of shallows and of flats,	999
	And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,	999
	Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs	999
	To kiss her burial. Should I go to church	999
	And see the holy edifice of stone,	999
	And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,	999
	Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,	999
	Would scatter all her spices on the stream,	999
	Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,	999
	And, in a word, but even now worth this,	999
	And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought	999
	To think on this, and shall I lack the thought	999
	That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?	999
	But tell not me; I know, Antonio	999
	Is sad to think upon his merchandise.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,	999
	My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,	999
	Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate	999
	Upon the fortune of this present year:	999
	Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.	999
	999
SALARINO	Why, then you are in love.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Fie, fie!	999
	999
SALARINO	Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,	999
	Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy	999
	For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,	999
	Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,	999
	Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:	999
	Some that will evermore peep through their eyes	999
	And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,	999
	And other of such vinegar aspect	999
	That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,	999
	Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.	999
	999
	[Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO]	999
	999
SALANIO	Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,	999
	Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:	999
	We leave you now with better company.	999
	999
SALARINO	I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,	999
	If worthier friends had not prevented me.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Your worth is very dear in my regard.	999
	I take it, your own business calls on you	999
	And you embrace the occasion to depart.	999
	999
SALARINO	Good morrow, my good lords.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?	999
	You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?	999
	999
SALARINO	We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Salarino and Salanio]	999
	999
LORENZO	My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,	999
	We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,	999
	I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.	999
	999
BASSANIO	I will not fail you.	999
	999
GRATIANO	You look not well, Signior Antonio;	999
	You have too much respect upon the world:	999
	They lose it that do buy it with much care:	999
	Believe me, you are marvellously changed.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;	999
	A stage where every man must play a part,	999
	And mine a sad one.	999
	999
GRATIANO	Let me play the fool:	999
	With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,	999
	And let my liver rather heat with wine	999
	Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.	999
	Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,	999
	Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?	999
	Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice	999
	By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--	999
	I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--	999
	There are a sort of men whose visages	999
	Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,	999
	And do a wilful stillness entertain,	999
	With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion	999
	Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,	999
	As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,	999
	And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'	999
	O my Antonio, I do know of these	999
	That therefore only are reputed wise	999
	For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,	999
	If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,	999
	Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.	999
	I'll tell thee more of this another time:	999
	But fish not, with this melancholy bait,	999
	For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.	999
	Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:	999
	I'll end my exhortation after dinner.	999
	999
LORENZO	Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:	999
	I must be one of these same dumb wise men,	999
	For Gratiano never lets me speak.	999
	999
GRATIANO	Well, keep me company but two years moe,	999
	Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.	999
	999
GRATIANO	Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable	999
	In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.	999
	999
	[Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO]	999
	999
ANTONIO	Is that any thing now?	999
	999
BASSANIO	Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more	999
	than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two	999
	grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you	999
	shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you	999
	have them, they are not worth the search.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Well, tell me now what lady is the same	999
	To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,	999
	That you to-day promised to tell me of?	999
	999
BASSANIO	'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,	999
	How much I have disabled mine estate,	999
	By something showing a more swelling port	999
	Than my faint means would grant continuance:	999
	Nor do I now make moan to be abridged	999
	From such a noble rate; but my chief care	999
	Is to come fairly off from the great debts	999
	Wherein my time something too prodigal	999
	Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,	999
	I owe the most, in money and in love,	999
	And from your love I have a warranty	999
	To unburden all my plots and purposes	999
	How to get clear of all the debts I owe.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;	999
	And if it stand, as you yourself still do,	999
	Within the eye of honour, be assured,	999
	My purse, my person, my extremest means,	999
	Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.	999
	999
BASSANIO	In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,	999
	I shot his fellow of the self-same flight	999
	The self-same way with more advised watch,	999
	To find the other forth, and by adventuring both	999
	I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,	999
	Because what follows is pure innocence.	999
	I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,	999
	That which I owe is lost; but if you please	999
	To shoot another arrow that self way	999
	Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,	999
	As I will watch the aim, or to find both	999
	Or bring your latter hazard back again	999
	And thankfully rest debtor for the first.	999
	999
ANTONIO	You know me well, and herein spend but time	999
	To wind about my love with circumstance;	999
	And out of doubt you do me now more wrong	999
	In making question of my uttermost	999
	Than if you had made waste of all I have:	999
	Then do but say to me what I should do	999
	That in your knowledge may by me be done,	999
	And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.	999
	999
BASSANIO	In Belmont is a lady richly left;	999
	And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,	999
	Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes	999
	I did receive fair speechless messages:	999
	Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued	999
	To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:	999
	Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,	999
	For the four winds blow in from every coast	999
	Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks	999
	Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;	999
	Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,	999
	And many Jasons come in quest of her.	999
	O my Antonio, had I but the means	999
	To hold a rival place with one of them,	999
	I have a mind presages me such thrift,	999
	That I should questionless be fortunate!	999
	999
ANTONIO	Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;	999
	Neither have I money nor commodity	999
	To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;	999
	Try what my credit can in Venice do:	999
	That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,	999
	To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.	999
	Go, presently inquire, and so will I,	999
	Where money is, and I no question make	999
	To have it of my trust or for my sake.	999
	999

	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PORTIA and NERISSA]	999
	999
PORTIA	By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of	999
	this great world.	999
	999
NERISSA	You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in	999
	the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and	999
	yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit	999
	with too much as they that starve with nothing. It	999
	is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the	999
	mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but	999
	competency lives longer.	999
	999
PORTIA	Good sentences and well pronounced.	999
	999
NERISSA	They would be better, if well followed.	999
	999
PORTIA	If to do were as easy as to know what were good to	999
	do, chapels had been churches and poor men's	999
	cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that	999
	follows his own instructions: I can easier teach	999
	twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the	999
	twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may	999
	devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps	999
	o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the	999
	youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the	999
	cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to	999
	choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may	999
	neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I	999
	dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed	999
	by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,	999
	Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?	999
	999
NERISSA	Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their	999
	death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,	999
	that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,	999
	silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning	999
	chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any	999
	rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what	999
	warmth is there in your affection towards any of	999
	these princely suitors that are already come?	999
	999
PORTIA	I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest	999
	them, I will describe them; and, according to my	999
	description, level at my affection.	999
	999
NERISSA	First, there is the Neapolitan prince.	999
	999
PORTIA	Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but	999
	talk of his horse; and he makes it a great	999
	appropriation to his own good parts, that he can	999
	shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his	999
	mother played false with a smith.	999
	999
NERISSA	Then there is the County Palatine.	999
	999
PORTIA	He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you	999
	will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and	999
	smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping	999
	philosopher when he grows old, being so full of	999
	unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be	999
	married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth	999
	than to either of these. God defend me from these	999
	two!	999
	999
NERISSA	How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?	999
	999
PORTIA	God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.	999
	In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,	999
	he! why, he hath a horse better than the	999
	Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than	999
	the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a	999
	throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will	999
	fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I	999
	should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me	999
	I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I	999
	shall never requite him.	999
	999
NERISSA	What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron	999
	of England?	999
	999
PORTIA	You know I say nothing to him, for he understands	999
	not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,	999
	nor Italian, and you will come into the court and	999
	swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.	999
	He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can	999
	converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!	999
	I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round	999
	hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his	999
	behavior every where.	999
	999
NERISSA	What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?	999
	999
PORTIA	That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he	999
	borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and	999
	swore he would pay him again when he was able: I	999
	think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed	999
	under for another.	999
	999
NERISSA	How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?	999
	999
PORTIA	Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and	999
	most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when	999
	he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and	999
	when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:	999
	and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall	999
	make shift to go without him.	999
	999
NERISSA	If he should offer to choose, and choose the right	999
	casket, you should refuse to perform your father's	999
	will, if you should refuse to accept him.	999
	999
PORTIA	Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a	999
	deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,	999
	for if the devil be within and that temptation	999
	without, I know he will choose it. I will do any	999
	thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.	999
	999
NERISSA	You need not fear, lady, the having any of these	999
	lords: they have acquainted me with their	999
	determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their	999
	home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless	999
	you may be won by some other sort than your father's	999
	imposition depending on the caskets.	999
	999
PORTIA	If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as	999
	chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner	999
	of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers	999
	are so reasonable, for there is not one among them	999
	but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant	999
	them a fair departure.	999
	999
NERISSA	Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a	999
	Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither	999
	in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?	999
	999
PORTIA	Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.	999
	999
NERISSA	True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish	999
	eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.	999
	999
PORTIA	I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of	999
	thy praise.	999
	999
	[Enter a Serving-man]	999
	999
	How now! what news?	999
	999
Servant	The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take	999
	their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a	999
	fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the	999
	prince his master will be here to-night.	999
	999
PORTIA	If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a	999
	heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should	999
	be glad of his approach: if he have the condition	999
	of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had	999
	rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,	999
	Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.	999
	Whiles we shut the gates	999
	upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.	999

	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	Venice. A public place.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK]	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Three thousand ducats; well.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Ay, sir, for three months.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	For three months; well.	999
	999
BASSANIO	For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Antonio shall become bound; well.	999
	999
BASSANIO	May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I	999
	know your answer?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Your answer to that.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Antonio is a good man.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a	999
	good man is to have you understand me that he is	999
	sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he	999
	hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the	999
	Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he	999
	hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and	999
	other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships	999
	are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats	999
	and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I	999
	mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,	999
	winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,	999
	sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may	999
	take his bond.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Be assured you may.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,	999
	I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?	999
	999
BASSANIO	If it please you to dine with us.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which	999
	your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I	999
	will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,	999
	walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat	999
	with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What	999
	news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter ANTONIO]	999
	999
BASSANIO	This is Signior Antonio.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	[Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!	999
	I hate him for he is a Christian,	999
	But more for that in low simplicity	999
	He lends out money gratis and brings down	999
	The rate of usance here with us in Venice.	999
	If I can catch him once upon the hip,	999
	I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.	999
	He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,	999
	Even there where merchants most do congregate,	999
	On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,	999
	Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,	999
	If I forgive him!	999
	999
BASSANIO	                  Shylock, do you hear?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I am debating of my present store,	999
	And, by the near guess of my memory,	999
	I cannot instantly raise up the gross	999
	Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?	999
	Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,	999
	Will furnish me. But soft! how many months	999
	Do you desire?	999
	999
	[To ANTONIO]	999
	999
	Rest you fair, good signior;	999
	Your worship was the last man in our mouths.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow	999
	By taking nor by giving of excess,	999
	Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,	999
	I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd	999
	How much ye would?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	                  Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.	999
	999
ANTONIO	And for three months.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I had forgot; three months; you told me so.	999
	Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;	999
	Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow	999
	Upon advantage.	999
	999
ANTONIO	                  I do never use it.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--	999
	This Jacob from our holy Abram was,	999
	As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,	999
	The third possessor; ay, he was the third--	999
	999
ANTONIO	And what of him? did he take interest?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	No, not take interest, not, as you would say,	999
	Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.	999
	When Laban and himself were compromised	999
	That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied	999
	Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,	999
	In the end of autumn turned to the rams,	999
	And, when the work of generation was	999
	Between these woolly breeders in the act,	999
	The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,	999
	And, in the doing of the deed of kind,	999
	He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,	999
	Who then conceiving did in eaning time	999
	Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.	999
	This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:	999
	And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.	999
	999
ANTONIO	This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;	999
	A thing not in his power to bring to pass,	999
	But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.	999
	Was this inserted to make interest good?	999
	Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:	999
	But note me, signior.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Mark you this, Bassanio,	999
	The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.	999
	An evil soul producing holy witness	999
	Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,	999
	A goodly apple rotten at the heart:	999
	O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.	999
	Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--	999
	999
ANTONIO	Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Signior Antonio, many a time and oft	999
	In the Rialto you have rated me	999
	About my moneys and my usances:	999
	Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,	999
	For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.	999
	You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,	999
	And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,	999
	And all for use of that which is mine own.	999
	Well then, it now appears you need my help:	999
	Go to, then; you come to me, and you say	999
	'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;	999
	You, that did void your rheum upon my beard	999
	And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur	999
	Over your threshold: moneys is your suit	999
	What should I say to you? Should I not say	999
	'Hath a dog money? is it possible	999
	A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or	999
	Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,	999
	With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;	999
	'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;	999
	You spurn'd me such a day; another time	999
	You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies	999
	I'll lend you thus much moneys'?	999
	999
ANTONIO	I am as like to call thee so again,	999
	To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.	999
	If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not	999
	As to thy friends; for when did friendship take	999
	A breed for barren metal of his friend?	999
	But lend it rather to thine enemy,	999
	Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face	999
	Exact the penalty.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	                  Why, look you, how you storm!	999
	I would be friends with you and have your love,	999
	Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,	999
	Supply your present wants and take no doit	999
	Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:	999
	This is kind I offer.	999
	999
	999
BASSANIO	This were kindness.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	This kindness will I show.	999
	Go with me to a notary, seal me there	999
	Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,	999
	If you repay me not on such a day,	999
	In such a place, such sum or sums as are	999
	Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit	999
	Be nominated for an equal pound	999
	Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken	999
	In what part of your body pleaseth me.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond	999
	And say there is much kindness in the Jew.	999
	999
BASSANIO	You shall not seal to such a bond for me:	999
	I'll rather dwell in my necessity.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:	999
	Within these two months, that's a month before	999
	This bond expires, I do expect return	999
	Of thrice three times the value of this bond.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	O father Abram, what these Christians are,	999
	Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect	999
	The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;	999
	If he should break his day, what should I gain	999
	By the exaction of the forfeiture?	999
	A pound of man's flesh taken from a man	999
	Is not so estimable, profitable neither,	999
	As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,	999
	To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:	999
	If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;	999
	And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;	999
	Give him direction for this merry bond,	999
	And I will go and purse the ducats straight,	999
	See to my house, left in the fearful guard	999
	Of an unthrifty knave, and presently	999
	I will be with you.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Hie thee, gentle Jew.	999
	999
	[Exit Shylock]	999
	999
	The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.	999
	999
BASSANIO	I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Come on: in this there can be no dismay;	999
	My ships come home a month before the day.	999
	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO	999
	and his train; PORTIA, NERISSA, and others	999
	attending]	999
	999
MOROCCO	Mislike me not for my complexion,	999
	The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,	999
	To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.	999
	Bring me the fairest creature northward born,	999
	Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,	999
	And let us make incision for your love,	999
	To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.	999
	I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine	999
	Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear	999
	The best-regarded virgins of our clime	999
	Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,	999
	Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.	999
	999
PORTIA	In terms of choice I am not solely led	999
	By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;	999
	Besides, the lottery of my destiny	999
	Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:	999
	But if my father had not scanted me	999
	And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself	999
	His wife who wins me by that means I told you,	999
	Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair	999
	As any comer I have look'd on yet	999
	For my affection.	999
	999
MOROCCO	                  Even for that I thank you:	999
	Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets	999
	To try my fortune. By this scimitar	999
	That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince	999
	That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,	999
	I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,	999
	Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,	999
	Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,	999
	Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,	999
	To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!	999
	If Hercules and Lichas play at dice	999
	Which is the better man, the greater throw	999
	May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:	999
	So is Alcides beaten by his page;	999
	And so may I, blind fortune leading me,	999
	Miss that which one unworthier may attain,	999
	And die with grieving.	999
	999
PORTIA	You must take your chance,	999
	And either not attempt to choose at all	999
	Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong	999
	Never to speak to lady afterward	999
	In way of marriage: therefore be advised.	999
	999
MOROCCO	Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.	999
	999
PORTIA	First, forward to the temple: after dinner	999
	Your hazard shall be made.	999
	999
MOROCCO	Good fortune then!	999
	To make me blest or cursed'st among men.	999

	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	999
	999
	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Venice. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LAUNCELOT]	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from	999
	this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and	999
	tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good	999
	Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot	999
	Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My	999
	conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;	999
	take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest	999
	Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy	999
	heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me	999
	pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the	999
	fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'	999
	says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,	999
	hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely	999
	to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest	999
	man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,	999
	indeed, my father did something smack, something	999
	grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience	999
	says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the	999
	fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.	999
	'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'	999
	say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my	999
	conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,	999
	who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to	999
	run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the	999
	fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil	999
	himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil	999
	incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is	999
	but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel	999
	me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more	999
	friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are	999
	at your command; I will run.	999
	999
	[Enter Old GOBBO, with a basket]	999
	999
GOBBO	Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way	999
	to master Jew's?	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	[Aside]  O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!	999
	who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,	999
	knows me not: I will try confusions with him.	999
	999
GOBBO	Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way	999
	to master Jew's?	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,	999
	at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at	999
	the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn	999
	down indirectly to the Jew's house.	999
	999
GOBBO	By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can	999
	you tell me whether one Launcelot,	999
	that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Talk you of young Master Launcelot?	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you	999
	of young Master Launcelot?	999
	999
GOBBO	No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,	999
	though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man	999
	and, God be thanked, well to live.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of	999
	young Master Launcelot.	999
	999
GOBBO	Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,	999
	talk you of young Master Launcelot?	999
	999
GOBBO	Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master	999
	Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,	999
	according to Fates and Destinies and such odd	999
	sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of	999
	learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say	999
	in plain terms, gone to heaven.	999
	999
GOBBO	Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my	999
	age, my very prop.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or	999
	a prop? Do you know me, father?	999
	999
GOBBO	Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:	999
	but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his	999
	soul, alive or dead?	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Do you not know me, father?	999
	999
GOBBO	Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of	999
	the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his	999
	own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of	999
	your son: give me your blessing: truth will come	999
	to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son	999
	may, but at the length truth will out.	999
	999
GOBBO	Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not	999
	Launcelot, my boy.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but	999
	give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy	999
	that was, your son that is, your child that shall	999
	be.	999
	999
GOBBO	I cannot think you are my son.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	I know not what I shall think of that: but I am	999
	Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your	999
	wife is my mother.	999
	999
GOBBO	Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou	999
	be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.	999
	Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou	999
	got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than	999
	Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows	999
	backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail	999
	than I have of my face when I last saw him.	999
	999
GOBBO	Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy	999
	master agree? I have brought him a present. How	999
	'gree you now?	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set	999
	up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I	999
	have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give	999
	him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in	999
	his service; you may tell every finger I have with	999
	my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me	999
	your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,	999
	gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I	999
	will run as far as God has any ground. O rare	999
	fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I	999
	am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.	999
	999
	[Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followers]	999
	999
BASSANIO	You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper	999
	be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See	999
	these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,	999
	and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.	999
	999
	[Exit a Servant]	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	To him, father.	999
	999
GOBBO	God bless your worship!	999
	999
BASSANIO	Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?	999
	999
GOBBO	Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that	999
	would, sir, as my father shall specify--	999
	999
GOBBO	He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,	999
	and have a desire, as my father shall specify--	999
	999
GOBBO	His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,	999
	are scarce cater-cousins--	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having	999
	done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I	999
	hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--	999
	999
GOBBO	I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon	999
	your worship, and my suit is--	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as	999
	your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,	999
	though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.	999
	999
BASSANIO	One speak for both. What would you?	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Serve you, sir.	999
	999
GOBBO	That is the very defect of the matter, sir.	999
	999
BASSANIO	I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:	999
	Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,	999
	And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment	999
	To leave a rich Jew's service, to become	999
	The follower of so poor a gentleman.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	The old proverb is very well parted between my	999
	master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of	999
	God, sir, and he hath enough.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.	999
	Take leave of thy old master and inquire	999
	My lodging out. Give him a livery	999
	More guarded than his fellows': see it done.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have	999
	ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in	999
	Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear	999
	upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,	999
	here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle	999
	of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven	999
	widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one	999
	man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be	999
	in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;	999
	here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a	999
	woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,	999
	come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Launcelot and Old Gobbo]	999
	999
BASSANIO	I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:	999
	These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,	999
	Return in haste, for I do feast to-night	999
	My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.	999
	999
LEONARDO	My best endeavours shall be done herein.	999

	999
GRATIANO	Signior Bassanio!	999
	999
BASSANIO	Gratiano!	999
	999
GRATIANO	I have a suit to you.	999
	999
BASSANIO	You have obtain'd it.	999
	999
GRATIANO	You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;	999
	Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;	999
	Parts that become thee happily enough	999
	And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;	999
	But where thou art not known, why, there they show	999
	Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain	999
	To allay with some cold drops of modesty	999
	Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior	999
	I be misconstrued in the place I go to,	999
	And lose my hopes.	999
	999
GRATIANO	                  Signior Bassanio, hear me:	999
	If I do not put on a sober habit,	999
	Talk with respect and swear but now and then,	999
	Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,	999
	Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes	999
	Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'	999
	Use all the observance of civility,	999
	Like one well studied in a sad ostent	999
	To please his grandam, never trust me more.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Well, we shall see your bearing.	999
	999
GRATIANO	Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me	999
	By what we do to-night.	999
	999
BASSANIO	No, that were pity:	999
	I would entreat you rather to put on	999
	Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends	999
	That purpose merriment. But fare you well:	999
	I have some business.	999
	999
GRATIANO	And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:	999
	But we will visit you at supper-time.	999

	999
	[Enter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT]	999
	999
JESSICA	I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:	999
	Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,	999
	Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.	999
	But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:	999
	And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see	999
	Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:	999
	Give him this letter; do it secretly;	999
	And so farewell: I would not have my father	999
	See me in talk with thee.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful	999
	pagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play	999
	the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But,	999
	adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my	999
	manly spirit: adieu.	999
	999
JESSICA	Farewell, good Launcelot.	999
	999
	[Exit Launcelot]	999
	999
	Alack, what heinous sin is it in me	999
	To be ashamed to be my father's child!	999
	But though I am a daughter to his blood,	999

	All in an hour.	999
	999
GRATIANO	We have not made good preparation.	999
	999
SALARINO	We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.	999
	999
SALANIO	'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,	999
	And better in my mind not undertook.	999
	999
LORENZO	'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours	999
	To furnish us.	999

	[Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter]	999
	999
	Friend Launcelot, what's the news?	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	An it shall please you to break up	999
	this, it shall seem to signify.	999
	999
LORENZO	I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;	999
	And whiter than the paper it writ on	999

	999
GRATIANO	Love-news, in faith.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	By your leave, sir.	999

LORENZO	Whither goest thou?	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Marry, sir, to bid my old master the	999

	I will not fail her; speak it privately.	999
	Go, gentlemen,	999

	[Exit Launcelot]	999

	Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?	999

	And never dare misfortune cross her foot,	999
	Unless she do it under this excuse,	999

LAUNCELOT	Why, Jessica!	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.	999
	999

	I could do nothing without bidding.	999
	999

	999
JESSICA	Call you? what is your will?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:	999
	There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?	999
	I am not bid for love; they flatter me:	999
	But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon	999
	The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,	999
	Look to my house. I am right loath to go:	999
	There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,	999
	For I did dream of money-bags to-night.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect	999
	your reproach.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	So do I his.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	An they have conspired together, I will not say you	999
	shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not	999
	for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on	999
	Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,	999
	falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four	999
	year, in the afternoon.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:	999
	Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum	999
	And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,	999
	Clamber not you up to the casements then,	999
	Nor thrust your head into the public street	999
	To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,	999
	But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:	999
	Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter	999
	My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,	999
	I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:	999
	But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;	999
	Say I will come.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at	999
	window, for all this, There will come a Christian	999
	boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.	999

SHYLOCK	What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?	999

JESSICA	His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing else.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;	999
	Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day	999
	More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;	999
	Therefore I part with him, and part with him	999
	To one that would have him help to waste	999
	His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;	999
	Perhaps I will return immediately:	999
	Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:	999
	Fast bind, fast find;	999
	A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.	999

	To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont	999
	To keep obliged faith unforfeited!	999

GRATIANO	That ever holds: who riseth from a feast	999
	With that keen appetite that he sits down?	999
	Where is the horse that doth untread again	999
	His tedious measures with the unbated fire	999
	That he did pace them first? All things that are,	999
	Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.	999
	How like a younker or a prodigal	999

	Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.	999
	999
LORENZO	Lorenzo, and thy love.	999
	999
JESSICA	Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,	999
	For who love I so much? And now who knows	999
	But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?	999
	999
LORENZO	Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.	999
	999
JESSICA	Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.	999
	I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,	999
	For I am much ashamed of my exchange:	999
	But love is blind and lovers cannot see	999
	The pretty follies that themselves commit;	999
	For if they could, Cupid himself would blush	999
	To see me thus transformed to a boy.	999
	999
LORENZO	Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.	999
	999
JESSICA	What, must I hold a candle to my shames?	999
	They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.	999
	Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;	999
	And I should be obscured.	999
	999
LORENZO	So are you, sweet,	999
	Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.	999
	But come at once;	999
	For the close night doth play the runaway,	999
	And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.	999
	999

	With some more ducats, and be with you straight.	999

	999
MOROCCO	The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,	999
	'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'	999
	The second, silver, which this promise carries,	999
	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'	999
	This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,	999
	'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'	999
	How shall I know if I do choose the right?	999
	999
PORTIA	The one of them contains my picture, prince:	999
	If you choose that, then I am yours withal.	999
	999
MOROCCO	Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;	999
	I will survey the inscriptions back again.	999
	What says this leaden casket?	999
	'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'	999
	Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?	999
	This casket threatens. Men that hazard all	999
	Do it in hope of fair advantages:	999
	A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;	999
	I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.	999
	What says the silver with her virgin hue?	999
	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'	999
	As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,	999
	And weigh thy value with an even hand:	999
	If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,	999
	Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough	999
	May not extend so far as to the lady:	999
	And yet to be afeard of my deserving	999
	Were but a weak disabling of myself.	999
	As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:	999
	I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,	999
	In graces and in qualities of breeding;	999
	But more than these, in love I do deserve.	999
	What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?	999
	Let's see once more this saying graved in gold	999
	'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'	999
	Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;	999
	From the four corners of the earth they come,	999
	To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:	999
	The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds	999
	Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now	999
	For princes to come view fair Portia:	999
	The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head	999
	Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar	999
	To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,	999
	As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.	999
	One of these three contains her heavenly picture.	999
	Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation	999
	To think so base a thought: it were too gross	999
	To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.	999
	Or shall I think in silver she's immured,	999
	Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?	999
	O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem	999
	Was set in worse than gold. They have in England	999
	A coin that bears the figure of an angel	999
	Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;	999
	But here an angel in a golden bed	999
	Lies all within. Deliver me the key:	999
	Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!	999
	999
PORTIA	There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,	999
	Then I am yours.	999
	999
	[He unlocks the golden casket]	999
	999
MOROCCO	                  O hell! what have we here?	999
	A carrion Death, within whose empty eye	999
	There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	All that glitters is not gold;	999
	Often have you heard that told:	999
	Many a man his life hath sold	999
	But my outside to behold:	999
	Gilded tombs do worms enfold.	999
	Had you been as wise as bold,	999
	Young in limbs, in judgment old,	999
	Your answer had not been inscroll'd:	999
	Fare you well; your suit is cold.	999
	Cold, indeed; and labour lost:	999
	Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!	999
	Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart	999
	To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.	999
	999
	[Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets]	999
	999
PORTIA	A gentle riddance. Draw the curtains, go.	999
	Let all of his complexion choose me so.	999

	[Enter SALARINO and SALANIO]	999
	999
SALARINO	Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:	999
	With him is Gratiano gone along;	999
	And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.	999
	999
SALANIO	The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,	999
	Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.	999
	999
SALARINO	He came too late, the ship was under sail:	999
	But there the duke was given to understand	999
	That in a gondola were seen together	999
	Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:	999
	Besides, Antonio certified the duke	999
	They were not with Bassanio in his ship.	999
	999
SALANIO	I never heard a passion so confused,	999
	So strange, outrageous, and so variable,	999
	As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:	999
	'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!	999
	Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!	999
	Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!	999
	A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,	999
	Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!	999
	And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,	999
	Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;	999
	She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'	999
	999
SALARINO	Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,	999
	Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.	999
	999
SALANIO	Let good Antonio look he keep his day,	999
	Or he shall pay for this.	999
	999
SALARINO	Marry, well remember'd.	999
	I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,	999
	Who told me, in the narrow seas that part	999
	The French and English, there miscarried	999
	A vessel of our country richly fraught:	999
	I thought upon Antonio when he told me;	999
	And wish'd in silence that it were not his.	999
	999
SALANIO	You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;	999
	Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.	999
	999
SALARINO	A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.	999
	I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:	999
	Bassanio told him he would make some speed	999
	Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;	999
	Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio	999
	But stay the very riping of the time;	999
	And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,	999
	Let it not enter in your mind of love:	999
	Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts	999
	To courtship and such fair ostents of love	999
	As shall conveniently become you there:'	999
	And even there, his eye being big with tears,	999
	Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,	999
	And with affection wondrous sensible	999
	He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.	999
	999
SALANIO	I think he only loves the world for him.	999
	I pray thee, let us go and find him out	999
	And quicken his embraced heaviness	999
	With some delight or other.	999
	999

SCENE IX	Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter NERISSA with a Servitor]	999
	999
NERISSA	Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:	999
	The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,	999
	And comes to his election presently.	999
	999
	[Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON,	999
	PORTIA, and their trains]	999
	999
PORTIA	Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:	999
	If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,	999
	Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:	999
	But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,	999
	You must be gone from hence immediately.	999
	999
ARRAGON	I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:	999
	First, never to unfold to any one	999
	Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail	999
	Of the right casket, never in my life	999
	To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,	999
	If I do fail in fortune of my choice,	999
	Immediately to leave you and be gone.	999
	999
PORTIA	To these injunctions every one doth swear	999
	That comes to hazard for my worthless self.	999
	999
ARRAGON	And so have I address'd me. Fortune now	999
	To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.	999
	'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'	999
	You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.	999
	What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:	999
	'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'	999
	What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant	999
	By the fool multitude, that choose by show,	999
	Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;	999
	Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,	999
	Builds in the weather on the outward wall,	999
	Even in the force and road of casualty.	999
	I will not choose what many men desire,	999
	Because I will not jump with common spirits	999
	And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.	999
	Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;	999
	Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:	999
	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'	999
	And well said too; for who shall go about	999
	To cozen fortune and be honourable	999
	Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume	999
	To wear an undeserved dignity.	999
	O, that estates, degrees and offices	999
	Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour	999
	Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!	999
	How many then should cover that stand bare!	999
	How many be commanded that command!	999
	How much low peasantry would then be glean'd	999
	From the true seed of honour! and how much honour	999
	Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times	999
	To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:	999
	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'	999
	I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,	999
	And instantly unlock my fortunes here.	999
	999
	[He opens the silver casket]	999
	999
PORTIA	Too long a pause for that which you find there.	999
	999
ARRAGON	What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,	999
	Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.	999
	How much unlike art thou to Portia!	999
	How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!	999
	'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'	999
	Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?	999
	Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?	999
	999
PORTIA	To offend, and judge, are distinct offices	999
	And of opposed natures.	999
	999
ARRAGON	What is here?	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	The fire seven times tried this:	999
	Seven times tried that judgment is,	999
	That did never choose amiss.	999
	Some there be that shadows kiss;	999
	Such have but a shadow's bliss:	999
	There be fools alive, I wis,	999
	Silver'd o'er; and so was this.	999
	Take what wife you will to bed,	999
	I will ever be your head:	999
	So be gone: you are sped.	999
	Still more fool I shall appear	999
	By the time I linger here	999
	With one fool's head I came to woo,	999
	But I go away with two.	999
	Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,	999
	Patiently to bear my wroth.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Arragon and train]	999
	999
PORTIA	Thus hath the candle singed the moth.	999
	O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,	999
	They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.	999
	999
NERISSA	The ancient saying is no heresy,	999
	Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.	999
	999
PORTIA	Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.	999

	[Enter a Servant]	999

Servant	Where is my lady?	999
	999
PORTIA	                  Here: what would my lord?	999
	999
Servant	Madam, there is alighted at your gate	999
	A young Venetian, one that comes before	999
	To signify the approaching of his lord;	999
	From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,	999
	To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,	999
	Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen	999
	So likely an ambassador of love:	999
	A day in April never came so sweet,	999
	To show how costly summer was at hand,	999
	As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.	999
	999
PORTIA	No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard	999
	Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,	999
	Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.	999
	Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see	999
	Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.	999

	999
SCENE I	Venice. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SALANIO and SALARINO]	999
	999
SALANIO	Now, what news on the Rialto?	999
	999
SALARINO	Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath	999
	a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;	999
	the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very	999
	dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many	999
	a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip	999
	Report be an honest woman of her word.	999
	999
SALANIO	I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever	999
	knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she	999
	wept for the death of a third husband. But it is	999
	true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the	999
	plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the	999
	honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough	999
	to keep his name company!--	999
	999
SALARINO	Come, the full stop.	999
	999
SALANIO	Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath	999
	lost a ship.	999
	999
SALARINO	I would it might prove the end of his losses.	999
	999
SALANIO	Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my	999
	prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.	999
	999
	[Enter SHYLOCK]	999
	999
	How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my	999
	daughter's flight.	999
	999
SALARINO	That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor	999
	that made the wings she flew withal.	999
	999
SALANIO	And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was	999
	fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all	999
	to leave the dam.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	She is damned for it.	999
	999
SALANIO	That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	My own flesh and blood to rebel!	999
	999
SALANIO	Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.	999
	999
SALARINO	There is more difference between thy flesh and hers	999
	than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods	999
	than there is between red wine and rhenish. But	999
	tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any	999
	loss at sea or no?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a	999
	prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the	999
	Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon	999
	the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to	999
	call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was	999
	wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him	999
	look to his bond.	999
	999
SALARINO	Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take	999
	his flesh: what's that good for?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,	999
	it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and	999
	hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,	999
	mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my	999
	bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine	999
	enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath	999
	not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,	999
	dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with	999
	the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject	999
	to the same diseases, healed by the same means,	999
	warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as	999
	a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?	999
	if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison	999
	us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not	999
	revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will	999
	resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,	999
	what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian	999
	wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by	999
	Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you	999
	teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I	999
	will better the instruction.	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
Servant	Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and	999
	desires to speak with you both.	999
	999
SALARINO	We have been up and down to seek him.	999
	999
	[Enter TUBAL]	999

SALANIO	Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be	999
	matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.	999
	999
	[Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant]	999
	999
SHYLOCK	How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou	999
	found my daughter?	999
	999
TUBAL	I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,	999
	cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse	999
	never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it	999
	till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other	999
	precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter	999
	were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!	999
	would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in	999
	her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know	999
	not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon	999
	loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to	999
	find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:	999
	nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my	999
	shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears	999
	but of my shedding.	999
	999
TUBAL	Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I	999
	heard in Genoa,--	999
	999
SHYLOCK	What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?	999
	999
TUBAL	Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?	999
	999
TUBAL	I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!	999
	ha, ha! where? in Genoa?	999
	999
TUBAL	Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one	999
	night fourscore ducats.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my	999
	gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!	999
	fourscore ducats!	999
	999
TUBAL	There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my	999
	company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture	999
	him: I am glad of it.	999
	999
TUBAL	One of them showed me a ring that he had of your	999
	daughter for a monkey.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my	999
	turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:	999
	I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.	999
	999
TUBAL	But Antonio is certainly undone.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee	999
	me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I	999
	will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were	999
	he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I	999
	will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;	999
	go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.	999

	Hate counsels not in such a quality.	999
	But lest you should not understand me well,--	999
	And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--	999
	I would detain you here some month or two	999
	Before you venture for me. I could teach you	999
	How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;	999
	So will I never be: so may you miss me;	999
	But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,	999
	That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,	999
	They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;	999
	One half of me is yours, the other half yours,	999
	Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,	999
	And so all yours. O, these naughty times	999
	Put bars between the owners and their rights!	999
	And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,	999
	Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.	999
	I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,	999
	To eke it and to draw it out in length,	999
	To stay you from election.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Let me choose	999
	For as I am, I live upon the rack.	999
	999
PORTIA	Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess	999
	What treason there is mingled with your love.	999
	999
BASSANIO	None but that ugly treason of mistrust,	999
	Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:	999
	There may as well be amity and life	999
	'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.	999
	999
PORTIA	Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,	999
	Where men enforced do speak anything.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.	999
	999
PORTIA	Well then, confess and live.	999
	999
BASSANIO	'Confess' and 'love'	999
	Had been the very sum of my confession:	999
	O happy torment, when my torturer	999
	Doth teach me answers for deliverance!	999
	But let me to my fortune and the caskets.	999
	999
PORTIA	Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:	999
	If you do love me, you will find me out.	999
	Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.	999
	Let music sound while he doth make his choice;	999
	Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,	999
	Fading in music: that the comparison	999
	May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream	999
	And watery death-bed for him. He may win;	999
	And what is music then? Then music is	999
	Even as the flourish when true subjects bow	999
	To a new-crowned monarch: such it is	999
	As are those dulcet sounds in break of day	999
	That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,	999
	And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,	999
	With no less presence, but with much more love,	999
	Than young Alcides, when he did redeem	999
	The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy	999
	To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice	999
	The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,	999
	With bleared visages, come forth to view	999
	The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!	999
	Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay	999
	I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.	999
	999
	[Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself]	999
		999
	SONG.	999
	Tell me where is fancy bred,	999
	Or in the heart, or in the head?	999
	How begot, how nourished?	999
	Reply, reply.	999
	It is engender'd in the eyes,	999
	With gazing fed; and fancy dies	999
	In the cradle where it lies.	999
	Let us all ring fancy's knell	999
	I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.	999
	999
ALL	Ding, dong, bell.	999
	999
BASSANIO	So may the outward shows be least themselves:	999
	The world is still deceived with ornament.	999
	In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,	999
	But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,	999
	Obscures the show of evil? In religion,	999
	What damned error, but some sober brow	999
	Will bless it and approve it with a text,	999
	Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?	999
	There is no vice so simple but assumes	999
	Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:	999
	How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false	999
	As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins	999
	The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;	999
	Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;	999
	And these assume but valour's excrement	999
	To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,	999
	And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;	999
	Which therein works a miracle in nature,	999
	Making them lightest that wear most of it:	999
	So are those crisped snaky golden locks	999
	Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,	999
	Upon supposed fairness, often known	999
	To be the dowry of a second head,	999
	The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.	999
	Thus ornament is but the guiled shore	999
	To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf	999
	Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,	999
	The seeming truth which cunning times put on	999
	To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,	999
	Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;	999
	Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge	999
	'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,	999
	Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,	999
	Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;	999
	And here choose I; joy be the consequence!	999
	999
PORTIA	[Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,	999
	As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,	999
	And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,	999
	Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,	999
	In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.	999
	I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,	999
	For fear I surfeit.	999
	999
BASSANIO	What find I here?	999
	999
	[Opening the leaden casket]	999
	999
	Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god	999
	Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?	999
	Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,	999
	Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,	999
	Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar	999
	Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs	999
	The painter plays the spider and hath woven	999
	A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,	999
	Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--	999
	How could he see to do them? having made one,	999
	Methinks it should have power to steal both his	999
	And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far	999
	The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow	999
	In underprizing it, so far this shadow	999
	Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,	999
	The continent and summary of my fortune.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	You that choose not by the view,	999
	Chance as fair and choose as true!	999
	Since this fortune falls to you,	999
	Be content and seek no new,	999
	If you be well pleased with this	999
	And hold your fortune for your bliss,	999
	Turn you where your lady is	999
	And claim her with a loving kiss.	999
	A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;	999
	I come by note, to give and to receive.	999
	Like one of two contending in a prize,	999
	That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,	999
	Hearing applause and universal shout,	999
	Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt	999
	Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;	999
	So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;	999
	As doubtful whether what I see be true,	999
	Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.	999
	999
PORTIA	You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,	999
	Such as I am: though for myself alone	999
	I would not be ambitious in my wish,	999
	To wish myself much better; yet, for you	999
	I would be trebled twenty times myself;	999
	A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;	999
	That only to stand high in your account,	999
	I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,	999
	Exceed account; but the full sum of me	999
	Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,	999
	Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;	999
	Happy in this, she is not yet so old	999
	But she may learn; happier than this,	999
	She is not bred so dull but she can learn;	999
	Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit	999
	Commits itself to yours to be directed,	999
	As from her lord, her governor, her king.	999
	Myself and what is mine to you and yours	999
	Is now converted: but now I was the lord	999
	Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,	999
	Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,	999
	This house, these servants and this same myself	999
	Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;	999
	Which when you part from, lose, or give away,	999
	Let it presage the ruin of your love	999
	And be my vantage to exclaim on you.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Madam, you have bereft me of all words,	999
	Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;	999
	And there is such confusion in my powers,	999
	As after some oration fairly spoke	999
	By a beloved prince, there doth appear	999
	Among the buzzing pleased multitude;	999
	Where every something, being blent together,	999
	Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,	999
	Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring	999
	Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:	999
	O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!	999
	999
NERISSA	My lord and lady, it is now our time,	999
	That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,	999
	To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!	999
	999
GRATIANO	My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,	999
	I wish you all the joy that you can wish;	999
	For I am sure you can wish none from me:	999
	And when your honours mean to solemnize	999
	The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,	999
	Even at that time I may be married too.	999
	999
BASSANIO	With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.	999
	999
GRATIANO	I thank your lordship, you have got me one.	999
	My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:	999
	You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;	999
	You loved, I loved for intermission.	999
	No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.	999
	Your fortune stood upon the casket there,	999
	And so did mine too, as the matter falls;	999
	For wooing here until I sweat again,	999
	And sweating until my very roof was dry	999
	With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,	999
	I got a promise of this fair one here	999
	To have her love, provided that your fortune	999
	Achieved her mistress.	999
	999
PORTIA	Is this true, Nerissa?	999
	999
NERISSA	Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.	999
	999
BASSANIO	And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?	999
	999
GRATIANO	Yes, faith, my lord.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.	999
	999
GRATIANO	We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.	999
	999
NERISSA	What, and stake down?	999
	999
GRATIANO	No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.	999
	But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,	999
	and my old Venetian friend Salerio?	999
	999
	[Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger	999
	from Venice]	999
	999
BASSANIO	Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;	999
	If that the youth of my new interest here	999
	Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,	999
	I bid my very friends and countrymen,	999
	Sweet Portia, welcome.	999
	999
PORTIA	So do I, my lord:	999
	They are entirely welcome.	999
	999
LORENZO	I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,	999
	My purpose was not to have seen you here;	999
	But meeting with Salerio by the way,	999
	He did entreat me, past all saying nay,	999
	To come with him along.	999
	999
SALERIO	I did, my lord;	999
	And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio	999
	Commends him to you.	999
	999
	[Gives Bassanio a letter]	999
	999
BASSANIO	Ere I ope his letter,	999
	I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.	999
	999
SALERIO	Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;	999
	Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there	999
	Will show you his estate.	999
	999
GRATIANO	Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.	999
	Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?	999
	How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?	999
	I know he will be glad of our success;	999
	We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.	999
	999
SALERIO	I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.	999
	999
PORTIA	There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,	999
	That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:	999
	Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world	999
	Could turn so much the constitution	999
	Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!	999
	With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,	999
	And I must freely have the half of anything	999
	That this same paper brings you.	999
	999
BASSANIO	O sweet Portia,	999
	Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words	999
	That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,	999
	When I did first impart my love to you,	999
	I freely told you, all the wealth I had	999
	Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;	999
	And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,	999
	Rating myself at nothing, you shall see	999
	How much I was a braggart. When I told you	999
	My state was nothing, I should then have told you	999
	That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,	999
	I have engaged myself to a dear friend,	999
	Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,	999
	To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;	999
	The paper as the body of my friend,	999
	And every word in it a gaping wound,	999
	Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?	999
	Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?	999
	From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,	999
	From Lisbon, Barbary and India?	999
	And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch	999
	Of merchant-marring rocks?	999
	999
SALERIO	Not one, my lord.	999
	Besides, it should appear, that if he had	999
	The present money to discharge the Jew,	999
	He would not take it. Never did I know	999
	A creature, that did bear the shape of man,	999
	So keen and greedy to confound a man:	999
	He plies the duke at morning and at night,	999
	And doth impeach the freedom of the state,	999
	If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,	999
	The duke himself, and the magnificoes	999
	Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;	999
	But none can drive him from the envious plea	999
	Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.	999
	999
JESSICA	When I was with him I have heard him swear	999
	To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,	999
	That he would rather have Antonio's flesh	999
	Than twenty times the value of the sum	999
	That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,	999
	If law, authority and power deny not,	999
	It will go hard with poor Antonio.	999
	999
PORTIA	Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?	999
	999
BASSANIO	The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,	999
	The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit	999
	In doing courtesies, and one in whom	999
	The ancient Roman honour more appears	999
	Than any that draws breath in Italy.	999
	999
PORTIA	What sum owes he the Jew?	999
	999
BASSANIO	For me three thousand ducats.	999
	999
PORTIA	What, no more?	999
	Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;	999
	Double six thousand, and then treble that,	999
	Before a friend of this description	999
	Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.	999
	First go with me to church and call me wife,	999
	And then away to Venice to your friend;	999
	For never shall you lie by Portia's side	999
	With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold	999
	To pay the petty debt twenty times over:	999
	When it is paid, bring your true friend along.	999
	My maid Nerissa and myself meantime	999
	Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!	999
	For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:	999
	Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:	999
	Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.	999
	But let me hear the letter of your friend.	999
	999
BASSANIO	[Reads]  Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all	999
	miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is	999
	very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since	999
	in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all	999
	debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but	999
	see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your	999
	pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,	999
	let not my letter.	999
	999
PORTIA	O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!	999
	999
BASSANIO	Since I have your good leave to go away,	999
	I will make haste: but, till I come again,	999
	No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,	999
	No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.	999

	[Enter SHYLOCK, SALARINO, ANTONIO, and Gaoler]	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;	999
	This is the fool that lent out money gratis:	999
	Gaoler, look to him.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Hear me yet, good Shylock.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:	999
	I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.	999
	Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;	999
	But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:	999
	The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,	999
	Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond	999
	To come abroad with him at his request.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I pray thee, hear me speak.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:	999
	I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.	999
	I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,	999
	To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield	999
	To Christian intercessors. Follow not;	999
	I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SALARINO	It is the most impenetrable cur	999
	That ever kept with men.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Let him alone:	999
	I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.	999
	He seeks my life; his reason well I know:	999
	I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures	999
	Many that have at times made moan to me;	999
	Therefore he hates me.	999
	999
SALARINO	I am sure the duke	999
	Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.	999
	999
ANTONIO	The duke cannot deny the course of law:	999
	For the commodity that strangers have	999
	With us in Venice, if it be denied,	999
	Will much impeach the justice of his state;	999
	Since that the trade and profit of the city	999
	Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:	999
	These griefs and losses have so bated me,	999
	That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh	999
	To-morrow to my bloody creditor.	999
	Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come	999
	To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!	999

SCENE IV	Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and	999
	BALTHASAR]	999
	999
LORENZO	Madam, although I speak it in your presence,	999
	You have a noble and a true conceit	999
	Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly	999
	In bearing thus the absence of your lord.	999
	But if you knew to whom you show this honour,	999
	How true a gentleman you send relief,	999
	How dear a lover of my lord your husband,	999
	I know you would be prouder of the work	999
	Than customary bounty can enforce you.	999
	999
PORTIA	I never did repent for doing good,	999
	Nor shall not now: for in companions	999
	That do converse and waste the time together,	999
	Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,	999
	There must be needs a like proportion	999
	Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;	999
	Which makes me think that this Antonio,	999
	Being the bosom lover of my lord,	999
	Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,	999
	How little is the cost I have bestow'd	999
	In purchasing the semblance of my soul	999
	From out the state of hellish misery!	999
	This comes too near the praising of myself;	999
	Therefore no more of it: hear other things.	999
	Lorenzo, I commit into your hands	999
	The husbandry and manage of my house	999
	Until my lord's return: for mine own part,	999
	I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow	999
	To live in prayer and contemplation,	999
	Only attended by Nerissa here,	999
	Until her husband and my lord's return:	999
	There is a monastery two miles off;	999
	And there will we abide. I do desire you	999
	Not to deny this imposition;	999
	The which my love and some necessity	999
	Now lays upon you.	999
	999
LORENZO	                  Madam, with all my heart;	999
	I shall obey you in all fair commands.	999
	999
PORTIA	My people do already know my mind,	999
	And will acknowledge you and Jessica	999
	In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.	999
	And so farewell, till we shall meet again.	999
	999
LORENZO	Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!	999
	999
JESSICA	I wish your ladyship all heart's content.	999
	999
PORTIA	I thank you for your wish, and am well pleased	999
	To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.	999
	999
	[Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO]	999
	999
	Now, Balthasar,	999
	As I have ever found thee honest-true,	999
	So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,	999
	And use thou all the endeavour of a man	999
	In speed to Padua: see thou render this	999
	Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;	999
	And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,	999
	Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed	999
	Unto the tranect, to the common ferry	999
	Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,	999
	But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	Madam, I go with all convenient speed.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PORTIA	Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand	999
	That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands	999
	Before they think of us.	999
	999
NERISSA	Shall they see us?	999
	999
PORTIA	They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,	999
	That they shall think we are accomplished	999
	With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,	999
	When we are both accoutred like young men,	999
	I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,	999
	And wear my dagger with the braver grace,	999
	And speak between the change of man and boy	999
	With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps	999
	Into a manly stride, and speak of frays	999
	Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,	999
	How honourable ladies sought my love,	999
	Which I denying, they fell sick and died;	999
	I could not do withal; then I'll repent,	999
	And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;	999
	And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,	999
	That men shall swear I have discontinued school	999
	Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind	999
	A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,	999
	Which I will practise.	999
	999
NERISSA	Why, shall we turn to men?	999
	999
PORTIA	Fie, what a question's that,	999
	If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!	999
	But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device	999
	When I am in my coach, which stays for us	999
	At the park gate; and therefore haste away,	999
	For we must measure twenty miles to-day.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE V	The same. A garden.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA]	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father	999
	are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I	999
	promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with	999
	you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:	999
	therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you	999
	are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do	999
	you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard	999
	hope neither.	999
	999
JESSICA	And what hope is that, I pray thee?	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you	999
	not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.	999
	999
JESSICA	That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the	999
	sins of my mother should be visited upon me.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and	999
	mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I	999
	fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are	999
	gone both ways.	999
	999
JESSICA	I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a	999
	Christian.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians	999
	enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by	999
	another. This making Christians will raise the	999
	price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we	999
	shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.	999
	999
	[Enter LORENZO]	999
	999
JESSICA	I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.	999
	999
LORENZO	I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if	999
	you thus get my wife into corners.	999
	999
JESSICA	Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I	999
	are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for	999
	me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he	999
	says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,	999
	for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the	999
	price of pork.	999
	999
LORENZO	I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than	999
	you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the	999
	Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:	999
	but if she be less than an honest woman, she is	999
	indeed more than I took her for.	999
	999
LORENZO	How every fool can play upon the word! I think the	999
	best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,	999
	and discourse grow commendable in none only but	999
	parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.	999
	999
LORENZO	Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid	999
	them prepare dinner.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.	999
	999
LORENZO	Will you cover then, sir?	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.	999
	999
LORENZO	Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show	999
	the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray	999
	tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:	999
	go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve	999
	in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the	999
	meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in	999
	to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and	999
	conceits shall govern.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LORENZO	O dear discretion, how his words are suited!	999
	The fool hath planted in his memory	999
	An army of good words; and I do know	999
	A many fools, that stand in better place,	999
	Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word	999
	Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?	999
	And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,	999
	How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?	999
	999
JESSICA	Past all expressing. It is very meet	999
	The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;	999
	For, having such a blessing in his lady,	999
	He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;	999
	And if on earth he do not mean it, then	999
	In reason he should never come to heaven	999
	Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match	999
	And on the wager lay two earthly women,	999
	And Portia one, there must be something else	999
	Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world	999
	Hath not her fellow.	999
	999
LORENZO	Even such a husband	999
	Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.	999
	999
JESSICA	Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.	999
	999
LORENZO	I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.	999
	999
JESSICA	Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.	999
	999
LORENZO	No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;	999
'	Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things	999
	I shall digest it.	999
	999
JESSICA	                  Well, I'll set you forth.	999

	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	999
	999
	999
ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Venice. A court of justice.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO,	999
	GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others]	999
	999
DUKE	What, is Antonio here?	999
	999
ANTONIO	Ready, so please your grace.	999
	999
DUKE	I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer	999
	A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch	999
	uncapable of pity, void and empty	999
	From any dram of mercy.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I have heard	999
	Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify	999
	His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate	999
	And that no lawful means can carry me	999
	Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose	999
	My patience to his fury, and am arm'd	999
	To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,	999
	The very tyranny and rage of his.	999
	999
DUKE	Go one, and call the Jew into the court.	999
	999
SALERIO	He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.	999
	999
	[Enter SHYLOCK]	999
	999
DUKE	Make room, and let him stand before our face.	999
	Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,	999
	That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice	999
	To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought	999
	Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange	999
	Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;	999
	And where thou now exact'st the penalty,	999
	Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,	999
	Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,	999
	But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,	999
	Forgive a moiety of the principal;	999
	Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,	999
	That have of late so huddled on his back,	999
	Enow to press a royal merchant down	999
	And pluck commiseration of his state	999
	From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,	999
	From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd	999
	To offices of tender courtesy.	999
	We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;	999
	And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn	999
	To have the due and forfeit of my bond:	999
	If you deny it, let the danger light	999
	Upon your charter and your city's freedom.	999
	You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have	999
	A weight of carrion flesh than to receive	999
	Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:	999
	But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?	999
	What if my house be troubled with a rat	999
	And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats	999
	To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?	999
	Some men there are love not a gaping pig;	999
	Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;	999
	And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,	999
	Cannot contain their urine: for affection,	999
	Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood	999
	Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:	999
	As there is no firm reason to be render'd,	999
	Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;	999
	Why he, a harmless necessary cat;	999
	Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force	999
	Must yield to such inevitable shame	999
	As to offend, himself being offended;	999
	So can I give no reason, nor I will not,	999
	More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing	999
	I bear Antonio, that I follow thus	999
	A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?	999
	999
BASSANIO	This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,	999
	To excuse the current of thy cruelty.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I am not bound to please thee with my answers.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Do all men kill the things they do not love?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Hates any man the thing he would not kill?	999
	999
BASSANIO	Every offence is not a hate at first.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?	999
	999
ANTONIO	I pray you, think you question with the Jew:	999
	You may as well go stand upon the beach	999
	And bid the main flood bate his usual height;	999
	You may as well use question with the wolf	999
	Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;	999
	You may as well forbid the mountain pines	999
	To wag their high tops and to make no noise,	999
	When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;	999
	You may as well do anything most hard,	999
	As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--	999
	His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,	999
	Make no more offers, use no farther means,	999
	But with all brief and plain conveniency	999
	Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.	999
	999
BASSANIO	For thy three thousand ducats here is six.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	What judgment shall I dread, doing	999
	Were in six parts and every part a ducat,	999
	I would not draw them; I would have my bond.	999
	999
DUKE	How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?	999
	You have among you many a purchased slave,	999
	Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,	999
	You use in abject and in slavish parts,	999
	Because you bought them: shall I say to you,	999
	Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?	999
	Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds	999
	Be made as soft as yours and let their palates	999
	Be season'd with such viands? You will answer	999
	'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:	999
	The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,	999
	Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.	999
	If you deny me, fie upon your law!	999
	There is no force in the decrees of Venice.	999
	I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?	999
	999
DUKE	Upon my power I may dismiss this court,	999
	Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,	999
	Whom I have sent for to determine this,	999
	Come here to-day.	999
	999
SALERIO	                  My lord, here stays without	999
	A messenger with letters from the doctor,	999
	New come from Padua.	999
	999
DUKE	Bring us the letter; call the messenger.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!	999
	The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,	999
	Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I am a tainted wether of the flock,	999
	Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit	999
	Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me	999
	You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,	999
	Than to live still and write mine epitaph.	999
	999
	[Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk]	999
	999
DUKE	Came you from Padua, from Bellario?	999
	999
NERISSA	From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.	999
	999
	[Presenting a letter]	999
	999
BASSANIO	Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.	999
	999
GRATIANO	Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,	999
	Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,	999
	No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness	999
	Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.	999
	999
GRATIANO	O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!	999
	And for thy life let justice be accused.	999
	Thou almost makest me waver in my faith	999
	To hold opinion with Pythagoras,	999
	That souls of animals infuse themselves	999
	Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit	999
	Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,	999
	Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,	999
	And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,	999
	Infused itself in thee; for thy desires	999
	Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,	999
	Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:	999
	Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall	999
	To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.	999
	999
DUKE	This letter from Bellario doth commend	999
	A young and learned doctor to our court.	999
	Where is he?	999
	999
NERISSA	                  He attendeth here hard by,	999
	To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.	999
	999
DUKE	With all my heart. Some three or four of you	999
	Go give him courteous conduct to this place.	999
	Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.	999
	999
Clerk	[Reads]	999
	999
	Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of	999
	your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that	999
	your messenger came, in loving visitation was with	999
	me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I	999
	acquainted him with the cause in controversy between	999
	the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er	999
	many books together: he is furnished with my	999
	opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the	999
	greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes	999
	with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's	999
	request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of	999
	years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend	999
	estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so	999
	old a head. I leave him to your gracious	999
	acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his	999
	commendation.	999
	999
DUKE	You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:	999
	And here, I take it, is the doctor come.	999
	999
	[Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws]	999
	999
	Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?	999
	999
PORTIA	I did, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE	                  You are welcome: take your place.	999
	Are you acquainted with the difference	999
	That holds this present question in the court?	999
	999
PORTIA	I am informed thoroughly of the cause.	999
	Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?	999
	999
DUKE	Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.	999
	999
PORTIA	Is your name Shylock?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Shylock is my name.	999
	999
PORTIA	Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;	999
	Yet in such rule that the Venetian law	999
	Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.	999
	You stand within his danger, do you not?	999
	999
ANTONIO	Ay, so he says.	999
	999
PORTIA	                  Do you confess the bond?	999
	999
ANTONIO	I do.	999
	999
PORTIA	    Then must the Jew be merciful.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	On what compulsion must I? tell me that.	999
	999
PORTIA	The quality of mercy is not strain'd,	999
	It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven	999
	Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;	999
	It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:	999
	'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes	999
	The throned monarch better than his crown;	999
	His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,	999
	The attribute to awe and majesty,	999
	Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;	999
	But mercy is above this sceptred sway;	999
	It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,	999
	It is an attribute to God himself;	999
	And earthly power doth then show likest God's	999
	When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,	999
	Though justice be thy plea, consider this,	999
	That, in the course of justice, none of us	999
	Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;	999
	And that same prayer doth teach us all to render	999
	The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much	999
	To mitigate the justice of thy plea;	999
	Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice	999
	Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,	999
	The penalty and forfeit of my bond.	999
	999
PORTIA	Is he not able to discharge the money?	999
	999
BASSANIO	Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;	999
	Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,	999
	I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,	999
	On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:	999
	If this will not suffice, it must appear	999
	That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,	999
	Wrest once the law to your authority:	999
	To do a great right, do a little wrong,	999
	And curb this cruel devil of his will.	999
	999
PORTIA	It must not be; there is no power in Venice	999
	Can alter a decree established:	999
	'Twill be recorded for a precedent,	999
	And many an error by the same example	999
	Will rush into the state: it cannot be.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!	999
	O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!	999
	999
PORTIA	I pray you, let me look upon the bond.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.	999
	999
PORTIA	Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:	999
	Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?	999
	No, not for Venice.	999
	999
PORTIA	Why, this bond is forfeit;	999
	And lawfully by this the Jew may claim	999
	A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off	999
	Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:	999
	Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	When it is paid according to the tenor.	999
	It doth appear you are a worthy judge;	999
	You know the law, your exposition	999
	Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,	999
	Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,	999
	Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear	999
	There is no power in the tongue of man	999
	To alter me: I stay here on my bond.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Most heartily I do beseech the court	999
	To give the judgment.	999
	999
PORTIA	Why then, thus it is:	999
	You must prepare your bosom for his knife.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	O noble judge! O excellent young man!	999
	999
PORTIA	For the intent and purpose of the law	999
	Hath full relation to the penalty,	999
	Which here appeareth due upon the bond.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!	999
	How much more elder art thou than thy looks!	999
	999
PORTIA	Therefore lay bare your bosom.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Ay, his breast:	999
	So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?	999
	'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.	999
	999
PORTIA	It is so. Are there balance here to weigh	999
	The flesh?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	         I have them ready.	999
	999
PORTIA	Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,	999
	To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Is it so nominated in the bond?	999
	999
PORTIA	It is not so express'd: but what of that?	999
	'Twere good you do so much for charity.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.	999
	999
PORTIA	You, merchant, have you any thing to say?	999
	999
ANTONIO	But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.	999
	Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!	999
	Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;	999
	For herein Fortune shows herself more kind	999
	Than is her custom: it is still her use	999
	To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,	999
	To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow	999
	An age of poverty; from which lingering penance	999
	Of such misery doth she cut me off.	999
	Commend me to your honourable wife:	999
	Tell her the process of Antonio's end;	999
	Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;	999
	And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge	999
	Whether Bassanio had not once a love.	999
	Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,	999
	And he repents not that he pays your debt;	999
	For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,	999
	I'll pay it presently with all my heart.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Antonio, I am married to a wife	999
	Which is as dear to me as life itself;	999
	But life itself, my wife, and all the world,	999
	Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:	999
	I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all	999
	Here to this devil, to deliver you.	999
	999
PORTIA	Your wife would give you little thanks for that,	999
	If she were by, to hear you make the offer.	999
	999
GRATIANO	I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:	999
	I would she were in heaven, so she could	999
	Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.	999
	999
NERISSA	'Tis well you offer it behind her back;	999
	The wish would make else an unquiet house.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;	999
	Would any of the stock of Barrabas	999
	Had been her husband rather than a Christian!	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.	999
	999
PORTIA	A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:	999
	The court awards it, and the law doth give it.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Most rightful judge!	999
	999
PORTIA	And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:	999
	The law allows it, and the court awards it.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!	999
	999
PORTIA	Tarry a little; there is something else.	999
	This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;	999
	The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'	999
	Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;	999
	But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed	999
	One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods	999
	Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate	999
	Unto the state of Venice.	999
	999
GRATIANO	O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Is that the law?	999
	999
PORTIA	                  Thyself shalt see the act:	999
	For, as thou urgest justice, be assured	999
	Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.	999
	999
GRATIANO	O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice	999
	And let the Christian go.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Here is the money.	999
	999
PORTIA	Soft!	999
	The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:	999
	He shall have nothing but the penalty.	999
	999
GRATIANO	O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!	999
	999
PORTIA	Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.	999
	Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more	999
	But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more	999
	Or less than a just pound, be it but so much	999
	As makes it light or heavy in the substance,	999
	Or the division of the twentieth part	999
	Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn	999
	But in the estimation of a hair,	999
	Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.	999
	999
GRATIANO	A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!	999
	Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.	999
	999
PORTIA	Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Give me my principal, and let me go.	999
	999
BASSANIO	I have it ready for thee; here it is.	999
	999
PORTIA	He hath refused it in the open court:	999
	He shall have merely justice and his bond.	999
	999
GRATIANO	A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!	999
	I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Shall I not have barely my principal?	999
	999
PORTIA	Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,	999
	To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Why, then the devil give him good of it!	999
	I'll stay no longer question.	999
	999
PORTIA	Tarry, Jew:	999
	The law hath yet another hold on you.	999
	It is enacted in the laws of Venice,	999
	If it be proved against an alien	999
	That by direct or indirect attempts	999
	He seek the life of any citizen,	999
	The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive	999
	Shall seize one half his goods; the other half	999
	Comes to the privy coffer of the state;	999
	And the offender's life lies in the mercy	999
	Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.	999
	In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;	999
	For it appears, by manifest proceeding,	999
	That indirectly and directly too	999
	Thou hast contrived against the very life	999
	Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd	999
	The danger formerly by me rehearsed.	999
	Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.	999
	999
GRATIANO	Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:	999
	And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,	999
	Thou hast not left the value of a cord;	999
	Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.	999
	999
DUKE	That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,	999
	I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:	999
	For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;	999
	The other half comes to the general state,	999
	Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.	999
	999
PORTIA	Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:	999
	You take my house when you do take the prop	999
	That doth sustain my house; you take my life	999
	When you do take the means whereby I live.	999
	999
PORTIA	What mercy can you render him, Antonio?	999
	999
GRATIANO	A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.	999
	999
ANTONIO	So please my lord the duke and all the court	999
	To quit the fine for one half of his goods,	999
	I am content; so he will let me have	999
	The other half in use, to render it,	999
	Upon his death, unto the gentleman	999
	That lately stole his daughter:	999
	Two things provided more, that, for this favour,	999
	He presently become a Christian;	999
	The other, that he do record a gift,	999
	Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,	999
	Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.	999
	999
DUKE	He shall do this, or else I do recant	999
	The pardon that I late pronounced here.	999
	999
PORTIA	Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I am content.	999
	999
PORTIA	                  Clerk, draw a deed of gift.	999
	999
SHYLOCK	I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;	999
	I am not well: send the deed after me,	999
	And I will sign it.	999
	999
DUKE	Get thee gone, but do it.	999
	999
GRATIANO	In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:	999
	Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,	999
	To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.	999
	999
	[Exit SHYLOCK]	999
	999
DUKE	Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.	999
	999
PORTIA	I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:	999
	I must away this night toward Padua,	999
	And it is meet I presently set forth.	999
	999
DUKE	I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.	999
	Antonio, gratify this gentleman,	999
	For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Duke and his train]	999
	999
BASSANIO	Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend	999
	Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted	999
	Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,	999
	Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,	999
	We freely cope your courteous pains withal.	999
	999
ANTONIO	And stand indebted, over and above,	999
	In love and service to you evermore.	999
	999
PORTIA	He is well paid that is well satisfied;	999
	And I, delivering you, am satisfied	999
	And therein do account myself well paid:	999
	My mind was never yet more mercenary.	999
	I pray you, know me when we meet again:	999
	I wish you well, and so I take my leave.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:	999
	Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,	999
	Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,	999
	Not to deny me, and to pardon me.	999
	999
PORTIA	You press me far, and therefore I will yield.	999
	999
	[To ANTONIO]	999
	999
	Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;	999
	999
	[To BASSANIO]	999
	999
	And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:	999
	Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;	999
	And you in love shall not deny me this.	999
	999
BASSANIO	This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!	999
	I will not shame myself to give you this.	999
	999
PORTIA	I will have nothing else but only this;	999
	And now methinks I have a mind to it.	999
	999
BASSANIO	There's more depends on this than on the value.	999
	The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,	999
	And find it out by proclamation:	999
	Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.	999
	999
PORTIA	I see, sir, you are liberal in offers	999
	You taught me first to beg; and now methinks	999
	You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;	999
	And when she put it on, she made me vow	999
	That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.	999
	999
PORTIA	That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.	999
	An if your wife be not a mad-woman,	999
	And know how well I have deserved the ring,	999
	She would not hold out enemy for ever,	999
	For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!	999
	999
	[Exeunt Portia and Nerissa]	999
	999
ANTONIO	My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:	999
	Let his deservings and my love withal	999
	Be valued against your wife's commandment.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;	999
	Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,	999
	Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.	999
	999
	[Exit Gratiano]	999
	999
	Come, you and I will thither presently;	999
	And in the morning early will we both	999
	Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.	999
	999

SCENE II	The same. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PORTIA and NERISSA]	999
	999
PORTIA	Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed	999
	And let him sign it: we'll away to-night	999
	And be a day before our husbands home:	999
	This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.	999
	999
	[Enter GRATIANO]	999
	999
GRATIANO	Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en	999
	My Lord Bassanio upon more advice	999
	Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat	999
	Your company at dinner.	999
	999
PORTIA	That cannot be:	999
	His ring I do accept most thankfully:	999
	And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,	999
	I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.	999
	999
GRATIANO	That will I do.	999
	999
NERISSA	                  Sir, I would speak with you.	999
	999
	[Aside to PORTIA]	999
	999
	I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,	999
	Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.	999
	999
PORTIA	[Aside to NERISSA]  Thou mayst, I warrant.	999
	We shall have old swearing	999
	That they did give the rings away to men;	999
	But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.	999
	999
	[Aloud]	999
	999
	Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.	999
	999
NERISSA	Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?	999

	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE	999

	999
ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Belmont. Avenue to PORTIA'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LORENZO and JESSICA]	999
	999
LORENZO	The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,	999
	When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees	999
	And they did make no noise, in such a night	999
	Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls	999
	And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,	999
	Where Cressid lay that night.	999
	999
JESSICA	In such a night	999
	Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew	999
	And saw the lion's shadow ere himself	999
	And ran dismay'd away.	999
	999
LORENZO	In such a night	999
	Stood Dido with a willow in her hand	999
	Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love	999
	To come again to Carthage.	999
	999
JESSICA	In such a night	999
	Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs	999
	That did renew old AEson.	999
	999
LORENZO	In such a night	999
	Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew	999
	And with an unthrift love did run from Venice	999
	As far as Belmont.	999
	999
JESSICA	                  In such a night	999
	Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,	999
	Stealing her soul with many vows of faith	999
	And ne'er a true one.	999
	999
LORENZO	In such a night	999
	Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,	999
	Slander her love, and he forgave it her.	999
	999
JESSICA	I would out-night you, did no body come;	999
	But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.	999
	999
	[Enter STEPHANO]	999
	999
LORENZO	Who comes so fast in silence of the night?	999
	999
STEPHANO	A friend.	999
	999
LORENZO	A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?	999
	999
STEPHANO	Stephano is my name; and I bring word	999
	My mistress will before the break of day	999
	Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about	999
	By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays	999
	For happy wedlock hours.	999
	999
LORENZO	Who comes with her?	999
	999
STEPHANO	None but a holy hermit and her maid.	999
	I pray you, is my master yet return'd?	999
	999
LORENZO	He is not, nor we have not heard from him.	999
	But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,	999
	And ceremoniously let us prepare	999
	Some welcome for the mistress of the house.	999
	999
	[Enter LAUNCELOT]	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!	999
	999
LORENZO	Who calls?	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?	999
	Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!	999
	999
LORENZO	Leave hollaing, man: here.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Sola! where? where?	999
	999
LORENZO	Here.	999
	999
LAUNCELOT	Tell him there's a post come from my master, with	999
	his horn full of good news: my master will be here	999
	ere morning.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LORENZO	Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.	999
	And yet no matter: why should we go in?	999
	My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,	999
	Within the house, your mistress is at hand;	999
	And bring your music forth into the air.	999
	999
	[Exit Stephano]	999
	999
	How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!	999
	Here will we sit and let the sounds of music	999
	Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night	999
	Become the touches of sweet harmony.	999
	Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven	999
	Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:	999
	There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st	999
	But in his motion like an angel sings,	999
	Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;	999
	Such harmony is in immortal souls;	999
	But whilst this muddy vesture of decay	999
	Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.	999
	999
	[Enter Musicians]	999
	999
	Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!	999
	With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,	999
	And draw her home with music.	999
	999
	[Music]	999
	999
JESSICA	I am never merry when I hear sweet music.	999
	999
LORENZO	The reason is, your spirits are attentive:	999
	For do but note a wild and wanton herd,	999
	Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,	999
	Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,	999
	Which is the hot condition of their blood;	999
	If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,	999
	Or any air of music touch their ears,	999
	You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,	999
	Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze	999
	By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet	999
	Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;	999
	Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,	999
	But music for the time doth change his nature.	999
	The man that hath no music in himself,	999
	Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,	999
	Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;	999
	The motions of his spirit are dull as night	999
	And his affections dark as Erebus:	999
	Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.	999
	999
	[Enter PORTIA and NERISSA]	999
	999
PORTIA	That light we see is burning in my hall.	999
	How far that little candle throws his beams!	999
	So shines a good deed in a naughty world.	999
	999
NERISSA	When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.	999
	999
PORTIA	So doth the greater glory dim the less:	999
	A substitute shines brightly as a king	999
	Unto the king be by, and then his state	999
	Empties itself, as doth an inland brook	999
	Into the main of waters. Music! hark!	999
	999
NERISSA	It is your music, madam, of the house.	999
	999
PORTIA	Nothing is good, I see, without respect:	999
	Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.	999
	999
NERISSA	Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.	999
	999
PORTIA	The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,	999
	When neither is attended, and I think	999
	The nightingale, if she should sing by day,	999
	When every goose is cackling, would be thought	999
	No better a musician than the wren.	999
	How many things by season season'd are	999
	To their right praise and true perfection!	999
	Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion	999
	And would not be awaked.	999
	999
	[Music ceases]	999
	999
LORENZO	That is the voice,	999
	Or I am much deceived, of Portia.	999
	999
PORTIA	He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,	999
	By the bad voice.	999
	999
LORENZO	                  Dear lady, welcome home.	999
	999
PORTIA	We have been praying for our husbands' healths,	999
	Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.	999
	Are they return'd?	999
	999
LORENZO	                  Madam, they are not yet;	999
	But there is come a messenger before,	999
	To signify their coming.	999
	999
PORTIA	Go in, Nerissa;	999
	Give order to my servants that they take	999
	No note at all of our being absent hence;	999
	Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.	999
	999
	[A tucket sounds]	999
	999
LORENZO	Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:	999
	We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.	999
	999
PORTIA	This night methinks is but the daylight sick;	999
	It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,	999
	Such as the day is when the sun is hid.	999
	999
	[Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and	999
	their followers]	999
	999
BASSANIO	We should hold day with the Antipodes,	999
	If you would walk in absence of the sun.	999
	999
PORTIA	Let me give light, but let me not be light;	999
	For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,	999
	And never be Bassanio so for me:	999
	But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.	999
	999
BASSANIO	I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.	999
	This is the man, this is Antonio,	999
	To whom I am so infinitely bound.	999
	999
PORTIA	You should in all sense be much bound to him.	999
	For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.	999
	999
ANTONIO	No more than I am well acquitted of.	999
	999
PORTIA	Sir, you are very welcome to our house:	999
	It must appear in other ways than words,	999
	Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.	999
	999
GRATIANO	[To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;	999
	In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:	999
	Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,	999
	Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.	999
	999
PORTIA	A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?	999
	999
GRATIANO	About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring	999
	That she did give me, whose posy was	999
	For all the world like cutler's poetry	999
	Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'	999
	999
NERISSA	What talk you of the posy or the value?	999
	You swore to me, when I did give it you,	999
	That you would wear it till your hour of death	999
	And that it should lie with you in your grave:	999
	Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,	999
	You should have been respective and have kept it.	999
	Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,	999
	The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.	999
	999
GRATIANO	He will, an if he live to be a man.	999
	999
NERISSA	Ay, if a woman live to be a man.	999
	999
GRATIANO	Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,	999
	A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,	999
	No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,	999
	A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:	999
	I could not for my heart deny it him.	999
	999
PORTIA	You were to blame, I must be plain with you,	999
	To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:	999
	A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger	999
	And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.	999
	I gave my love a ring and made him swear	999
	Never to part with it; and here he stands;	999
	I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it	999
	Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth	999
	That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,	999
	You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:	999
	An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.	999
	999
BASSANIO	[Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off	999
	And swear I lost the ring defending it.	999
	999
GRATIANO	My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away	999
	Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed	999
	Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,	999
	That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;	999
	And neither man nor master would take aught	999
	But the two rings.	999
	999
PORTIA	What ring gave you my lord?	999
	Not that, I hope, which you received of me.	999
	999
BASSANIO	If I could add a lie unto a fault,	999
	I would deny it; but you see my finger	999
	Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.	999
	999
PORTIA	Even so void is your false heart of truth.	999
	By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed	999
	Until I see the ring.	999
	999
NERISSA	Nor I in yours	999
	Till I again see mine.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Sweet Portia,	999
	If you did know to whom I gave the ring,	999
	If you did know for whom I gave the ring	999
	And would conceive for what I gave the ring	999
	And how unwillingly I left the ring,	999
	When nought would be accepted but the ring,	999
	You would abate the strength of your displeasure.	999
	999
PORTIA	If you had known the virtue of the ring,	999
	Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,	999
	Or your own honour to contain the ring,	999
	You would not then have parted with the ring.	999
	What man is there so much unreasonable,	999
	If you had pleased to have defended it	999
	With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty	999
	To urge the thing held as a ceremony?	999
	Nerissa teaches me what to believe:	999
	I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.	999
	999
BASSANIO	No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,	999
	No woman had it, but a civil doctor,	999
	Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me	999
	And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him	999
	And suffer'd him to go displeased away;	999
	Even he that did uphold the very life	999
	Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?	999
	I was enforced to send it after him;	999
	I was beset with shame and courtesy;	999
	My honour would not let ingratitude	999
	So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;	999
	For, by these blessed candles of the night,	999
	Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd	999
	The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.	999
	999
PORTIA	Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:	999
	Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,	999
	And that which you did swear to keep for me,	999
	I will become as liberal as you;	999
	I'll not deny him any thing I have,	999
	No, not my body nor my husband's bed:	999
	Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:	999
	Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:	999
	If you do not, if I be left alone,	999
	Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,	999
	I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.	999
	999
NERISSA	And I his clerk; therefore be well advised	999
	How you do leave me to mine own protection.	999
	999
GRATIANO	Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;	999
	For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.	999
	999
PORTIA	Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;	999
	And, in the hearing of these many friends,	999
	I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,	999
	Wherein I see myself--	999
	999
PORTIA	Mark you but that!	999
	In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;	999
	In each eye, one: swear by your double self,	999
	And there's an oath of credit.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Nay, but hear me:	999
	Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear	999
	I never more will break an oath with thee.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I once did lend my body for his wealth;	999
	Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,	999
	Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,	999
	My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord	999
	Will never more break faith advisedly.	999
	999
PORTIA	Then you shall be his surety. Give him this	999
	And bid him keep it better than the other.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.	999
	999
BASSANIO	By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!	999
	999
PORTIA	I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;	999
	For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.	999
	999
NERISSA	And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;	999
	For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,	999
	In lieu of this last night did lie with me.	999
	999
GRATIANO	Why, this is like the mending of highways	999
	In summer, where the ways are fair enough:	999
	What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?	999
	999
PORTIA	Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:	999
	Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;	999
	It comes from Padua, from Bellario:	999
	There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,	999
	Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here	999
	Shall witness I set forth as soon as you	999
	And even but now return'd; I have not yet	999
	Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;	999
	And I have better news in store for you	999
	Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;	999
	There you shall find three of your argosies	999
	Are richly come to harbour suddenly:	999
	You shall not know by what strange accident	999
	I chanced on this letter.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I am dumb.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Were you the doctor and I knew you not?	999
	999
GRATIANO	Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?	999
	999
NERISSA	Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,	999
	Unless he live until he be a man.	999
	999
BASSANIO	Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:	999
	When I am absent, then lie with my wife.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;	999
	For here I read for certain that my ships	999
	Are safely come to road.	999
	999
PORTIA	How now, Lorenzo!	999
	My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.	999
	999
NERISSA	Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.	999
	There do I give to you and Jessica,	999
	From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,	999
	After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.	999
	999
LORENZO	Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way	999
	Of starved people.	999
	999
PORTIA	                  It is almost morning,	999
	And yet I am sure you are not satisfied	999
	Of these events at full. Let us go in;	999
	And charge us there upon inter'gatories,	999
	And we will answer all things faithfully.	999
	999
GRATIANO	Let it be so: the first inter'gatory	999
	That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,	999
	Whether till the next night she had rather stay,	999
	Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:	999
	But were the day come, I should wish it dark,	999
	That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.	999
	Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing	999
	So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.	999

	999
	[Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS]	999
	999
SHALLOW	Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star-	999
	chamber matter of it: if he were twenty Sir John	999
	Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.	999
	999
SLENDER	In the county of Gloucester, justice of peace and	999
	'Coram.'	999
	999
SHALLOW	Ay, cousin Slender, and 'Custalourum.	999
	999
SLENDER	Ay, and 'Rato-lorum' too; and a gentleman born,	999
	master parson; who writes himself 'Armigero,' in any	999
	bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, 'Armigero.'	999
	999
SHALLOW	Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three	999
	hundred years.	999
	999
SLENDER	All his successors gone before him hath done't; and	999
	all his ancestors that come after him may: they may	999
	give the dozen white luces in their coat.	999
	999
SHALLOW	It is an old coat.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;	999
	it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to	999
	man, and signifies love.	999
	999
SHALLOW	The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.	999
	999
SLENDER	I may quarter, coz.	999
	999
SHALLOW	You may, by marrying.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Not a whit.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Yes, py'r lady; if he has a quarter of your coat,	999
	there is but three skirts for yourself, in my	999
	simple conjectures: but that is all one. If Sir	999
	John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto	999
	you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my	999
	benevolence to make atonements and compremises	999
	between you.	999
	999
SHALLOW	The council shall bear it; it is a riot.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	It is not meet the council hear a riot; there is no	999
	fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall	999
	desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a	999
	riot; take your vizaments in that.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword	999
	should end it.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it:	999
	and there is also another device in my prain, which	999
	peradventure prings goot discretions with it: there	999
	is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas	999
	Page, which is pretty virginity.	999
	999
SLENDER	Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks	999
	small like a woman.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as	999
	you will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys,	999
	and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his	999
	death's-bed--Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!	999
	--give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years	999
	old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles	999
	and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master	999
	Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.	999
	999
SLENDER	Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.	999
	999
SLENDER	I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is goot gifts.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do	999
	despise one that is false, or as I despise one that	999
	is not true. The knight, Sir John, is there; and, I	999
	beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers. I will	999
	peat the door for Master Page.	999

	999
PAGE	[Within]  Who's there?	999
	999
	[Enter PAGE]	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Here is Got's plessing, and your friend, and Justice	999
	Shallow; and here young Master Slender, that	999
	peradventures shall tell you another tale, if	999
	matters grow to your likings.	999
	999
PAGE	I am glad to see your worships well.	999
	I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do it	999
	your good heart! I wished your venison better; it	999
	was ill killed. How doth good Mistress Page?--and I	999
	thank you always with my heart, la! with my heart.	999
	999
PAGE	Sir, I thank you.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.	999
	999
PAGE	I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.	999
	999
SLENDER	How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he	999
	was outrun on Cotsall.	999
	999
PAGE	It could not be judged, sir.	999
	999
SLENDER	You'll not confess, you'll not confess.	999
	999
SHALLOW	That he will not. 'Tis your fault, 'tis your fault;	999
	'tis a good dog.	999
	999
PAGE	A cur, sir.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog: can there be	999
	more said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John	999
	Falstaff here?	999
	999
PAGE	Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good	999
	office between you.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.	999
	999
SHALLOW	He hath wronged me, Master Page.	999
	999
PAGE	Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.	999
	999
SHALLOW	If it be confessed, it is not redress'd: is not that	999
	so, Master Page? He hath wronged me; indeed he	999
	hath, at a word, he hath, believe me: Robert	999
	Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.	999
	999
PAGE	Here comes Sir John.	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, NYM, and PISTOL]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?	999
	999
SHALLOW	Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and	999
	broke open my lodge.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	But not kissed your keeper's daughter?	999
	999
SHALLOW	Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I will answer it straight; I have done all this.	999
	That is now answered.	999
	999
SHALLOW	The council shall know this.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:	999
	you'll be laughed at.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your	999
	head: what matter have you against me?	999
	999
SLENDER	Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;	999
	and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,	999
	Nym, and Pistol.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	You Banbury cheese!	999
	999
SLENDER	Ay, it is no matter.	999
	999
PISTOL	How now, Mephostophilus!	999
	999
SLENDER	Ay, it is no matter.	999
	999
NYM	Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that's my humour.	999
	999
SLENDER	Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is	999
	three umpires in this matter, as I understand; that	999
	is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is	999
	myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,	999
	lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.	999
	999
PAGE	We three, to hear it and end it between them.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-	999
	book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with	999
	as great discreetly as we can.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Pistol!	999
	999
PISTOL	He hears with ears.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He	999
	hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?	999
	999
SLENDER	Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might	999
	never come in mine own great chamber again else, of	999
	seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward	999
	shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two	999
	pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Is this true, Pistol?	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.	999
	999
PISTOL	Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,	999
	I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.	999
	Word of denial in thy labras here!	999
	Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!	999
	999
SLENDER	By these gloves, then, 'twas he.	999
	999
NYM	Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say	999
	'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's	999
	humour on me; that is the very note of it.	999
	999
SLENDER	By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for	999
	though I cannot remember what I did when you made me	999
	drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What say you, Scarlet and John?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk	999
	himself out of his five sentences.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!	999
	999
BARDOLPH	And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and	999
	so conclusions passed the careires.	999
	999
SLENDER	Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no	999
	matter: I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,	999
	but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:	999
	if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have	999
	the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.	999
	999
	[Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine; MISTRESS FORD	999
	and MISTRESS PAGE, following]	999
	999
PAGE	Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.	999
	999
	[Exit ANNE PAGE]	999
	999
SLENDER	O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.	999
	999
PAGE	How now, Mistress Ford!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met:	999
	by your leave, good mistress.	999
	999
	[Kisses her]	999
	999
PAGE	Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a	999
	hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope	999
	we shall drink down all unkindness.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all except SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS]	999
	999
SLENDER	I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of	999
	Songs and Sonnets here.	999
	999
	[Enter SIMPLE]	999
	999
	How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait	999
	on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles	999
	about you, have you?	999
	999
SIMPLE	Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice	999
	Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight	999
	afore Michaelmas?	999
	999
SHALLOW	Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with	999
	you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a	999
	tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh	999
	here. Do you understand me?	999
	999
SLENDER	Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so,	999
	I shall do that that is reason.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Nay, but understand me.	999
	999
SLENDER	So I do, sir.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will	999
	description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.	999
	999
SLENDER	Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray	999
	you, pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his	999
	country, simple though I stand here.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	But that is not the question: the question is	999
	concerning your marriage.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Ay, there's the point, sir.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.	999
	999
SLENDER	Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any	999
	reasonable demands.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to	999
	know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers	999
	philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the	999
	mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your	999
	good will to the maid?	999
	999
SHALLOW	Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?	999
	999
SLENDER	I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that	999
	would do reason.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak	999
	possitable, if you can carry her your desires	999
	towards her.	999
	999
SHALLOW	That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?	999
	999
SLENDER	I will do a greater thing than that, upon your	999
	request, cousin, in any reason.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do	999
	is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?	999
	999
SLENDER	I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there	999
	be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may	999
	decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are	999
	married and have more occasion to know one another;	999
	I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:	999
	but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that	999
	I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in	999
	the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our	999
	meaning, 'resolutely:' his meaning is good.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Ay, I think my cousin meant well.	999
	999
SLENDER	Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!	999
	999
SHALLOW	Here comes fair Mistress Anne.	999
	999
	[Re-enter ANNE PAGE]	999
	999
	Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	The dinner is on the table; my father desires your	999
	worships' company.	999
	999
SHALLOW	I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.	999
	999
	[Exeunt SHALLOW and SIR HUGH EVANS]	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	Will't please your worship to come in, sir?	999
	999
SLENDER	No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	The dinner attends you, sir.	999
	999
SLENDER	I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,	999
	sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my	999
	cousin Shallow.	999
	999
	[Exit SIMPLE]	999
	999
	A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his	999
	friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy	999
	yet, till my mother be dead: but what though? Yet I	999
	live like a poor gentleman born.	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	I may not go in without your worship: they will not	999
	sit till you come.	999
	999
SLENDER	I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as	999
	though I did.	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	I pray you, sir, walk in.	999
	999
SLENDER	I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised	999
	my shin th' other day with playing at sword and	999
	dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a	999
	dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot	999
	abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your	999
	dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.	999
	999
SLENDER	I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at	999
	it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see	999
	the bear loose, are you not?	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	Ay, indeed, sir.	999
	999
SLENDER	That's meat and drink to me, now. I have seen	999
	Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by	999
	the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so	999
	cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,	999
	indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favored	999
	rough things.	999
	999
	[Re-enter PAGE]	999
	999
PAGE	Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.	999
	999
SLENDER	I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.	999
	999
PAGE	By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come, come.	999
	999
SLENDER	Nay, pray you, lead the way.	999
	999
PAGE	Come on, sir.	999
	999
SLENDER	Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.	999
	999
SLENDER	I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.	999
	You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!	999

SIR HUGH EVANS	Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house which	999

	which is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry	999
	nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer, and	999
	his wringer.	999
	999
SIMPLE	Well, sir.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for it	999
	is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance with	999
	Mistress Anne Page: and the letter is, to desire	999
	and require her to solicit your master's desires to	999
	Mistress Anne Page. I pray you, be gone: I will	999

	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF, Host, BARDOLPH, NYM, PISTOL,	999
	and ROBIN]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Mine host of the Garter!	999
	999
Host	What says my bully-rook? speak scholarly and wisely.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my	999
	followers.	999
	999
Host	Discard, bully Hercules; cashier: let them wag; trot, trot.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I sit at ten pounds a week.	999
	999
Host	Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar. I	999
	will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall	999
	tap: said I well, bully Hector?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Do so, good mine host.	999
	999
Host	I have spoke; let him follow.	999
	999
	[To BARDOLPH]	999
	999
	Let me see thee froth and lime: I am at a word; follow.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade:	999
	an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered	999
	serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.	999
	999
PISTOL	O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot wield?	999
	999
	[Exit BARDOLPH]	999
	999
NYM	He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox: his	999
	thefts were too open; his filching was like an	999
	unskilful singer; he kept not time.	999
	999
NYM	The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.	999
	999
PISTOL	'Convey,' the wise it call. 'Steal!' foh! a fico	999
	for the phrase!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.	999
	999
PISTOL	Why, then, let kibes ensue.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must shift.	999
	999
PISTOL	Young ravens must have food.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Which of you know Ford of this town?	999
	999
PISTOL	I ken the wight: he is of substance good.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.	999
	999
PISTOL	Two yards, and more.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two	999
	yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about	999
	thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's	999
	wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,	999
	she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I	999
	can construe the action of her familiar style; and	999
	the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished	999
	rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'	999
	999
PISTOL	He hath studied her will, and translated her will,	999
	out of honesty into English.	999
	999
NYM	The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her	999
	husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.	999
	999
PISTOL	As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.	999
	999
NYM	The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I have writ me here a letter to her: and here	999
	another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good	999
	eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious	999
	oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my	999
	foot, sometimes my portly belly.	999
	999
PISTOL	Then did the sun on dunghill shine.	999
	999
NYM	I thank thee for that humour.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a	999
	greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did	999
	seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's	999
	another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she	999
	is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will	999
	be cheater to them both, and they shall be	999
	exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West	999
	Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou	999
	this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to	999
	Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.	999
	999
PISTOL	Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,	999
	And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!	999
	999
NYM	I will run no base humour: here, take the	999
	humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	[To ROBIN]  Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;	999
	Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.	999
	Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;	999
	Trudge, plod away o' the hoof; seek shelter, pack!	999
	Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,	999
	French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.	999
	999
	[Exeunt FALSTAFF and ROBIN]	999
	999
PISTOL	Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam holds,	999
	And high and low beguiles the rich and poor:	999
	Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,	999
	Base Phrygian Turk!	999
	999
NYM	I have operations which be humours of revenge.	999
	999
PISTOL	Wilt thou revenge?	999
	999
NYM	By welkin and her star!	999
	999
PISTOL	With wit or steel?	999
	999
NYM	With both the humours, I:	999
	I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.	999
	999
PISTOL	     And I to Ford shall eke unfold	999
	How Falstaff, varlet vile,	999
	His dove will prove, his gold will hold,	999
	And his soft couch defile.	999
	999
NYM	My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to	999
	deal with poison; I will possess him with	999
	yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous:	999
	that is my true humour.	999
	999
PISTOL	Thou art the Mars of malecontents: I second thee; troop on.	999

	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	What, John Rugby! I pray thee, go to the casement,	999
	and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor	999
	Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find any	999
	body in the house, here will be an old abusing of	999
	God's patience and the king's English.	999
	999
RUGBY	I'll go watch.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in	999
	faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.	999
	999
	[Exit RUGBY]	999
	999
	An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant	999
	shall come in house withal, and, I warrant you, no	999
	tell-tale nor no breed-bate: his worst fault is,	999
	that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish	999
	that way: but nobody but has his fault; but let	999
	that pass. Peter Simple, you say your name is?	999
	999
SIMPLE	Ay, for fault of a better.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	And Master Slender's your master?	999
	999
SIMPLE	Ay, forsooth.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Does he not wear a great round beard, like a	999
	glover's paring-knife?	999
	999
SIMPLE	No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with a	999
	little yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	A softly-sprighted man, is he not?	999
	999
SIMPLE	Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his hands	999
	as any is between this and his head; he hath fought	999
	with a warrener.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	How say you? O, I should remember him: does he not	999
	hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?	999
	999
SIMPLE	Yes, indeed, does he.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell	999
	Master Parson Evans I will do what I can for your	999
	master: Anne is a good girl, and I wish--	999
	999
	[Re-enter RUGBY]	999
	999
RUGBY	Out, alas! here comes my master.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	We shall all be shent. Run in here, good young man;	999
	go into this closet: he will not stay long.	999
	999
	[Shuts SIMPLE in the closet]	999
	999
	What, John Rugby! John! what, John, I say!	999
	Go, John, go inquire for my master; I doubt	999
	he be not well, that he comes not home.	999
	999
	[Singing]	999
	999
	And down, down, adown-a, &c.	999

	[Enter DOCTOR CAIUS]	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys. Pray you,	999
	go and vetch me in my closet un boitier vert, a box,	999
	a green-a box: do intend vat I speak? a green-a box.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Ay, forsooth; I'll fetch it you.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	I am glad he went not in himself: if he had found	999
	the young man, he would have been horn-mad.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Fe, fe, fe, fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je	999
	m'en vais a la cour--la grande affaire.	999

RUGBY	Here, sir!	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby. Come,	999
	take-a your rapier, and come after my heel to the court.	999
	999
RUGBY	'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	By my trot, I tarry too long. Od's me!	999
	Qu'ai-j'oublie! dere is some simples in my closet,	999
	dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Ay me, he'll find the young man here, and be mad!	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	O diable, diable! vat is in my closet? Villain! larron!	999
	999
	[Pulling SIMPLE out]	999
	999
	Rugby, my rapier!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Good master, be content.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Wherefore shall I be content-a?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	The young man is an honest man.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	What shall de honest man do in my closet? dere is	999
	no honest man dat shall come in my closet.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the truth	999
	of it: he came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Vell.	999
	999
SIMPLE	Ay, forsooth; to desire her to--	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Peace, I pray you.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.	999
	999
SIMPLE	To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to	999
	speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my	999
	master in the way of marriage.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	This is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my	999
	finger in the fire, and need not.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baille me some paper.	999
	Tarry you a little-a while.	999
	999
	[Writes]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	[Aside to SIMPLE]  I am glad he is so quiet: if he	999
	had been thoroughly moved, you should have heard him	999
	so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding,	999
	man, I'll do you your master what good I can: and	999
	the very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my	999
	master,--I may call him my master, look you, for I	999
	keep his house; and I wash, wring, brew, bake,	999
	scour, dress meat and drink, make the beds and do	999
	all myself,--	999
	999
SIMPLE	[Aside to MISTRESS QUICKLY]  'Tis a great charge to	999
	come under one body's hand.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	[Aside to SIMPLE]  Are you avised o' that? you	999
	shall find it a great charge: and to be up early	999
	and down late; but notwithstanding,--to tell you in	999
	your ear; I would have no words of it,--my master	999
	himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page: but	999
	notwithstanding that, I know Anne's mind,--that's	999
	neither here nor there.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	You jack'nape, give-a this letter to Sir Hugh; by	999
	gar, it is a shallenge: I will cut his troat in dee	999
	park; and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest	999
	to meddle or make. You may be gone; it is not good	999
	you tarry here. By gar, I will cut all his two	999
	stones; by gar, he shall not have a stone to throw	999
	at his dog:	999
	999
	[Exit SIMPLE]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Alas, he speaks but for his friend.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	It is no matter-a ver dat: do not you tell-a me	999
	dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I	999
	vill kill de Jack priest; and I have appointed mine	999
	host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar, I	999
	will myself have Anne Page.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We	999
	must give folks leave to prate: what, the good-jer!	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if I have	999
	not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my	999
	door. Follow my heels, Rugby.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DOCTOR CAIUS and RUGBY]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	You shall have An fool's-head of your own. No, I	999
	know Anne's mind for that: never a woman in Windsor	999
	knows more of Anne's mind than I do; nor can do more	999
	than I do with her, I thank heaven.	999
	999
FENTON	[Within]  Who's within there? ho!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Who's there, I trow! Come near the house, I pray you.	999
	999
	[Enter FENTON]	999
	999
FENTON	How now, good woman? how dost thou?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	The better that it pleases your good worship to ask.	999
	999
FENTON	What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and	999
	gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you	999
	that by the way; I praise heaven for it.	999
	999
FENTON	Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? shall I not lose my suit?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but	999
	notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a	999
	book, she loves you. Have not your worship a wart	999
	above your eye?	999
	999
FENTON	Yes, marry, have I; what of that?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Well, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such	999
	another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever	999
	broke bread: we had an hour's talk of that wart. I	999
	shall never laugh but in that maid's company! But	999
	indeed she is given too much to allicholy and	999
	musing: but for you--well, go to.	999
	999
FENTON	Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money	999
	for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf: if	999
	thou seest her before me, commend me.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Will I? i'faith, that we will; and I will tell your	999
	worship more of the wart the next time we have	999
	confidence; and of other wooers.	999
	999
FENTON	Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Farewell to your worship.	999
	999
	[Exit FENTON]	999
	999
	Truly, an honest gentleman: but Anne loves him not;	999
	for I know Anne's mind as well as another does. Out	999
	upon't! what have I forgot?	999
	999

	THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	999
	999
	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Before PAGE'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter MISTRESS PAGE, with a letter]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-	999
	time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?	999
	Let me see.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though	999
	Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him	999
	not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more	999
	am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry,	999
	so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you	999
	love sack, and so do I; would you desire better	999
	sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,--at	999
	the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,--	999
	that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis	999
	not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,	999
	Thine own true knight,	999
	By day or night,	999
	Or any kind of light,	999
	With all his might	999
	For thee to fight,    JOHN FALSTAFF'	999
	What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked	999
	world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with	999
	age to show himself a young gallant! What an	999
	unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard	999
	picked--with the devil's name!--out of my	999
	conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?	999
	Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What	999
	should I say to him? I was then frugal of my	999
	mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill	999
	in the parliament for the putting down of men. How	999
	shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,	999
	as sure as his guts are made of puddings.	999
	999
	[Enter MISTRESS FORD]	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very	999
	ill.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Faith, but you do, in my mind.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the	999
	contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	What's the matter, woman?	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I	999
	could come to such honour!	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is	999
	it? dispense with trifles; what is it?	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,	999
	I could be knighted.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights	999
	will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the	999
	article of thy gentry.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I	999
	might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat	999
	men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of	999
	men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised	999
	women's modesty; and gave such orderly and	999
	well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I	999
	would have sworn his disposition would have gone to	999
	the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere	999
	and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to	999
	the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,	999
	threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his	999
	belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged	999
	on him? I think the best way were to entertain him	999
	with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted	999
	him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and	999
	Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery	999
	of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy	999
	letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I	999
	protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a	999
	thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for	999
	different names--sure, more,--and these are of the	999
	second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;	999
	for he cares not what he puts into the press, when	999
	he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,	999
	and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you	999
	twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very	999
	words. What doth he think of us?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to	999
	wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain	999
	myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;	999
	for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I	999
	know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him	999
	above deck.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	So will I	if he come under my hatches, I'll never	999
	to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's	999
	appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in	999
	his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,	999
	till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,	999
	that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,	999
	that my husband saw this letter! it would give	999
	eternal food to his jealousy.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he's	999
	as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;	999
	and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	You are the happier woman.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Let's consult together against this greasy knight.	999
	Come hither.	999
	999
	[They retire]	999
	999
	[Enter FORD with PISTOL, and PAGE with NYM]	999
	999
FORD	Well, I hope it be not so.	999
	999
PISTOL	Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:	999
	Sir John affects thy wife.	999
	999
FORD	Why, sir, my wife is not young.	999
	999
PISTOL	He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,	999
	Both young and old, one with another, Ford;	999
	He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.	999
	999
FORD	Love my wife!	999
	999
PISTOL	With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,	999
	Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels:	999
	O, odious is the name!	999
	999
FORD	What name, sir?	999
	999
PISTOL	The horn, I say. Farewell.	999
	Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night:	999
	Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.	999
	Away, Sir Corporal Nym!	999
	Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FORD	[Aside]  I will be patient; I will find out this.	999
	999
NYM	[To PAGE]  And this is true; I like not the humour	999
	of lying. He hath wronged me in some humours: I	999
	should have borne the humoured letter to her; but I	999
	have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity.	999
	He loves your wife; there's the short and the long.	999
	My name is Corporal Nym; I speak and I avouch; 'tis	999
	true: my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife.	999
	Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese,	999
	and there's the humour of it. Adieu.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PAGE	'The humour of it,' quoth a'! here's a fellow	999
	frights English out of his wits.	999
	999
FORD	I will seek out Falstaff.	999
	999
PAGE	I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.	999
	999
FORD	If I do find it: well.	999
	999
PAGE	I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest	999
	o' the town commended him for a true man.	999
	999
FORD	'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.	999
	999
PAGE	How now, Meg!	999
	999
	[MISTRESS PAGE and MISTRESS FORD come forward]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Whither go you, George? Hark you.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	How now, sweet Frank! why art thou melancholy?	999
	999
FORD	I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Now,	999
	will you go, Mistress Page?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Have with you. You'll come to dinner, George.	999
	999
	[Aside to MISTRESS FORD]	999
	999
	Look who comes yonder: she shall be our messenger	999
	to this paltry knight.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	[Aside to MISTRESS PAGE]  Trust me, I thought on her:	999
	she'll fit it.	999
	999
	[Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	You are come to see my daughter Anne?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Go in with us and see: we have an hour's talk with	999
	you.	999
	999
	[Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and MISTRESS QUICKLY]	999
	999
PAGE	How now, Master Ford!	999
	999
FORD	You heard what this knave told me, did you not?	999
	999
PAGE	Yes: and you heard what the other told me?	999
	999
FORD	Do you think there is truth in them?	999
	999
PAGE	Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would	999
	offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent	999
	towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men;	999
	very rogues, now they be out of service.	999
	999
FORD	Were they his men?	999
	999
PAGE	Marry, were they.	999
	999
FORD	I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at	999
	the Garter?	999
	999
PAGE	Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage	999
	towards my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and	999
	what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it	999
	lie on my head.	999
	999
FORD	I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to	999
	turn them together. A man may be too confident: I	999
	would have nothing lie on my head: I cannot be thus satisfied.	999
	999
PAGE	Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes:	999
	there is either liquor in his pate or money in his	999
	purse when he looks so merrily.	999
	999
	[Enter Host]	999
	999
	How now, mine host!	999
	999
Host	How now, bully-rook! thou'rt a gentleman.	999
	Cavaleiro-justice, I say!	999
	999
	[Enter SHALLOW]	999
	999
SHALLOW	I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and	999
	twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go	999
	with us? we have sport in hand.	999
	999
Host	Tell him, cavaleiro-justice; tell him, bully-rook.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh	999
	the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.	999
	999
FORD	Good mine host o' the Garter, a word with you.	999
	999
	[Drawing him aside]	999
	999
Host	What sayest thou, my bully-rook?	999
	999
SHALLOW	[To PAGE]  Will you go with us to behold it? My	999
	merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons;	999
	and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places;	999
	for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester.	999
	Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.	999
	999
	[They converse apart]	999
	999
Host	Hast thou no suit against my knight, my	999
	guest-cavaleire?	999
	999
FORD	None, I protest: but I'll give you a pottle of	999
	burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him	999
	my name is Brook; only for a jest.	999
	999
Host	My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress;	999
	--said I well?--and thy name shall be Brook. It is	999
	a merry knight. Will you go, An-heires?	999
	999
SHALLOW	Have with you, mine host.	999
	999
PAGE	I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in	999
	his rapier.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times	999
	you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and	999
	I know not what: 'tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis	999
	here, 'tis here. I have seen the time, with my long	999
	sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.	999
	999
Host	Here, boys, here, here! shall we wag?	999
	999
PAGE	Have with you. I would rather hear them scold than fight.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Host, SHALLOW, and PAGE]	999
	999
FORD	Though Page be a secure fool, an stands so firmly	999
	on his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my	999
	opinion so easily: she was in his company at Page's	999
	house; and what they made there, I know not. Well,	999
	I will look further into't: and I have a disguise	999
	to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not	999
	my labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis labour well bestowed.	999

ACT II	999

	999
	999
SCENE II	A room in the Garter Inn.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF and PISTOL]	999
	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I will not lend thee a penny.	999
	999
PISTOL	Why, then the world's mine oyster.	999
	Which I with sword will open.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should	999
	lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my	999
	good friends for three reprieves for you and your	999
	coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through	999
	the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in	999
	hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were	999
	good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress	999
	Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon	999
	mine honour thou hadst it not.	999
	999
PISTOL	Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll	999
	endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more	999
	about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife	999
	and a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.	999
	You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue! you	999
	stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable	999
	baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the	999
	terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself	999
	sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand	999
	and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to	999
	shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,	999
	will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain	999
	looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your	999
	bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your	999
	honour! You will not do it, you!	999
	999
PISTOL	I do relent: what would thou more of man?	999
	999
	[Enter ROBIN]	999
	999
ROBIN	Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Let her approach.	999
	999
	[Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Give your worship good morrow.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Good morrow, good wife.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Not so, an't please your worship.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Good maid, then.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	I'll be sworn,	999
	As my mother was, the first hour I was born.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I do believe the swearer. What with me?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe thee	999
	the hearing.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	There is one Mistress Ford, sir:--I pray, come a	999
	little nearer this ways:--I myself dwell with master	999
	Doctor Caius,--	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Your worship says very true: I pray your worship,	999
	come a little nearer this ways.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mine	999
	own people.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Are they so? God bless them and make them his servants!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord Lord! your	999
	worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all	999
	of us, I pray!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you	999
	have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis	999
	wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the	999
	court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her	999
	to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and	999
	lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant	999
	you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift	999
	after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so	999
	rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in	999
	such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of	999
	the best and the fairest, that would have won any	999
	woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never	999
	get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels	999
	given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in	999
	any such sort, as they say, but in the way of	999
	honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get	999
	her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of	999
	them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which	999
	is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	But what says she to me? be brief, my good	999
	she-Mercury.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which	999
	she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you	999
	to notify that her husband will be absence from his	999
	house between ten and eleven.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Ten and eleven?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the	999
	picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,	999
	her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet	999
	woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very	999
	jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with	999
	him, good heart.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will	999
	not fail her.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to	999
	your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty	999
	commendations to you too: and let me tell you in	999
	your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and	999
	one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor	999
	evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the	999
	other: and she bade me tell your worship that her	999
	husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there	999
	will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon	999
	a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my	999
	good parts aside I have no other charms.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Blessing on your heart for't!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and	999
	Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	That were a jest indeed! they have not so little	999
	grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but	999
	Mistress Page would desire you to send her your	999
	little page, of all loves: her husband has a	999
	marvellous infection to the little page; and truly	999
	Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in	999
	Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what	999
	she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go	999
	to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as	999
	she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there	999
	be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must	999
	send her your page; no remedy.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Why, I will.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and	999
	go between you both; and in any case have a	999
	nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and	999
	the boy never need to understand any thing; for	999
	'tis not good that children should know any	999
	wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,	999
	as they say, and know the world.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's	999
	my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with	999
	this woman.	999
	999
	[Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY and ROBIN]	999
	999
	This news distracts me!	999
	999
PISTOL	This punk is one of Cupid's carriers:	999
	Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:	999
	Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make	999
	more of thy old body than I have done. Will they	999
	yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense	999
	of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I	999
	thank thee. Let them say 'tis grossly done; so it be	999
	fairly done, no matter.	999
	999
	[Enter BARDOLPH]	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain	999
	speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath	999
	sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Brook is his name?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Ay, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Call him in.	999
	999
	[Exit BARDOLPH]	999
	999
	Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow such	999
	liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress Ford and Mistress Page	999
	have I encompassed you? go to; via!	999
	999
	[Re-enter BARDOLPH, with FORD disguised]	999
	999
FORD	Bless you, sir!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	And you, sir! Would you speak with me?	999
	999
FORD	I make bold to press with so little preparation upon	999
	you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.	999
	999
	[Exit BARDOLPH]	999
	999
FORD	Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.	999
	999
FORD	Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;	999
	for I must let you understand I think myself in	999
	better plight for a lender than you are: the which	999
	hath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned	999
	intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all	999
	ways do lie open.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.	999
	999
FORD	Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:	999
	if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or	999
	half, for easing me of the carriage.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.	999
	999
FORD	I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be	999
	your servant.	999
	999
FORD	Sir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be brief	999
	with you,--and you have been a man long known to me,	999
	though I had never so good means, as desire, to make	999
	myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a	999
	thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine	999
	own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have	999
	one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,	999
	turn another into the register of your own; that I	999
	may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you	999
	yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Very well, sir; proceed.	999
	999
FORD	There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's	999
	name is Ford.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, sir.	999
	999
FORD	I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,	999
	bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting	999
	observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;	999
	fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly	999
	give me sight of her; not only bought many presents	999
	to give her, but have given largely to many to know	999
	what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued	999
	her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the	999
	wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have	999
	merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,	999
	I am sure, I have received none; unless experience	999
	be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite	999
	rate, and that hath taught me to say this:	999
	999
	'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;	999
	Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?	999
	999
FORD	Never.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Have you importuned her to such a purpose?	999
	999
FORD	Never.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Of what quality was your love, then?	999
	999
FORD	Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so	999
	that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place	999
	where I erected it.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?	999
	999
FORD	When I have told you that, I have told you all.	999
	Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in	999
	other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that	999
	there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir	999
	John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a	999
	gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable	999
	discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your	999
	place and person, generally allowed for your many	999
	war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	O, sir!	999
	999
FORD	Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend	999
	it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only	999
	give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as	999
	to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this	999
	Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to	999
	consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as	999
	any.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Would it apply well to the vehemency of your	999
	affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?	999
	Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.	999
	999
FORD	O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on	999
	the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my	999
	soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to	999
	be looked against. Now, could I could come to her	999
	with any detection in my hand, my desires had	999
	instance and argument to commend themselves: I	999
	could drive her then from the ward of her purity,	999
	her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand	999
	other her defences, which now are too too strongly	999
	embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Master Brook, I will first make bold with your	999
	money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a	999
	gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.	999
	999
FORD	O good sir!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I say you shall.	999
	999
FORD	Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want	999
	none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her	999
	own appointment; even as you came in to me, her	999
	assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I	999
	shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at	999
	that time the jealous rascally knave her husband	999
	will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall	999
	know how I speed.	999
	999
FORD	I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,	999
	sir?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:	999
	yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the	999
	jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the	999
	which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will	999
	use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;	999
	and there's my harvest-home.	999
	999
FORD	I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him	999
	if you saw him.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will	999
	stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my	999
	cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the	999
	cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I	999
	will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt	999
	lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.	999
	Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;	999
	thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and	999
	cuckold. Come to me soon at night.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FORD	What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is	999
	ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is	999
	improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the	999
	hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man	999
	have thought this? See the hell of having a false	999
	woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers	999
	ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not	999
	only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under	999
	the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that	999
	does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds	999
	well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are	999
	devils' additions, the names of fiends: but	999
	Cuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath	999
	not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he	999
	will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will	999
	rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh	999
	the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my	999
	aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling	999
	gelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,	999
	then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they	999
	think in their hearts they may effect, they will	999
	break their hearts but they will effect. God be	999
	praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.	999
	I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on	999
	Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;	999
	better three hours too soon than a minute too late.	999
	Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!	999

SHALLOW	He is the wiser man, master doctor: he is a curer of	999

	Is it not true, Master Page?	999
	999
PAGE	Master Shallow, you have yourself been a great	999

	make one. Though we are justices and doctors and	999
	churchmen, Master Page, we have some salt of our	999
	youth in us; we are the sons of women, Master Page.	999
	999
PAGE	'Tis true, Master Shallow.	999

	through Frogmore: I will bring thee where Mistress	999
	Anne Page is, at a farm-house a-feasting; and thou	999

	de knight, de lords, de gentlemen, my patients.	999

SIR HUGH EVANS	I pray you now, good master Slender's serving-man,	999
	and friend Simple by your name, which way have you	999
	looked for Master Caius, that calls himself doctor of physic?	999

SIMPLE	Marry, sir, the pittie-ward, the park-ward, every	999
	way; old Windsor way, and every way but the town	999
	way.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	I most fehemently desire you you will also look that	999

SIR HUGH EVANS	'Pless my soul, how full of chollors I am, and	999
	trempling of mind! I shall be glad if he have	999

	Heaven prosper the right! What weapons is he?	999
	999
SIMPLE	No weapons, sir. There comes my master, Master	999
	Shallow, and another gentleman, from Frogmore, over	999
	the stile, this way.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Pray you, give me my gown; or else keep it in your arms.	999
	999
	[Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER]	999
	999
SHALLOW	How now, master Parson! Good morrow, good Sir Hugh.	999
	Keep a gamester from the dice, and a good student	999
	from his book, and it is wonderful.	999
	999
SLENDER	[Aside]  Ah, sweet Anne Page!	999
	999
PAGE	'Save you, good Sir Hugh!	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	'Pless you from his mercy sake, all of you!	999
	999
SHALLOW	What, the sword and the word! do you study them	999
	both, master parson?	999
	999
PAGE	And youthful still! in your doublet and hose this	999
	raw rheumatic day!	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	There is reasons and causes for it.	999
	999
PAGE	We are come to you to do a good office, master parson.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Fery well: what is it?	999
	999
PAGE	Yonder is a most reverend gentleman, who, belike	999
	having received wrong by some person, is at most	999
	odds with his own gravity and patience that ever you	999
	saw.	999
	999
SHALLOW	I have lived fourscore years and upward; I never	999
	heard a man of his place, gravity and learning, so	999
	wide of his own respect.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	What is he?	999
	999
PAGE	I think you know him; Master Doctor Caius, the	999
	renowned French physician.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Got's will, and his passion of my heart! I had as	999
	lief you would tell me of a mess of porridge.	999
	999
PAGE	Why?	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	He has no more knowledge in Hibocrates and Galen,	999
	--and he is a knave besides; a cowardly knave as you	999
	would desires to be acquainted withal.	999
	999
PAGE	I warrant you, he's the man should fight with him.	999
	999
SHALLOW	[Aside]  O sweet Anne Page!	999
	999
SHALLOW	It appears so by his weapons. Keep them asunder:	999
	here comes Doctor Caius.	999
	999
	[Enter Host, DOCTOR CAIUS, and RUGBY]	999
	999
PAGE	Nay, good master parson, keep in your weapon.	999
	999
SHALLOW	So do you, good master doctor.	999
	999
Host	Disarm them, and let them question: let them keep	999
	their limbs whole and hack our English.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	I pray you, let-a me speak a word with your ear.	999
	Vherefore vill you not meet-a me?	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	[Aside to DOCTOR CAIUS]  Pray you, use your patience:	999
	in good time.	999

	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	[Aside to DOCTOR CAIUS]  Pray you let us not be	999
	laughing-stocks to other men's humours; I desire you	999
	in friendship, and I will one way or other make you amends.	999
	999
	[Aloud]	999
	999
	I will knog your urinals about your knave's cockscomb	999
	for missing your meetings and appointments.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Diable! Jack Rugby,--mine host de Jarteer,--have I	999
	not stay for him to kill him? have I not, at de place	999
	I did appoint?	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	As I am a Christians soul now, look you, this is the	999
	place appointed: I'll be judgement by mine host of	999
	the Garter.	999
	999
Host	Peace, I say, Gallia and Gaul, French and Welsh,	999
	soul-curer and body-curer!	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Ay, dat is very good; excellent.	999
	999
Host	Peace, I say! hear mine host of the Garter. Am I	999
	politic? am I subtle? am I a Machiavel? Shall I	999
	lose my doctor? no; he gives me the potions and the	999
	motions. Shall I lose my parson, my priest, my Sir	999
	Hugh? no; he gives me the proverbs and the	999
	no-verbs. Give me thy hand, terrestrial; so. Give me	999
	thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of art, I have	999
	deceived you both; I have directed you to wrong	999
	places: your hearts are mighty, your skins are	999
	whole, and let burnt sack be the issue. Come, lay	999
	their swords to pawn. Follow me, lads of peace;	999
	follow, follow, follow.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Trust me, a mad host. Follow, gentlemen, follow.	999

DOCTOR CAIUS	Ha, do I perceive dat? have you make-a de sot of	999
	us, ha, ha?	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	This is well; he has made us his vlouting-stog. I	999
	desire you that we may be friends; and let us knog	999
	our prains together to be revenge on this same	999
	scall, scurvy cogging companion, the host of the Garter.	999

SCENE II	A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Nay, keep your way, little gallant; you were wont to	999
	be a follower, but now you are a leader. Whether	999
	had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's heels?	999
	999
ROBIN	I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man	999
	than follow him like a dwarf.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	O, you are a flattering boy: now I see you'll be a courtier.	999
	999
	[Enter FORD]	999
	999
FORD	Well met, Mistress Page. Whither go you?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Truly, sir, to see your wife. Is she at home?	999
	999
FORD	Ay; and as idle as she may hang together, for want	999
	of company. I think, if your husbands were dead,	999
	you two would marry.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Be sure of that,--two other husbands.	999
	999
FORD	Where had you this pretty weather-cock?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	I cannot tell what the dickens his name is my	999
	husband had him of. What do you call your knight's	999
	name, sirrah?	999
	999
ROBIN	Sir John Falstaff.	999
	999
FORD	Sir John Falstaff!	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	He, he; I can never hit on's name. There is such a	999
	league between my good man and he! Is your wife at	999
	home indeed?	999
	999
FORD	Indeed she is.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	By your leave, sir: I am sick till I see her.	999
	999
	[Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN]	999
	999
FORD	Has Page any brains? hath he any eyes? hath he any	999
	thinking? Sure, they sleep; he hath no use of them.	999
	Why, this boy will carry a letter twenty mile, as	999
	easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve	999
	score. He pieces out his wife's inclination; he	999
	gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's	999
	going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A	999
	man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And	999
	Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;	999
	and our revolted wives share damnation together.	999
	Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck	999
	the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming	999
	Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and	999
	wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all	999
	my neighbours shall cry aim.	999
	999
	[Clock heard]	999
	999
	The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me	999
	search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be	999
	rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as	999
	positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is	999
	there: I will go.	999
	999

&C	|	999
	999
	999
FORD	Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home;	999
	and I pray you all go with me.	999
	999
SHALLOW	I must excuse myself, Master Ford.	999
	999
SLENDER	And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine with	999
	Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for	999
	more money than I'll speak of.	999
	999
SHALLOW	We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and	999
	my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.	999
	999
SLENDER	I hope I have your good will, father Page.	999
	999
PAGE	You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you:	999
	but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my nursh-a	999
	Quickly tell me so mush.	999
	999
Host	What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he	999
	dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he	999
	speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will	999
	carry't, he will carry't; 'tis in his buttons; he	999
	will carry't.	999
	999
PAGE	Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is	999
	of no having: he kept company with the wild prince	999
	and Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows too	999
	much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes	999
	with the finger of my substance: if he take her,	999
	let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on	999
	my consent, and my consent goes not that way.	999
	999
FORD	I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me	999
	to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have	999
	sport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,	999
	you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Well, fare you well: we shall have the freer wooing	999
	at Master Page's.	999
	999
	[Exeunt SHALLOW, and SLENDER]	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.	999
	999

Host	Farewell, my hearts: I will to my honest knight	999
	Falstaff, and drink canary with him.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FORD	[Aside]  I think I shall drink in pipe wine first	999
	with him; I'll make him dance. Will you go, gentles?	999

	999
	[Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE]	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	What, John! What, Robert!	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Quickly, quickly! is the buck-basket--	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	I warrant. What, Robin, I say!	999
	999
	[Enter Servants with a basket]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Come, come, come.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Here, set it down.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Give your men the charge; we must be brief.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be	999
	ready here hard by in the brew-house: and when I	999
	suddenly call you, come forth, and without any pause	999
	or staggering take this basket on your shoulders:	999
	that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry	999
	it among the whitsters in Datchet-mead, and there	999
	empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	You will do it?	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	I ha' told them over and over; they lack no	999
	direction. Be gone, and come when you are called.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Servants]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Here comes little Robin.	999
	999
	[Enter ROBIN]	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	How now, my eyas-musket! what news with you?	999
	999
ROBIN	My master, Sir John, is come in at your back-door,	999
	Mistress Ford, and requests your company.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?	999
	999
ROBIN	Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your	999
	being here and hath threatened to put me into	999
	everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for he	999
	swears he'll turn me away.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Thou'rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine shall be	999
	a tailor to thee and shall make thee a new doublet	999
	and hose. I'll go hide me.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.	999
	999
	[Exit ROBIN]	999
	999
	Mistress Page, remember you your cue.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Go to, then: we'll use this unwholesome humidity,	999
	this gross watery pumpion; we'll teach him to know	999
	turtles from jays.	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let	999
	me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the	999
	period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	O sweet Sir John!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,	999
	Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would	999
	thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the	999
	best lord; I would make thee my lady.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a pitiful lady!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Let the court of France show me such another. I see	999
	how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast	999
	the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the	999
	ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of	999
	Venetian admittance.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become nothing	999
	else; nor that well neither.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou	999
	wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm	999
	fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion	999
	to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see	999
	what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature	999
	thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Believe me, there is no such thing in me.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What made me love thee? let that persuade thee	999
	there's something extraordinary in thee. Come, I	999
	cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a	999
	many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like	999
	women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury	999
	in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none	999
	but thee; and thou deservest it.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress Page.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the	999
	Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek	999
	of a lime-kiln.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one	999
	day find it.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not	999
	be in that mind.	999
	999
ROBIN	[Within]  Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here's	999
	Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and	999
	looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Pray you, do so: she's a very tattling woman.	999
	999
	[FALSTAFF hides himself]	999
	999
	[Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN]	999
	999
	What's the matter? how now!	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,	999
	you're overthrown, you're undone for ever!	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	What's the matter, good Mistress Page?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an honest man	999
	to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	What cause of suspicion?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	What cause of suspicion! Out pon you! how am I	999
	mistook in you!	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Why, alas, what's the matter?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the	999
	officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that	999
	he says is here now in the house by your consent, to	999
	take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	'Tis not so, I hope.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man	999
	here! but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,	999
	with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a	999
	one. I come before to tell you. If you know	999
	yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you	999
	have a friend here convey, convey him out. Be not	999
	amazed; call all your senses to you; defend your	999
	reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear	999
	friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his	999
	peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were	999
	out of the house.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you	999
	had rather:' your husband's here at hand, bethink	999
	you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot	999
	hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here	999
	is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he	999
	may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as	999
	if it were going to bucking: or--it is whiting-time	999
	--send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	[Coming forward]  Let me see't, let me see't, O, let	999
	me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's	999
	counsel. I'll in.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	What, Sir John Falstaff! Are these your letters, knight?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I love thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here.	999
	I'll never--	999
	999
	[Gets into the basket; they cover him with foul linen]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Help to cover your master, boy. Call your men,	999
	Mistress Ford. You dissembling knight!	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	What, John! Robert! John!	999
	999
	[Exit ROBIN]	999
	999
	[Re-enter Servants]	999
	999
	Go take up these clothes here quickly. Where's the	999
	cowl-staff? look, how you drumble! Carry them to	999
	the laundress in Datchet-meat; quickly, come.	999
	999
	[Enter FORD, PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS]	999
	999
FORD	Pray you, come near: if I suspect without cause,	999
	why then make sport at me; then let me be your jest;	999
	I deserve it. How now! whither bear you this?	999
	999
Servant	To the laundress, forsooth.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You	999
	were best meddle with buck-washing.	999
	999
FORD	Buck! I would I could wash myself of the buck!	999
	Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;	999
	and of the season too, it shall appear.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Servants with the basket]	999
	999
	Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night; I'll tell you my	999
	dream. Here, here, here be my keys: ascend my	999
	chambers; search, seek, find out: I'll warrant	999
	we'll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.	999
	999
	[Locking the door]	999
	999
	So, now uncape.	999
	999
PAGE	Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.	999
	999
FORD	True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen: you shall see	999
	sport anon: follow me, gentlemen.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is not	999
	jealous in France.	999
	999
PAGE	Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Is there not a double excellency in this?	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	I know not which pleases me better, that my husband	999
	is deceived, or Sir John.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	What a taking was he in when your husband asked who	999
	was in the basket!	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so	999
	throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same	999
	strain were in the same distress.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	I think my husband hath some special suspicion of	999
	Falstaff's being here; for I never saw him so gross	999
	in his jealousy till now.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have	999
	more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will	999
	scarce obey this medicine.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress	999
	Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the	999
	water; and give him another hope, to betray him to	999
	another punishment?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow,	999
	eight o'clock, to have amends.	999
	999
	[Re-enter FORD, PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and	999
	SIR HUGH EVANS]	999
	999
FORD	I cannot find him: may be the knave bragged of that	999
	he could not compass.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	[Aside to MISTRESS FORD]  Heard you that?	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	You use me well, Master Ford, do you?	999
	999
FORD	Ay, I do so.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Heaven make you better than your thoughts!	999
	999
FORD	Amen!	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.	999
	999
FORD	Ay, ay; I must bear it.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	If there be any pody in the house, and in the	999
	chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses,	999
	heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	By gar, nor I too: there is no bodies.	999
	999
PAGE	Fie, fie, Master Ford! are you not ashamed? What	999
	spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I	999
	would not ha' your distemper in this kind for the	999
	wealth of Windsor Castle.	999
	999
FORD	'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	You suffer for a pad conscience: your wife is as	999
	honest a 'omans as I will desires among five	999
	thousand, and five hundred too.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.	999
	999
FORD	Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in	999
	the Park: I pray you, pardon me; I will hereafter	999
	make known to you why I have done this. Come,	999
	wife; come, Mistress Page. I pray you, pardon me;	999
	pray heartily, pardon me.	999
	999
PAGE	Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mock	999
	him. I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house	999
	to breakfast: after, we'll a-birding together; I	999
	have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?	999
	999
FORD	Any thing.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	If there is one, I shall make two in the company.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	If dere be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.	999
	999
FORD	Pray you, go, Master Page.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on the lousy	999
	knave, mine host.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart!	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!	999

	999
SCENE IV	A room in PAGE'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE]	999
	999
FENTON	I see I cannot get thy father's love;	999
	Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	Alas, how then?	999
	999
FENTON	                  Why, thou must be thyself.	999
	He doth object I am too great of birth--,	999
	And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,	999
	I seek to heal it only by his wealth:	999
	Besides these, other bars he lays before me,	999
	My riots past, my wild societies;	999
	And tells me 'tis a thing impossible	999
	I should love thee but as a property.	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	May be he tells you true.	999
	999
FENTON	No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!	999
	Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth	999
	Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:	999
	Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value	999
	Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags;	999
	And 'tis the very riches of thyself	999
	That now I aim at.	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	                  Gentle Master Fenton,	999
	Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir:	999
	If opportunity and humblest suit	999
	Cannot attain it, why, then,--hark you hither!	999
	999
	[They converse apart]	999
	999
	[Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and MISTRESS QUICKLY]	999
	999
SHALLOW	Break their talk, Mistress Quickly: my kinsman shall	999
	speak for himself.	999
	999
SLENDER	I'll make a shaft or a bolt on't: 'slid, 'tis but	999
	venturing.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Be not dismayed.	999
	999
SLENDER	No, she shall not dismay me: I care not for that,	999
	but that I am afeard.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Hark ye; Master Slender would speak a word with you.	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	I come to him.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	This is my father's choice.	999
	O, what a world of vile ill-favor'd faults	999
	Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you.	999
	999
SHALLOW	She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!	999
	999
SLENDER	I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you	999
	good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress	999
	Anne the jest, how my father stole two geese out of	999
	a pen, good uncle.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.	999
	999
SLENDER	Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in	999
	Gloucestershire.	999
	999
SHALLOW	He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.	999
	999
SLENDER	Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the	999
	degree of a squire.	999
	999
SHALLOW	He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good	999
	comfort. She calls you, coz: I'll leave you.	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	Now, Master Slender,--	999
	999
SLENDER	Now, good Mistress Anne,--	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	What is your will?	999
	999
SLENDER	My will! 'od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest	999
	indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I	999
	am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?	999
	999
SLENDER	Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing	999
	with you. Your father and my uncle hath made	999
	motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be	999
	his dole! They can tell you how things go better	999
	than I can: you may ask your father; here he comes.	999
	999
	[Enter PAGE and MISTRESS PAGE]	999
	999
PAGE	Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.	999
	Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here?	999
	You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house:	999
	I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.	999
	999
FENTON	Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.	999
	999
PAGE	She is no match for you.	999
	999
FENTON	Sir, will you hear me?	999
	999
PAGE	No, good Master Fenton.	999
	Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.	999
	Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Speak to Mistress Page.	999
	999
FENTON	Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter	999
	In such a righteous fashion as I do,	999
	Perforce, against all cheques, rebukes and manners,	999
	I must advance the colours of my love	999
	And not retire: let me have your good will.	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	That's my master, master doctor.	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	Alas, I had rather be set quick i' the earth	999
	And bowl'd to death with turnips!	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton,	999
	I will not be your friend nor enemy:	999
	My daughter will I question how she loves you,	999
	And as I find her, so am I affected.	999
	Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in;	999
	Her father will be angry.	999
	999
FENTON	Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.	999
	999
	[Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ANNE PAGE]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	This is my doing, now: 'Nay,' said I, 'will you cast	999
	away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on	999
	Master Fenton:' this is my doing.	999
	999
FENTON	I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night	999
	Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Now heaven send thee good fortune!	999
	999
	[Exit FENTON]	999
	999
	A kind heart he hath: a woman would run through	999
	fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I	999
	would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would	999
	Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master	999
	Fenton had her; I will do what I can for them all	999
	three; for so I have promised, and I'll be as good	999
	as my word; but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,	999
	I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from	999
	my two mistresses: what a beast am I to slack it!	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE V	A room in the Garter Inn.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Bardolph, I say,--	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Here, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.	999
	999
	[Exit BARDOLPH]	999
	999
	Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a	999
	barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the	999
	Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,	999
	I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give	999
	them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues	999
	slighted me into the river with as little remorse as	999
	they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,	999
	fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size	999
	that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the	999
	bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had	999
	been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and	999
	shallow,--a death that I abhor; for the water swells	999
	a man; and what a thing should I have been when I	999
	had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BARDOLPH with sack]	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my	999
	belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for	999
	pills to cool the reins. Call her in.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Come in, woman!	999
	999
	[Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	By your leave; I cry you mercy: give your worship	999
	good morrow.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Take away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of	999
	sack finely.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	With eggs, sir?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Simple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.	999
	999
	[Exit BARDOLPH]	999
	How now!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown	999
	into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault:	999
	she does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn	999
	your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning	999
	a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her	999
	between eight and nine: I must carry her word	999
	quickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her	999
	think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,	999
	and then judge of my merit.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	I will tell her.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Eight and nine, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, be gone: I will not miss her.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Peace be with you, sir.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word	999
	to stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes.	999
	999
	[Enter FORD]	999
	999
FORD	Bless you, sir!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed	999
	between me and Ford's wife?	999
	999
FORD	That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her	999
	house the hour she appointed me.	999
	999
FORD	And sped you, sir?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.	999
	999
FORD	How so, sir? Did she change her determination?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her	999
	husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual	999
	'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our	999
	encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,	999
	and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;	999
	and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither	999
	provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,	999
	forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.	999
	999
FORD	What, while you were there?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	While I was there.	999
	999
FORD	And did he search for you, and could not find you?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes	999
	in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's	999
	approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's	999
	distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.	999
	999
FORD	A buck-basket!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul	999
	shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy	999
	napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest	999
	compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.	999
	999
FORD	And how long lay you there?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have	999
	suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.	999
	Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's	999
	knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their	999
	mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to	999
	Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met	999
	the jealous knave their master in the door, who	999
	asked them once or twice what they had in their	999
	basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave	999
	would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he	999
	should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he	999
	for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But	999
	mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs	999
	of three several deaths; first, an intolerable	999
	fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten	999
	bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good	999
	bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to	999
	point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,	999
	like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes	999
	that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a	999
	man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject	999
	to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution	999
	and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.	999
	And in the height of this bath, when I was more than	999
	half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be	999
	thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,	999
	in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of	999
	that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.	999
	999
FORD	In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you	999
	have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;	999
	you'll undertake her no more?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have	999
	been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her	999
	husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have	999
	received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt	999
	eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.	999
	999
FORD	'Tis past eight already, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.	999
	Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall	999
	know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be	999
	crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall	999
	have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall	999
	cuckold Ford.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FORD	Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I	999
	sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!	999
	there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.	999
	This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen	999
	and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself	999
	what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my	999
	house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he	999
	should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,	999
	nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that	999
	guides him should aid him, I will search	999
	impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,	999
	yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:	999
	if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go	999
	with me: I'll be horn-mad.	999

	WILLIAM PAGE]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Sure he is by this, or will be presently: but,	999
	truly, he is very courageous mad about his throwing	999
	into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	I'll be with her by and by; I'll but bring my young	999
	man here to school. Look, where his master comes;	999
	'tis a playing-day, I see.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR HUGH EVANS]	999
	999
	How now, Sir Hugh! no school to-day?	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Blessing of his heart!	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in	999
	the world at his book. I pray you, ask him some	999
	questions in his accidence.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Come on, sirrah; hold up your head; answer your	999
	master, be not afraid.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	William, how many numbers is in nouns?	999
	999
WILLIAM PAGE	Two.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Truly, I thought there had been one number more,	999
	because they say, ''Od's nouns.'	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Peace your tattlings! What is 'fair,' William?	999
	999
WILLIAM PAGE	Pulcher.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Polecats! there are fairer things than polecats, sure.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	You are a very simplicity 'oman: I pray you peace.	999
	What is 'lapis,' William?	999
	999
WILLIAM PAGE	A stone.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	And what is 'a stone,' William?	999
	999
WILLIAM PAGE	A pebble.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	No, it is 'lapis:' I pray you, remember in your prain.	999
	999
WILLIAM PAGE	Lapis.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	That is a good William. What is he, William, that	999
	does lend articles?	999
	999
WILLIAM PAGE	Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus	999
	declined, Singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Nominativo, hig, hag, hog; pray you, mark:	999
	genitivo, hujus. Well, what is your accusative case?	999
	999
WILLIAM PAGE	Accusativo, hinc.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	I pray you, have your remembrance, child,	999
	accusative, hung, hang, hog.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Leave your prabbles, 'oman. What is the focative	999
	case, William?	999
	999
WILLIAM PAGE	O,--vocativo, O.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Remember, William; focative is caret.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	And that's a good root.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	'Oman, forbear.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Peace!	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	What is your genitive case plural, William?	999
	999
WILLIAM PAGE	Genitive case!	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Ay.	999
	999
WILLIAM PAGE	Genitive,--horum, harum, horum.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Vengeance of Jenny's case! fie on her! never name	999
	her, child, if she be a whore.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	For shame, 'oman.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	You do ill to teach the child such words: he	999
	teaches him to hick and to hack, which they'll do	999
	fast enough of themselves, and to call 'horum:' fie upon you!	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	'Oman, art thou lunatics? hast thou no	999
	understandings for thy cases and the numbers of the	999
	genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as	999
	I would desires.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Prithee, hold thy peace.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.	999
	999
WILLIAM PAGE	Forsooth, I have forgot.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	It is qui, quae, quod: if you forget your 'quies,'	999
	your 'quaes,' and your 'quods,' you must be	999
	preeches. Go your ways, and play; go.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	He is a better scholar than I thought he was.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.	999

SCENE II	A room in FORD'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF and MISTRESS FORD]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my	999
	sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,	999
	and I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not	999
	only, Mistress Ford, in the simple	999
	office of love, but in all the accoutrement,	999
	complement and ceremony of it. But are you	999
	sure of your husband now?	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	[Within]  What, ho, gossip Ford! what, ho!	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Step into the chamber, Sir John.	999
	999
	[Exit FALSTAFF]	999
	999
	[Enter MISTRESS PAGE]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	How now, sweetheart! who's at home besides yourself?	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Why, none but mine own people.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Indeed!	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	No, certainly.	999
	999
	[Aside to her]	999
	999
	Speak louder.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Why?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:	999
	he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails	999
	against all married mankind; so curses all Eve's	999
	daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets	999
	himself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer	999
	out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but	999
	tameness, civility and patience, to this his	999
	distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Why, does he talk of him?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the	999
	last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests	999
	to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and	999
	the rest of their company from their sport, to make	999
	another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad	999
	the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	How near is he, Mistress Page?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	I am undone! The knight is here.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Why then you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead	999
	man. What a woman are you!--Away with him, away	999
	with him! better shame than murder.	999
	999
FORD	Which way should be go? how should I bestow him?	999
	Shall I put him into the basket again?	999
	999
	[Re-enter FALSTAFF]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go	999
	out ere he come?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door	999
	with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise	999
	you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	There they always use to discharge their	999
	birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Where is it?	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,	999
	coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an	999
	abstract for the remembrance of such places, and	999
	goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I'll go out then.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir	999
	John. Unless you go out disguised--	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	How might we disguise him?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown	999
	big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,	999
	a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather	999
	than a mischief.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a	999
	gown above.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he	999
	is: and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler	999
	too. Run up, Sir John.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I will	999
	look some linen for your head.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Quick, quick! we'll come dress you straight: put	999
	on the gown the while.	999
	999
	[Exit FALSTAFF]	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	I would my husband would meet him in this shape: he	999
	cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears	999
	she's a witch; forbade her my house and hath	999
	threatened to beat her.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel, and the	999
	devil guide his cudgel afterwards!	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	But is my husband coming?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Ah, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the basket	999
	too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry the	999
	basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as	999
	they did last time.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Nay, but he'll be here presently: let's go dress him	999
	like the witch of Brentford.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the	999
	basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him enough.	999
	We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,	999
	Wives may be merry, and yet honest too:	999
	We do not act that often jest and laugh;	999
	'Tis old, but true, Still swine eat all the draff.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Re-enter MISTRESS FORD with two Servants]	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders:	999
	your master is hard at door; if he bid you set it	999
	down, obey him: quickly, dispatch.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
First Servant	Come, come, take it up.	999
	999
Second Servant	Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.	999
	999
First Servant	I hope not; I had as lief bear so much lead.	999
	999
	[Enter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and	999
	SIR HUGH EVANS]	999
	999
FORD	Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any	999
	way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket,	999
	villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!	999
	O you panderly rascals! there's a knot, a ging, a	999
	pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil	999
	be shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!	999
	Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!	999
	999
PAGE	Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go	999
	loose any longer; you must be pinioned.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog!	999
	999
SHALLOW	Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.	999
	999
FORD	So say I too, sir.	999
	999
	[Re-enter MISTRESS FORD]	999
	999
	Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford the honest	999
	woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that	999
	hath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect	999
	without cause, mistress, do I?	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in	999
	any dishonesty.	999
	999
FORD	Well said, brazen-face! hold it out. Come forth, sirrah!	999
	999
	[Pulling clothes out of the basket]	999
	999
PAGE	This passes!	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Are you not ashamed? let the clothes alone.	999
	999
FORD	I shall find you anon.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	'Tis unreasonable! Will you take up your wife's	999
	clothes? Come away.	999
	999
FORD	Empty the basket, I say!	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Why, man, why?	999
	999
FORD	Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed	999
	out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may	999
	not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is:	999
	my intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.	999
	Pluck me out all the linen.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.	999
	999
PAGE	Here's no man.	999
	999
SHALLOW	By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this	999
	wrongs you.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the	999
	imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies.	999
	999
FORD	Well, he's not here I seek for.	999
	999
PAGE	No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.	999
	999
FORD	Help to search my house this one time. If I find	999
	not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let	999
	me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of	999
	me, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow	999
	walnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more;	999
	once more search with me.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	What, ho, Mistress Page! come you and the old woman	999
	down; my husband will come into the chamber.	999
	999
FORD	Old woman! what old woman's that?	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Nay, it is my maid's aunt of Brentford.	999
	999
FORD	A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not	999
	forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does	999
	she? We are simple men; we do not know what's	999
	brought to pass under the profession of	999
	fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,	999
	by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond	999
	our element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,	999
	you hag, you; come down, I say!	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Nay, good, sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let him	999
	not strike the old woman.	999
	999
	[Re-enter FALSTAFF in woman's clothes, and	999
	MISTRESS PAGE]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Come, Mother Prat; come, give me your hand.	999
	999
FORD	I'll prat her.	999
	999
	[Beating him]	999
	999
	Out of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage, you	999
	polecat, you runyon! out, out! I'll conjure you,	999
	I'll fortune-tell you.	999
	999
	[Exit FALSTAFF]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed the	999
	poor woman.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.	999
	999
FORD	Hang her, witch!	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	By the yea and no, I think the 'oman is a witch	999
	indeed: I like not when a 'oman has a great peard;	999
	I spy a great peard under his muffler.	999
	999
FORD	Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow;	999
	see but the issue of my jealousy: if I cry out thus	999
	upon no trail, never trust me when I open again.	999
	999
PAGE	Let's obey his humour a little further: come,	999
	gentlemen.	999
	999
	[Exeunt FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and	999
	SIR HUGH EVANS]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Nay, by the mass, that he did not; he beat him most	999
	unpitifully, methought.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the	999
	altar; it hath done meritorious service.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	What think you? may we, with the warrant of	999
	womanhood and the witness of a good conscience,	999
	pursue him with any further revenge?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out of	999
	him: if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with	999
	fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the	999
	way of waste, attempt us again.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the	999
	figures out of your husband's brains. If they can	999
	find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight	999
	shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be	999
	the ministers.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed: and	999
	methinks there would be no period to the jest,	999
	should he not be publicly shamed.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Come, to the forge with it then; shape it: I would	999
	not have things cool.	999

	As firm as faith.	999
	999
PAGE	'Tis well, 'tis well; no more:	999
	Be not as extreme in submission	999
	As in offence.	999
	But let our plot go forward: let our wives	999
	Yet once again, to make us public sport,	999
	Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,	999
	Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.	999
	999
FORD	There is no better way than that they spoke of.	999
	999
PAGE	How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park	999
	at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has	999
	been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks	999
	there should be terrors in him that he should not	999
	come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have	999
	no desires.	999
	999
PAGE	So think I too.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,	999
	And let us two devise to bring him thither.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,	999
	Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,	999
	Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,	999
	Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;	999
	And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle	999
	And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain	999
	In a most hideous and dreadful manner:	999
	You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know	999
	The superstitious idle-headed eld	999
	Received and did deliver to our age	999
	This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.	999
	999
PAGE	Why, yet there want not many that do fear	999
	In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak:	999
	But what of this?	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	                  Marry, this is our device;	999
	That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.	999
	999
PAGE	Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:	999
	And in this shape when you have brought him thither,	999
	What shall be done with him? what is your plot?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:	999
	Nan Page my daughter and my little son	999
	And three or four more of their growth we'll dress	999
	Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,	999
	With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,	999
	And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,	999
	As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,	999
	Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once	999
	With some diffused song: upon their sight,	999
	We two in great amazedness will fly:	999
	Then let them all encircle him about	999
	And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,	999
	And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,	999
	In their so sacred paths he dares to tread	999
	In shape profane.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	                  And till he tell the truth,	999
	Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound	999
	And burn him with their tapers.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	The truth being known,	999
	We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,	999
	And mock him home to Windsor.	999
	999
FORD	The children must	999
	Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	I will teach the children their behaviors; and I	999
	will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the	999
	knight with my taber.	999
	999
FORD	That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,	999
	Finely attired in a robe of white.	999
	999
PAGE	That silk will I go buy.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
		   And in that time	999
	Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away	999
	And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight.	999
	999
FORD	Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook	999
	He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Fear not you that. Go get us properties	999
	And tricking for our fairies.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery	999
	honest knaveries.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PAGE, FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Go, Mistress Ford,	999
	Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.	999
	999
	[Exit MISTRESS FORD]	999
	999
	I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,	999
	And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.	999
	That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;	999
	And he my husband best of all affects.	999
	The doctor is well money'd, and his friends	999
	Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,	999
	Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.	999

	999
	999
SCENE V	A room in the Garter Inn.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Host and SIMPLE]	999
	999
Host	What wouldst thou have, boor? what: thick-skin?	999
	speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.	999
	999
SIMPLE	Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff	999
	from Master Slender.	999
	999
Host	There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his	999
	standing-bed and truckle-bed; 'tis painted about	999
	with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go	999
	knock and call; hell speak like an Anthropophaginian	999
	unto thee: knock, I say.	999
	999
SIMPLE	There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his	999
	chamber: I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come	999
	down; I come to speak with her, indeed.	999
	999
Host	Ha! a fat woman! the knight may be robbed: I'll	999
	call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from	999
	thy lungs military: art thou there? it is thine	999
	host, thine Ephesian, calls.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	[Above]  How now, mine host!	999
	999
Host	Here's a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of	999
	thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her	999
	descend; my chambers are honourable: fie! privacy?	999
	fie!	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	There was, mine host, an old fat woman even now with	999
	me; but she's gone.	999
	999
SIMPLE	Pray you, sir, was't not the wise woman of	999
	Brentford?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Ay, marry, was it, mussel-shell: what would you with her?	999
	999
SIMPLE	My master, sir, Master Slender, sent to her, seeing	999
	her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether	999
	one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the	999
	chain or no.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I spake with the old woman about it.	999
	999
SIMPLE	And what says she, I pray, sir?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Marry, she says that the very same man that	999
	beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of	999
	it.	999
	999
SIMPLE	I would I could have spoken with the woman herself;	999
	I had other things to have spoken with her too from	999
	him.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What are they? let us know.	999
	999
Host	Ay, come; quick.	999
	999
SIMPLE	I may not conceal them, sir.	999
	999
Host	Conceal them, or thou diest.	999
	999
SIMPLE	Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne	999
	Page; to know if it were my master's fortune to	999
	have her or no.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Tis, 'tis his fortune.	999
	999
SIMPLE	What, sir?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.	999
	999
SIMPLE	May I be bold to say so, sir?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Ay, sir; like who more bold.	999
	999
SIMPLE	I thank your worship: I shall make my master glad	999
	with these tidings.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
Host	Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was	999
	there a wise woman with thee?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught	999
	me more wit than ever I learned before in my life;	999
	and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for	999
	my learning.	999
	999
	[Enter BARDOLPH]	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage!	999
	999
Host	Where be my horses? speak well of them, varletto.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I came	999
	beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of	999
	them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away,	999
	like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.	999
	999
Host	They are gone but to meet the duke, villain: do not	999
	say they be fled; Germans are honest men.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR HUGH EVANS]	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Where is mine host?	999
	999
Host	What is the matter, sir?	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Have a care of your entertainments: there is a	999
	friend of mine come to town tells me there is three	999
	cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of	999
	Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and	999
	money. I tell you for good will, look you: you	999
	are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and	999
	'tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter DOCTOR CAIUS]	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Vere is mine host de Jarteer?	999
	999
Host	Here, master doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me dat	999
	you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by	999
	my trot, dere is no duke dat the court is know to	999
	come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
Host	Hue and cry, villain, go! Assist me, knight. I am	999
	undone! Fly, run, hue and cry, villain! I am undone!	999
	999
	[Exeunt Host and BARDOLPH]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I would all the world might be cozened; for I have	999
	been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to	999
	the ear of the court, how I have been transformed	999
	and how my transformation hath been washed and	999
	cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by	999
	drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant	999
	they would whip me with their fine wits till I were	999
	as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered	999
	since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my	999
	wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.	999
	999
	[Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY]	999
	999
	Now, whence come you?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	From the two parties, forsooth.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	The devil take one party and his dam the other! and	999
	so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more	999
	for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy	999
	of man's disposition is able to bear.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;	999
	speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,	999
	is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a	999
	white spot about her.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was	999
	beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;	999
	and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of	999
	Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,	999
	my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,	999
	delivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the	999
	stocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber: you	999
	shall hear how things go; and, I warrant, to your	999
	content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good	999
	hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!	999
	Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that	999
	you are so crossed.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Come up into my chamber.	999

	999
	[Enter FENTON and Host]	999
	999
Host	Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy: I	999
	will give over all.	999
	999
FENTON	Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,	999
	And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee	999
	A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.	999
	999
Host	I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will at the	999
	least keep your counsel.	999
	999
FENTON	From time to time I have acquainted you	999
	With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;	999
	Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,	999
	So far forth as herself might be her chooser,	999
	Even to my wish: I have a letter from her	999
	Of such contents as you will wonder at;	999
	The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,	999
	That neither singly can be manifested,	999
	Without the show of both; fat Falstaff	999
	Hath a great scene: the image of the jest	999
	I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.	999
	To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,	999
	Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;	999
	The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,	999
	While other jests are something rank on foot,	999
	Her father hath commanded her to slip	999
	Away with Slender and with him at Eton	999
	Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,	999
	Her mother, ever strong against that match	999
	And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed	999
	That he shall likewise shuffle her away,	999
	While other sports are tasking of their minds,	999
	And at the deanery, where a priest attends,	999
	Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot	999
	She seemingly obedient likewise hath	999
	Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:	999
	Her father means she shall be all in white,	999
	And in that habit, when Slender sees his time	999
	To take her by the hand and bid her go,	999
	She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,	999
	The better to denote her to the doctor,	999
	For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,	999
	That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,	999
	With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;	999
	And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,	999
	To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,	999
	The maid hath given consent to go with him.	999
	999
Host	Which means she to deceive, father or mother?	999
	999
FENTON	Both, my good host, to go along with me:	999
	And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar	999
	To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,	999
	And, in the lawful name of marrying,	999
	To give our hearts united ceremony.	999
	999
Host	Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar:	999
	Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.	999
	999
FENTON	So shall I evermore be bound to thee;	999
	Besides, I'll make a present recompense.	999

	999
FALSTAFF	Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll hold. This is	999
	the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd	999
	numbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in	999
	odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	I'll provide you a chain; and I'll do what I can to	999
	get you a pair of horns.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Away, I say; time wears: hold up your head, and mince.	999

	999

	see wonders.	999
	999
FORD	Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me	999
	you had appointed?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor	999
	old man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a	999
	poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,	999
	hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,	999
	Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell	999
	you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a	999
	woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear	999
	not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know	999
	also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along	999
	with me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I	999
	plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew	999
	not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow	999
	me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave	999
	Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I	999
	will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.	999
	Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.	999

	my daughter.	999
	999
SLENDER	Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a	999
	nay-word how to know one another: I come to her in	999
	white, and cry 'mum;' she cries 'budget;' and by	999
	that we know one another.	999
	999
SHALLOW	That's good too: but what needs either your 'mum'	999
	or her 'budget?' the white will decipher her well	999
	enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.	999
	999
PAGE	The night is dark; light and spirits will become it	999

	be pold, I pray you; follow me into the pit; and	999
	when I give the watch-'ords, do as I pid you:	999
	come, come; trib, trib.	999

	THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR	999
	999
	999
ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE V	Another part of the Park.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF disguised as Herne]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute	999
	draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!	999
	Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love	999
	set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some	999
	respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man	999
	a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love	999
	of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew	999
	to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in	999
	the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And	999
	then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think	999
	on 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot	999
	backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a	999
	Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the	999
	forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can	999
	blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my	999
	doe?	999
	999
	[Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE]	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Sir John! art thou there, my deer? my male deer?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My doe with the black scut! Let the sky rain	999
	potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green	999
	Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let	999
	there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will	999
	keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow	999
	of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.	999
	Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?	999
	Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes	999
	restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!	999
	999
	[Noise within]	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Alas, what noise?	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Heaven forgive our sins	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What should this be?	999
	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	|	999
	|  Away, away!	999
MISTRESS PAGE	|	999
	999
	999
	[They run off]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I think the devil will not have me damned, lest the	999
	oil that's in me should set hell on fire; he would	999
	never else cross me thus.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR HUGH EVANS, disguised as before; PISTOL,	999
	as Hobgoblin; MISTRESS QUICKLY, ANNE PAGE, and	999
	others, as Fairies, with tapers]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Fairies, black, grey, green, and white,	999
	You moonshine revellers and shades of night,	999
	You orphan heirs of fixed destiny,	999
	Attend your office and your quality.	999
	Crier Hobgoblin, make the fairy oyes.	999
	999
PISTOL	Elves, list your names; silence, you airy toys.	999
	Cricket, to Windsor chimneys shalt thou leap:	999
	Where fires thou find'st unraked and hearths unswept,	999
	There pinch the maids as blue as bilberry:	999
	Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	They are fairies; he that speaks to them shall die:	999
	I'll wink and couch: no man their works must eye.	999
	999
	[Lies down upon his face]	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Where's Bede? Go you, and where you find a maid	999
	That, ere she sleep, has thrice her prayers said,	999
	Raise up the organs of her fantasy;	999
	Sleep she as sound as careless infancy:	999
	But those as sleep and think not on their sins,	999
	Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	About, about;	999
	Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:	999
	Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:	999
	That it may stand till the perpetual doom,	999
	In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,	999
	Worthy the owner, and the owner it.	999
	The several chairs of order look you scour	999
	With juice of balm and every precious flower:	999
	Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,	999
	With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!	999
	And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,	999
	Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:	999
	The expressure that it bears, green let it be,	999
	More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;	999
	And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write	999
	In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;	999
	Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,	999
	Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:	999
	Fairies use flowers for their charactery.	999
	Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,	999
	Our dance of custom round about the oak	999
	Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set	999
	And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,	999
	To guide our measure round about the tree.	999
	But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he	999
	transform me to a piece of cheese!	999
	999
PISTOL	Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:	999
	If he be chaste, the flame will back descend	999
	And turn him to no pain; but if he start,	999
	It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.	999
	999
PISTOL	A trial, come.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Come, will this wood take fire?	999
	999
	[They burn him with their tapers]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Oh, Oh, Oh!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!	999
	About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;	999
	And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.	999
		999
	SONG.	999
	Fie on sinful fantasy!	999
	Fie on lust and luxury!	999
	Lust is but a bloody fire,	999
	Kindled with unchaste desire,	999
	Fed in heart, whose flames aspire	999
	As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.	999
	Pinch him, fairies, mutually;	999
	Pinch him for his villany;	999
	Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,	999
	Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.	999
	999
	[During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS	999
	comes one way, and steals away a boy in green;	999
	SLENDER another way, and takes off a boy in white;	999
	and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE.	999
	A noise of hunting is heard within. All the	999
	Fairies run away. FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's	999
	head, and rises]	999
	999
	[Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, and MISTRESS FORD]	999
	999
PAGE	Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now	999
	Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher	999
	Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?	999
	See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes	999
	Become the forest better than the town?	999
	999
FORD	Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,	999
	Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his	999
	horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath	999
	enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his	999
	cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be	999
	paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for	999
	it, Master Brook.	999
	999
MISTRESS FORD	Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.	999
	I will never take you for my love again; but I will	999
	always count you my deer.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.	999
	999
FORD	Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	And these are not fairies? I was three or four	999
	times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet	999
	the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my	999
	powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a	999
	received belief, in despite of the teeth of all	999
	rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now	999
	how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon	999
	ill employment!	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your	999
	desires, and fairies will not pinse you.	999
	999
FORD	Well said, fairy Hugh.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.	999
	999
FORD	I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art	999
	able to woo her in good English.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that	999
	it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as	999
	this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I	999
	have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked	999
	with a piece of toasted cheese.	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the	999
	taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This	999
	is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking	999
	through the realm.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the	999
	virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders	999
	and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,	999
	that ever the devil could have made you our delight?	999
	999
FORD	What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	A puffed man?	999
	999
PAGE	Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?	999
	999
FORD	And one that is as slanderous as Satan?	999
	999
PAGE	And as poor as Job?	999
	999
FORD	And as wicked as his wife?	999
	999
SIR HUGH EVANS	And given to fornications, and to taverns and sack	999
	and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and	999
	swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I	999
	am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh	999
	flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use	999
	me as you will.	999
	999
FORD	Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one	999
	Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to	999
	whom you should have been a pander: over and above	999
	that you have suffered, I think to repay that money	999
	will be a biting affliction.	999
	999
PAGE	Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset	999
	to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to	999
	laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her	999
	Master Slender hath married her daughter.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	[Aside]  Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be my	999
	daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.	999
	999
	[Enter SLENDER]	999
	999
SLENDER	Whoa ho! ho, father Page!	999
	999
PAGE	Son, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched?	999
	999
SLENDER	Dispatched! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire	999
	know on't; would I were hanged, la, else.	999
	999
PAGE	Of what, son?	999
	999
SLENDER	I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,	999
	and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been	999
	i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he	999
	should have swinged me. If I did not think it had	999
	been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and 'tis	999
	a postmaster's boy.	999
	999
PAGE	Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.	999
	999
SLENDER	What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took	999
	a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for	999
	all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had	999
	him.	999
	999
PAGE	Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how	999
	you should know my daughter by her garments?	999
	999
SLENDER	I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she	999
	cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet	999
	it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;	999
	turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is	999
	now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.	999
	999
	[Enter DOCTOR CAIUS]	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'	999
	married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;	999
	it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Why, did you take her in green?	999
	999
DOCTOR CAIUS	Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FORD	This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?	999
	999
PAGE	My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.	999
	999
	[Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE]	999
	999
	How now, Master Fenton!	999
	999
ANNE PAGE	Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!	999
	999
PAGE	Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Why went you not with master doctor, maid?	999
	999
FENTON	You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.	999
	You would have married her most shamefully,	999
	Where there was no proportion held in love.	999
	The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,	999
	Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.	999
	The offence is holy that she hath committed;	999
	And this deceit loses the name of craft,	999
	Of disobedience, or unduteous title,	999
	Since therein she doth evitate and shun	999
	A thousand irreligious cursed hours,	999
	Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.	999
	999
FORD	Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:	999
	In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;	999
	Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to	999
	strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.	999
	999
PAGE	Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!	999
	What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.	999
	999
MISTRESS PAGE	Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,	999
	Heaven give you many, many merry days!	999
	Good husband, let us every one go home,	999
	And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;	999
	Sir John and all.	999
	999
FORD	                  Let it be so. Sir John,	999
	To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word	999
	For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Athens. The palace of THESEUS.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and	999
	Attendants]	999
	999
THESEUS	Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour	999
	Draws on apace; four happy days bring in	999
	Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow	999
	This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,	999
	Like to a step-dame or a dowager	999
	Long withering out a young man revenue.	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;	999
	Four nights will quickly dream away the time;	999
	And then the moon, like to a silver bow	999
	New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night	999
	Of our solemnities.	999
	999
THESEUS	Go, Philostrate,	999
	Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;	999
	Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;	999
	Turn melancholy forth to funerals;	999
	The pale companion is not for our pomp.	999
	999
	[Exit PHILOSTRATE]	999
	999
	Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,	999
	And won thy love, doing thee injuries;	999
	But I will wed thee in another key,	999
	With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.	999
	999
	[Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS]	999
	999
EGEUS	Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!	999
	999
THESEUS	Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?	999
	999
EGEUS	Full of vexation come I, with complaint	999
	Against my child, my daughter Hermia.	999
	Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,	999
	This man hath my consent to marry her.	999
	Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,	999
	This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;	999
	Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,	999
	And interchanged love-tokens with my child:	999
	Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,	999
	With feigning voice verses of feigning love,	999
	And stolen the impression of her fantasy	999
	With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,	999
	Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers	999
	Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:	999
	With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,	999
	Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,	999
	To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,	999
	Be it so she; will not here before your grace	999
	Consent to marry with Demetrius,	999
	I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,	999
	As she is mine, I may dispose of her:	999
	Which shall be either to this gentleman	999
	Or to her death, according to our law	999
	Immediately provided in that case.	999
	999
THESEUS	What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:	999
	To you your father should be as a god;	999
	One that composed your beauties, yea, and one	999
	To whom you are but as a form in wax	999
	By him imprinted and within his power	999
	To leave the figure or disfigure it.	999
	Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.	999
	999
HERMIA	So is Lysander.	999
	999
THESEUS	                  In himself he is;	999
	But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,	999
	The other must be held the worthier.	999
	999
HERMIA	I would my father look'd but with my eyes.	999
	999
THESEUS	Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.	999
	999
HERMIA	I do entreat your grace to pardon me.	999
	I know not by what power I am made bold,	999
	Nor how it may concern my modesty,	999
	In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;	999
	But I beseech your grace that I may know	999
	The worst that may befall me in this case,	999
	If I refuse to wed Demetrius.	999
	999
THESEUS	Either to die the death or to abjure	999
	For ever the society of men.	999
	Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;	999
	Know of your youth, examine well your blood,	999
	Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,	999
	You can endure the livery of a nun,	999
	For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,	999
	To live a barren sister all your life,	999
	Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.	999
	Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,	999
	To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;	999
	But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,	999
	Than that which withering on the virgin thorn	999
	Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.	999
	999
HERMIA	So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,	999
	Ere I will my virgin patent up	999
	Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke	999
	My soul consents not to give sovereignty.	999
	999
THESEUS	Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--	999
	The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,	999
	For everlasting bond of fellowship--	999
	Upon that day either prepare to die	999
	For disobedience to your father's will,	999
	Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;	999
	Or on Diana's altar to protest	999
	For aye austerity and single life.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield	999
	Thy crazed title to my certain right.	999
	999
LYSANDER	You have her father's love, Demetrius;	999
	Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.	999
	999
EGEUS	Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,	999
	And what is mine my love shall render him.	999
	And she is mine, and all my right of her	999
	I do estate unto Demetrius.	999
	999
LYSANDER	I am, my lord, as well derived as he,	999
	As well possess'd; my love is more than his;	999
	My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,	999
	If not with vantage, as Demetrius';	999
	And, which is more than all these boasts can be,	999
	I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:	999
	Why should not I then prosecute my right?	999
	Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,	999
	Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,	999
	And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,	999
	Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,	999
	Upon this spotted and inconstant man.	999
	999
THESEUS	I must confess that I have heard so much,	999
	And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;	999
	But, being over-full of self-affairs,	999
	My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;	999
	And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,	999
	I have some private schooling for you both.	999
	For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself	999
	To fit your fancies to your father's will;	999
	Or else the law of Athens yields you up--	999
	Which by no means we may extenuate--	999
	To death, or to a vow of single life.	999
	Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?	999
	Demetrius and Egeus, go along:	999
	I must employ you in some business	999
	Against our nuptial and confer with you	999
	Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.	999
	999
EGEUS	With duty and desire we follow you.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA]	999
	999
LYSANDER	How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?	999
	How chance the roses there do fade so fast?	999
	999
HERMIA	Belike for want of rain, which I could well	999
	Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,	999
	Could ever hear by tale or history,	999
	The course of true love never did run smooth;	999
	But, either it was different in blood,--	999
	999
HERMIA	O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--	999
	999
HERMIA	O spite! too old to be engaged to young.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--	999
	999
HERMIA	O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,	999
	War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,	999
	Making it momentany as a sound,	999
	Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;	999
	Brief as the lightning in the collied night,	999
	That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,	999
	And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'	999
	The jaws of darkness do devour it up:	999
	So quick bright things come to confusion.	999
	999
HERMIA	If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,	999
	It stands as an edict in destiny:	999
	Then let us teach our trial patience,	999
	Because it is a customary cross,	999
	As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,	999
	Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.	999
	999
LYSANDER	A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.	999
	I have a widow aunt, a dowager	999
	Of great revenue, and she hath no child:	999
	From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;	999
	And she respects me as her only son.	999
	There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;	999
	And to that place the sharp Athenian law	999
	Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,	999
	Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;	999
	And in the wood, a league without the town,	999
	Where I did meet thee once with Helena,	999
	To do observance to a morn of May,	999
	There will I stay for thee.	999
	999
HERMIA	My good Lysander!	999
	I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,	999
	By his best arrow with the golden head,	999
	By the simplicity of Venus' doves,	999
	By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,	999
	And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,	999
	When the false Troyan under sail was seen,	999
	By all the vows that ever men have broke,	999
	In number more than ever women spoke,	999
	In that same place thou hast appointed me,	999
	To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.	999
	999
	[Enter HELENA]	999
	999
HERMIA	God speed fair Helena! whither away?	999
	999
HELENA	Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.	999
	Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!	999
	Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air	999
	More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,	999
	When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.	999
	Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,	999
	Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;	999
	My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,	999
	My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.	999
	Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,	999
	The rest I'd give to be to you translated.	999
	O, teach me how you look, and with what art	999
	You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.	999
	999
HERMIA	I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.	999
	999
HELENA	O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!	999
	999
HERMIA	I give him curses, yet he gives me love.	999
	999
HELENA	O that my prayers could such affection move!	999
	999
HERMIA	The more I hate, the more he follows me.	999
	999
HELENA	The more I love, the more he hateth me.	999
	999
HERMIA	His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.	999
	999
HELENA	None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!	999
	999
HERMIA	Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;	999
	Lysander and myself will fly this place.	999
	Before the time I did Lysander see,	999
	Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:	999
	O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,	999
	That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!	999
	999
LYSANDER	Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:	999
	To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold	999
	Her silver visage in the watery glass,	999
	Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,	999
	A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,	999
	Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.	999
	999
HERMIA	And in the wood, where often you and I	999
	Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,	999
	Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,	999
	There my Lysander and myself shall meet;	999
	And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,	999
	To seek new friends and stranger companies.	999
	Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;	999
	And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!	999
	Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight	999
	From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.	999
	999
LYSANDER	I will, my Hermia.	999
	999
	[Exit HERMIA]	999
	999
	Helena, adieu:	999
	As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HELENA	How happy some o'er other some can be!	999
	Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.	999
	But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;	999
	He will not know what all but he do know:	999
	And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,	999
	So I, admiring of his qualities:	999
	Things base and vile, folding no quantity,	999
	Love can transpose to form and dignity:	999
	Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;	999
	And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:	999
	Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;	999
	Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:	999
	And therefore is Love said to be a child,	999
	Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.	999
	As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,	999
	So the boy Love is perjured every where:	999
	For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,	999
	He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;	999
	And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,	999
	So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.	999
	I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:	999
	Then to the wood will he to-morrow night	999
	Pursue her; and for this intelligence	999
	If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:	999
	But herein mean I to enrich my pain,	999
	To have his sight thither and back again.	999

	A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Athens. QUINCE'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and	999
	STARVELING]	999
	999
QUINCE	Is all our company here?	999
	999
BOTTOM	You were best to call them generally, man by man,	999
	according to the scrip.	999
	999
QUINCE	Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is	999
	thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our	999
	interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his	999
	wedding-day at night.	999
	999
BOTTOM	First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats	999
	on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow	999
	to a point.	999
	999
QUINCE	Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and	999
	most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.	999
	999
BOTTOM	A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a	999
	merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your	999
	actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.	999
	999
QUINCE	Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.	999
	999
QUINCE	You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.	999
	999
BOTTOM	What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?	999
	999
QUINCE	A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.	999
	999
BOTTOM	That will ask some tears in the true performing of	999
	it: if I do it, let the audience look to their	999
	eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some	999
	measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a	999
	tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to	999
	tear a cat in, to make all split.	999
	The raging rocks	999
	And shivering shocks	999
	Shall break the locks	999
	Of prison gates;	999
	And Phibbus' car	999
	Shall shine from far	999
	And make and mar	999
	The foolish Fates.	999
	This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.	999
	This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is	999
	more condoling.	999
	999
QUINCE	Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.	999
	999
FLUTE	Here, Peter Quince.	999
	999
QUINCE	Flute, you must take Thisby on you.	999
	999
FLUTE	What is Thisby? a wandering knight?	999
	999
QUINCE	It is the lady that Pyramus must love.	999
	999
FLUTE	Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.	999
	999
QUINCE	That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and	999
	you may speak as small as you will.	999
	999
BOTTOM	An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll	999
	speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,	999
	Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,	999
	and lady dear!'	999
	999
QUINCE	No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Well, proceed.	999
	999
QUINCE	Robin Starveling, the tailor.	999
	999
STARVELING	Here, Peter Quince.	999
	999
QUINCE	Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.	999
	Tom Snout, the tinker.	999
	999
SNOUT	Here, Peter Quince.	999
	999
QUINCE	You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:	999
	Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I	999
	hope, here is a play fitted.	999
	999
SNUG	Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it	999
	be, give it me, for I am slow of study.	999
	999
QUINCE	You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will	999
	do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,	999
	that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,	999
	let him roar again.'	999
	999
QUINCE	An you should do it too terribly, you would fright	999
	the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;	999
	and that were enough to hang us all.	999
	999
ALL	That would hang us, every mother's son.	999
	999
BOTTOM	I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the	999
	ladies out of their wits, they would have no more	999
	discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my	999
	voice so that I will roar you as gently as any	999
	sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any	999
	nightingale.	999
	999
QUINCE	You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a	999
	sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a	999
	summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:	999
	therefore you must needs play Pyramus.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best	999
	to play it in?	999
	999
QUINCE	Why, what you will.	999
	999
BOTTOM	I will discharge it in either your straw-colour	999
	beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain	999
	beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your	999
	perfect yellow.	999
	999
QUINCE	Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and	999
	then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here	999
	are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request	999
	you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;	999
	and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the	999
	town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if	999
	we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with	999
	company, and our devices known. In the meantime I	999
	will draw a bill of properties, such as our play	999
	wants. I pray you, fail me not.	999
	999
BOTTOM	We will meet; and there we may rehearse most	999
	obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.	999
	999
QUINCE	At the duke's oak we meet.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

	A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	999
	999
	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A wood near Athens.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter, from opposite sides, a Fairy, and PUCK]	999
	999
PUCK	How now, spirit! whither wander you?	999
	999
Fairy	     Over hill, over dale,	999
	Thorough bush, thorough brier,	999
	Over park, over pale,	999
	Thorough flood, thorough fire,	999
	I do wander everywhere,	999
	Swifter than the moon's sphere;	999
	And I serve the fairy queen,	999
	To dew her orbs upon the green.	999
	The cowslips tall her pensioners be:	999
	In their gold coats spots you see;	999
	Those be rubies, fairy favours,	999
	In those freckles live their savours:	999
	I must go seek some dewdrops here	999
	And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.	999
	Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:	999
	Our queen and all our elves come here anon.	999
	999
PUCK	The king doth keep his revels here to-night:	999
	Take heed the queen come not within his sight;	999
	For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,	999
	Because that she as her attendant hath	999
	A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;	999
	She never had so sweet a changeling;	999
	And jealous Oberon would have the child	999
	Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;	999
	But she perforce withholds the loved boy,	999
	Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:	999
	And now they never meet in grove or green,	999
	By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,	999
	But, they do square, that all their elves for fear	999
	Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.	999
	999
Fairy	Either I mistake your shape and making quite,	999
	Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite	999
	Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he	999
	That frights the maidens of the villagery;	999
	Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern	999
	And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;	999
	And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;	999
	Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?	999
	Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,	999
	You do their work, and they shall have good luck:	999
	Are not you he?	999
	999
PUCK	                  Thou speak'st aright;	999
	I am that merry wanderer of the night.	999
	I jest to Oberon and make him smile	999
	When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,	999
	Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:	999
	And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,	999
	In very likeness of a roasted crab,	999
	And when she drinks, against her lips I bob	999
	And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.	999
	The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,	999
	Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;	999
	Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,	999
	And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;	999
	And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,	999
	And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear	999
	A merrier hour was never wasted there.	999
	But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.	999
	999
Fairy	And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!	999
	999
	[Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train;	999
	from the other, TITANIA, with hers]	999
	999
OBERON	Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.	999
	999
TITANIA	What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:	999
	I have forsworn his bed and company.	999
	999
OBERON	Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?	999
	999
TITANIA	Then I must be thy lady: but I know	999
	When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,	999
	And in the shape of Corin sat all day,	999
	Playing on pipes of corn and versing love	999
	To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,	999
	Come from the farthest Steppe of India?	999
	But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,	999
	Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,	999
	To Theseus must be wedded, and you come	999
	To give their bed joy and prosperity.	999
	999
OBERON	How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,	999
	Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,	999
	Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?	999
	Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night	999
	From Perigenia, whom he ravished?	999
	And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,	999
	With Ariadne and Antiopa?	999
	999
TITANIA	These are the forgeries of jealousy:	999
	And never, since the middle summer's spring,	999
	Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,	999
	By paved fountain or by rushy brook,	999
	Or in the beached margent of the sea,	999
	To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,	999
	But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.	999
	Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,	999
	As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea	999
	Contagious fogs; which falling in the land	999
	Have every pelting river made so proud	999
	That they have overborne their continents:	999
	The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,	999
	The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn	999
	Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;	999
	The fold stands empty in the drowned field,	999
	And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;	999
	The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,	999
	And the quaint mazes in the wanton green	999
	For lack of tread are undistinguishable:	999
	The human mortals want their winter here;	999
	No night is now with hymn or carol blest:	999
	Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,	999
	Pale in her anger, washes all the air,	999
	That rheumatic diseases do abound:	999
	And thorough this distemperature we see	999
	The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts	999
	Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,	999
	And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown	999
	An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds	999
	Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,	999
	The childing autumn, angry winter, change	999
	Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,	999
	By their increase, now knows not which is which:	999
	And this same progeny of evils comes	999
	From our debate, from our dissension;	999
	We are their parents and original.	999
	999
OBERON	Do you amend it then; it lies in you:	999
	Why should Titania cross her Oberon?	999
	I do but beg a little changeling boy,	999
	To be my henchman.	999
	999
TITANIA	                  Set your heart at rest:	999
	The fairy land buys not the child of me.	999
	His mother was a votaress of my order:	999
	And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,	999
	Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,	999
	And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,	999
	Marking the embarked traders on the flood,	999
	When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive	999
	And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;	999
	Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait	999
	Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--	999
	Would imitate, and sail upon the land,	999
	To fetch me trifles, and return again,	999
	As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.	999
	But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;	999
	And for her sake do I rear up her boy,	999
	And for her sake I will not part with him.	999
	999
OBERON	How long within this wood intend you stay?	999
	999
TITANIA	Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.	999
	If you will patiently dance in our round	999
	And see our moonlight revels, go with us;	999
	If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.	999
	999
OBERON	Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.	999
	999
TITANIA	Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!	999
	We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.	999
	999
	[Exit TITANIA with her train]	999
	999
OBERON	Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove	999
	Till I torment thee for this injury.	999
	My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest	999
	Since once I sat upon a promontory,	999
	And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back	999
	Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath	999
	That the rude sea grew civil at her song	999
	And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,	999
	To hear the sea-maid's music.	999
	999
PUCK	I remember.	999
	999
OBERON	That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,	999
	Flying between the cold moon and the earth,	999
	Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took	999
	At a fair vestal throned by the west,	999
	And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,	999
	As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;	999
	But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft	999
	Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,	999
	And the imperial votaress passed on,	999
	In maiden meditation, fancy-free.	999
	Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:	999
	It fell upon a little western flower,	999
	Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,	999
	And maidens call it love-in-idleness.	999
	Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:	999
	The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid	999
	Will make or man or woman madly dote	999
	Upon the next live creature that it sees.	999
	Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again	999
	Ere the leviathan can swim a league.	999
	999
PUCK	I'll put a girdle round about the earth	999
	In forty minutes.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
OBERON	                  Having once this juice,	999
	I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,	999
	And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.	999
	The next thing then she waking looks upon,	999
	Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,	999
	On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,	999
	She shall pursue it with the soul of love:	999
	And ere I take this charm from off her sight,	999
	As I can take it with another herb,	999
	I'll make her render up her page to me.	999
	But who comes here? I am invisible;	999
	And I will overhear their conference.	999
	999
	[Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him]	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.	999
	Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?	999
	The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.	999
	Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;	999
	And here am I, and wode within this wood,	999
	Because I cannot meet my Hermia.	999
	Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.	999
	999
HELENA	You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;	999
	But yet you draw not iron, for my heart	999
	Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,	999
	And I shall have no power to follow you.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?	999
	Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth	999
	Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?	999
	999
HELENA	And even for that do I love you the more.	999
	I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,	999
	The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:	999
	Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,	999
	Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,	999
	Unworthy as I am, to follow you.	999
	What worser place can I beg in your love,--	999
	And yet a place of high respect with me,--	999
	Than to be used as you use your dog?	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;	999
	For I am sick when I do look on thee.	999
	999
HELENA	And I am sick when I look not on you.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	You do impeach your modesty too much,	999
	To leave the city and commit yourself	999
	Into the hands of one that loves you not;	999
	To trust the opportunity of night	999
	And the ill counsel of a desert place	999
	With the rich worth of your virginity.	999
	999
HELENA	Your virtue is my privilege: for that	999
	It is not night when I do see your face,	999
	Therefore I think I am not in the night;	999
	Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,	999
	For you in my respect are all the world:	999
	Then how can it be said I am alone,	999
	When all the world is here to look on me?	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,	999
	And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.	999
	999
HELENA	The wildest hath not such a heart as you.	999
	Run when you will, the story shall be changed:	999
	Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;	999
	The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind	999
	Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,	999
	When cowardice pursues and valour flies.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	I will not stay thy questions; let me go:	999
	Or, if thou follow me, do not believe	999
	But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.	999
	999
HELENA	Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,	999
	You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!	999
	Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:	999
	We cannot fight for love, as men may do;	999
	We should be wood and were not made to woo.	999
	999
	[Exit DEMETRIUS]	999
	999
	I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,	999
	To die upon the hand I love so well.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
OBERON	Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,	999
	Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.	999
	999
	[Re-enter PUCK]	999
	999
	Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.	999
	999
PUCK	Ay, there it is.	999
	999
OBERON	I pray thee, give it me.	999
	I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,	999
	Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,	999
	Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,	999
	With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:	999
	There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,	999
	Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;	999
	And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,	999
	Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:	999
	And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,	999
	And make her full of hateful fantasies.	999
	Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:	999
	A sweet Athenian lady is in love	999
	With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;	999
	But do it when the next thing he espies	999
	May be the lady: thou shalt know the man	999
	By the Athenian garments he hath on.	999
	Effect it with some care, that he may prove	999
	More fond on her than she upon her love:	999
	And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.	999
	999
PUCK	Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.	999
	999

	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Another part of the wood.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter TITANIA, with her train]	999
	999
TITANIA	Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;	999
	Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;	999
	Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,	999
	Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,	999
	To make my small elves coats, and some keep back	999
	The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders	999
	At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;	999
	Then to your offices and let me rest.	999
	999
	[The Fairies sing]	999
	999
	You spotted snakes with double tongue,	999
	Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;	999
	Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,	999
	Come not near our fairy queen.	999
	Philomel, with melody	999
	Sing in our sweet lullaby;	999
	Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:	999
	Never harm,	999
	Nor spell nor charm,	999
	Come our lovely lady nigh;	999
	So, good night, with lullaby.	999
	Weaving spiders, come not here;	999
	Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!	999
	Beetles black, approach not near;	999
	Worm nor snail, do no offence.	999
	Philomel, with melody, &c.	999
	999
Fairy	Hence, away! now all is well:	999
	One aloof stand sentinel.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps]	999
	999
	[Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids]	999
	999
OBERON	What thou seest when thou dost wake,	999
	Do it for thy true-love take,	999
	Love and languish for his sake:	999
	Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,	999
	Pard, or boar with bristled hair,	999
	In thy eye that shall appear	999
	When thou wakest, it is thy dear:	999
	Wake when some vile thing is near.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA]	999
	999
LYSANDER	Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;	999
	And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:	999
	We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,	999
	And tarry for the comfort of the day.	999
	999
HERMIA	Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;	999
	For I upon this bank will rest my head.	999
	999
LYSANDER	One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;	999
	One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.	999
	999
HERMIA	Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,	999
	Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.	999
	999
LYSANDER	O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!	999
	Love takes the meaning in love's conference.	999
	I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit	999
	So that but one heart we can make of it;	999
	Two bosoms interchained with an oath;	999
	So then two bosoms and a single troth.	999
	Then by your side no bed-room me deny;	999
	For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.	999
	999
HERMIA	Lysander riddles very prettily:	999
	Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,	999
	If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.	999
	But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy	999
	Lie further off; in human modesty,	999
	Such separation as may well be said	999
	Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,	999
	So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:	999
	Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!	999
	999
LYSANDER	Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;	999
	And then end life when I end loyalty!	999
	Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!	999
	999
HERMIA	With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!	999
	999
	[They sleep]	999
	999
	[Enter PUCK]	999
	999
PUCK	Through the forest have I gone.	999
	But Athenian found I none,	999
	On whose eyes I might approve	999
	This flower's force in stirring love.	999
	Night and silence.--Who is here?	999
	Weeds of Athens he doth wear:	999
	This is he, my master said,	999
	Despised the Athenian maid;	999
	And here the maiden, sleeping sound,	999
	On the dank and dirty ground.	999
	Pretty soul! she durst not lie	999
	Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.	999
	Churl, upon thy eyes I throw	999
	All the power this charm doth owe.	999
	When thou wakest, let love forbid	999
	Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:	999
	So awake when I am gone;	999
	For I must now to Oberon.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running]	999
	999
HELENA	Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.	999
	999
HELENA	O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HELENA	O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!	999
	The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.	999
	Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;	999
	For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.	999
	How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:	999
	If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.	999
	No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;	999
	For beasts that meet me run away for fear:	999
	Therefore no marvel though Demetrius	999
	Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.	999
	What wicked and dissembling glass of mine	999
	Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?	999
	But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!	999
	Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.	999
	Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.	999
	999
LYSANDER	[Awaking]  And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.	999
	Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,	999
	That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.	999
	Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word	999
	Is that vile name to perish on my sword!	999
	999
HELENA	Do not say so, Lysander; say not so	999
	What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?	999
	Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Content with Hermia! No; I do repent	999
	The tedious minutes I with her have spent.	999
	Not Hermia but Helena I love:	999
	Who will not change a raven for a dove?	999
	The will of man is by his reason sway'd;	999
	And reason says you are the worthier maid.	999
	Things growing are not ripe until their season	999
	So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;	999
	And touching now the point of human skill,	999
	Reason becomes the marshal to my will	999
	And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook	999
	Love's stories written in love's richest book.	999
	999
HELENA	Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?	999
	When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?	999
	Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,	999
	That I did never, no, nor never can,	999
	Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,	999
	But you must flout my insufficiency?	999
	Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,	999
	In such disdainful manner me to woo.	999
	But fare you well: perforce I must confess	999
	I thought you lord of more true gentleness.	999
	O, that a lady, of one man refused.	999
	Should of another therefore be abused!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LYSANDER	She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:	999
	And never mayst thou come Lysander near!	999
	For as a surfeit of the sweetest things	999
	The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,	999
	Or as tie heresies that men do leave	999
	Are hated most of those they did deceive,	999
	So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,	999
	Of all be hated, but the most of me!	999
	And, all my powers, address your love and might	999
	To honour Helen and to be her knight!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HERMIA	[Awaking]  Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best	999
	To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!	999
	Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!	999
	Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:	999
	Methought a serpent eat my heart away,	999
	And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.	999
	Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!	999
	What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?	999
	Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;	999
	Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.	999
	No? then I well perceive you all not nigh	999
	Either death or you I'll find immediately.	999
	999

	A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	999
	999
	999
ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and	999
	STARVELING]	999
	999
BOTTOM	Are we all met?	999
	999
QUINCE	Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place	999
	for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our	999
	stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we	999
	will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Peter Quince,--	999
	999
QUINCE	What sayest thou, bully Bottom?	999
	999
BOTTOM	There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and	999
	Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must	999
	draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies	999
	cannot abide. How answer you that?	999
	999
SNOUT	By'r lakin, a parlous fear.	999
	999
STARVELING	I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.	999
	Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to	999
	say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that	999
	Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more	999
	better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not	999
	Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them	999
	out of fear.	999
	999
QUINCE	Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be	999
	written in eight and six.	999
	999
BOTTOM	No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.	999
	999
SNOUT	Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?	999
	999
STARVELING	I fear it, I promise you.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to	999
	bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a	999
	most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful	999
	wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to	999
	look to 't.	999
	999
SNOUT	Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must	999
	be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself	999
	must speak through, saying thus, or to the same	999
	defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish	999
	You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would	999
	entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life	999
	for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it	999
	were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a	999
	man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name	999
	his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.	999
	999
QUINCE	Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;	999
	that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,	999
	you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.	999
	999
SNOUT	Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?	999
	999
BOTTOM	A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find	999
	out moonshine, find out moonshine.	999
	999
QUINCE	Yes, it doth shine that night.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Why, then may you leave a casement of the great	999
	chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon	999
	may shine in at the casement.	999
	999
QUINCE	Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns	999
	and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to	999
	present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is	999
	another thing: we must have a wall in the great	999
	chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did	999
	talk through the chink of a wall.	999
	999
SNOUT	You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?	999
	999
BOTTOM	Some man or other must present Wall: and let him	999
	have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast	999
	about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his	999
	fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus	999
	and Thisby whisper.	999
	999
QUINCE	If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,	999
	every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.	999
	Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your	999
	speech, enter into that brake: and so every one	999
	according to his cue.	999
	999
	[Enter PUCK behind]	999
	999
PUCK	What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,	999
	So near the cradle of the fairy queen?	999
	What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;	999
	An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.	999
	999
QUINCE	Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--	999
	999
QUINCE	Odours, odours.	999
	999
BOTTOM	--odours savours sweet:	999
	So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.	999
	But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,	999
	And by and by I will to thee appear.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PUCK	A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FLUTE	Must I speak now?	999
	999
QUINCE	Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes	999
	but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.	999
	999
FLUTE	Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,	999
	Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,	999
	Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,	999
	As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,	999
	I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.	999
	999
QUINCE	'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that	999
	yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your	999
	part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue	999
	is past; it is, 'never tire.'	999
	999
FLUTE	O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would	999
	never tire.	999
	999
	[Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head]	999
	999
BOTTOM	If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.	999
	999
QUINCE	O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,	999
	masters! fly, masters! Help!	999
	999
	[Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING]	999
	999
PUCK	I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,	999
	Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:	999
	Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,	999
	A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;	999
	And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,	999
	Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BOTTOM	Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to	999
	make me afeard.	999
	999
	[Re-enter SNOUT]	999
	999
SNOUT	O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?	999
	999
BOTTOM	What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do	999
	you?	999
	999
	[Exit SNOUT]	999
	999
	[Re-enter QUINCE]	999
	999
QUINCE	Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art	999
	translated.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BOTTOM	I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;	999
	to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir	999
	from this place, do what they can: I will walk up	999
	and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear	999
	I am not afraid.	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	The ousel cock so black of hue,	999
	With orange-tawny bill,	999
	The throstle with his note so true,	999
	The wren with little quill,--	999
	999
TITANIA	[Awaking]  What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?	999
	999
BOTTOM	[Sings]	999
	999
	The finch, the sparrow and the lark,	999
	The plain-song cuckoo gray,	999
	Whose note full many a man doth mark,	999
	And dares not answer nay;--	999
	for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish	999
	a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry	999
	'cuckoo' never so?	999
	999
TITANIA	I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:	999
	Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;	999
	So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;	999
	And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me	999
	On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason	999
	for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and	999
	love keep little company together now-a-days; the	999
	more the pity that some honest neighbours will not	999
	make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.	999
	999
TITANIA	Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out	999
	of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.	999
	999
TITANIA	Out of this wood do not desire to go:	999
	Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.	999
	I am a spirit of no common rate;	999
	The summer still doth tend upon my state;	999
	And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;	999
	I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,	999
	And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,	999
	And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;	999
	And I will purge thy mortal grossness so	999
	That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.	999
	Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!	999
	999
	[Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED]	999

MUSTARDSEED	                  And I.	999
	999
ALL	Where shall we go?	999
	999
TITANIA	Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;	999
	Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;	999
	Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,	999
	With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;	999
	The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,	999
	And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs	999
	And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,	999
	To have my love to bed and to arise;	999
	And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies	999
	To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:	999
	Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.	999
	999
PEASEBLOSSOM	Hail, mortal!	999
	999
COBWEB	Hail!	999

MOTH	Hail!	999

	999
COBWEB	Cobweb.	999
	999
BOTTOM	I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master	999
	Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with	999
	you. Your name, honest gentleman?	999
	999
PEASEBLOSSOM	Peaseblossom.	999
	999
BOTTOM	I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your	999
	mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good	999
	Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more	999
	acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?	999
	999
MUSTARDSEED	Mustardseed.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:	999
	that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath	999
	devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise	999
	you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I	999
	desire your more acquaintance, good Master	999
	Mustardseed.	999
	999
TITANIA	Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.	999
	The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;	999
	And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,	999
	Lamenting some enforced chastity.	999
	Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.	999

	A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	999
	999
	999
ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Another part of the wood.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter OBERON]	999
	999
OBERON	I wonder if Titania be awaked;	999
	Then, what it was that next came in her eye,	999
	Which she must dote on in extremity.	999
	999
	[Enter PUCK]	999
	999
	Here comes my messenger.	999
		   How now, mad spirit!	999
	What night-rule now about this haunted grove?	999
	999
PUCK	My mistress with a monster is in love.	999
	Near to her close and consecrated bower,	999
	While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,	999
	A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,	999
	That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,	999
	Were met together to rehearse a play	999
	Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.	999
	The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,	999
	Who Pyramus presented, in their sport	999
	Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake	999
	When I did him at this advantage take,	999
	An ass's nole I fixed on his head:	999
	Anon his Thisbe must be answered,	999
	And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,	999
	As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,	999
	Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,	999
	Rising and cawing at the gun's report,	999
	Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,	999
	So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;	999
	And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;	999
	He murder cries and help from Athens calls.	999
	Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears	999
	thus strong,	999
	Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;	999
	For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;	999
	Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all	999
	things catch.	999
	I led them on in this distracted fear,	999
	And left sweet Pyramus translated there:	999
	When in that moment, so it came to pass,	999
	Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.	999
	999
OBERON	This falls out better than I could devise.	999
	But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes	999
	With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?	999
	999
PUCK	I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--	999
	And the Athenian woman by his side:	999
	That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.	999
	999
	[Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS]	999
	999
OBERON	Stand close: this is the same Athenian.	999
	999
PUCK	This is the woman, but not this the man.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?	999
	Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.	999
	999
HERMIA	Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,	999
	For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,	999
	If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,	999
	Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,	999
	And kill me too.	999
	The sun was not so true unto the day	999
	As he to me: would he have stolen away	999
	From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon	999
	This whole earth may be bored and that the moon	999
	May through the centre creep and so displease	999
	Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.	999
	It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;	999
	So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	So should the murder'd look, and so should I,	999
	Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:	999
	Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,	999
	As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.	999
	999
HERMIA	What's this to my Lysander? where is he?	999
	Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.	999
	999
HERMIA	Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds	999
	Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?	999
	Henceforth be never number'd among men!	999
	O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!	999
	Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,	999
	And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!	999
	Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?	999
	An adder did it; for with doubler tongue	999
	Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	You spend your passion on a misprised mood:	999
	I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;	999
	Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.	999
	999
HERMIA	I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	An if I could, what should I get therefore?	999
	999
HERMIA	A privilege never to see me more.	999
	And from thy hated presence part I so:	999
	See me no more, whether he be dead or no.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	There is no following her in this fierce vein:	999
	Here therefore for a while I will remain.	999
	So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow	999
	For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:	999
	Which now in some slight measure it will pay,	999
	If for his tender here I make some stay.	999
	999
	[Lies down and sleeps]	999
	999
OBERON	What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite	999
	And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:	999
	Of thy misprision must perforce ensue	999
	Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.	999
	999
PUCK	Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,	999
	A million fail, confounding oath on oath.	999
	999
OBERON	About the wood go swifter than the wind,	999
	And Helena of Athens look thou find:	999
	All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,	999
	With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:	999
	By some illusion see thou bring her here:	999
	I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.	999
	999
PUCK	I go, I go; look how I go,	999
	Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
OBERON	   Flower of this purple dye,	999
	Hit with Cupid's archery,	999
	Sink in apple of his eye.	999
	When his love he doth espy,	999
	Let her shine as gloriously	999
	As the Venus of the sky.	999
	When thou wakest, if she be by,	999
	Beg of her for remedy.	999
	999
	[Re-enter PUCK]	999
	999
PUCK	   Captain of our fairy band,	999
	Helena is here at hand;	999
	And the youth, mistook by me,	999
	Pleading for a lover's fee.	999
	Shall we their fond pageant see?	999
	Lord, what fools these mortals be!	999
	999
OBERON	Stand aside: the noise they make	999
	Will cause Demetrius to awake.	999
	999
PUCK	Then will two at once woo one;	999
	That must needs be sport alone;	999
	And those things do best please me	999
	That befal preposterously.	999
	999
	[Enter LYSANDER and HELENA]	999
	999
LYSANDER	Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?	999
	Scorn and derision never come in tears:	999
	Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,	999
	In their nativity all truth appears.	999
	How can these things in me seem scorn to you,	999
	Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?	999
	999
HELENA	You do advance your cunning more and more.	999
	When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!	999
	These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?	999
	Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:	999
	Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,	999
	Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.	999
	999
LYSANDER	I had no judgment when to her I swore.	999
	999
HELENA	Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	[Awaking]  O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!	999
	To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?	999
	Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show	999
	Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!	999
	That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,	999
	Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow	999
	When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss	999
	This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!	999
	999
HELENA	O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent	999
	To set against me for your merriment:	999
	If you we re civil and knew courtesy,	999
	You would not do me thus much injury.	999
	Can you not hate me, as I know you do,	999
	But you must join in souls to mock me too?	999
	If you were men, as men you are in show,	999
	You would not use a gentle lady so;	999
	To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,	999
	When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.	999
	You both are rivals, and love Hermia;	999
	And now both rivals, to mock Helena:	999
	A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,	999
	To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes	999
	With your derision! none of noble sort	999
	Would so offend a virgin, and extort	999
	A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.	999
	999
LYSANDER	You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;	999
	For you love Hermia; this you know I know:	999
	And here, with all good will, with all my heart,	999
	In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;	999
	And yours of Helena to me bequeath,	999
	Whom I do love and will do till my death.	999
	999
HELENA	Never did mockers waste more idle breath.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:	999
	If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.	999
	My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,	999
	And now to Helen is it home return'd,	999
	There to remain.	999
	999
LYSANDER	                  Helen, it is not so.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,	999
	Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.	999
	Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.	999
	999
	[Re-enter HERMIA]	999
	999
HERMIA	Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,	999
	The ear more quick of apprehension makes;	999
	Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,	999
	It pays the hearing double recompense.	999
	Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;	999
	Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound	999
	But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?	999
	999
LYSANDER	Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?	999
	999
HERMIA	What love could press Lysander from my side?	999
	999
LYSANDER	Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,	999
	Fair Helena, who more engilds the night	999
	Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.	999
	Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,	999
	The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?	999
	999
HERMIA	You speak not as you think: it cannot be.	999
	999
HELENA	Lo, she is one of this confederacy!	999
	Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three	999
	To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.	999
	Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!	999
	Have you conspired, have you with these contrived	999
	To bait me with this foul derision?	999
	Is all the counsel that we two have shared,	999
	The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,	999
	When we have chid the hasty-footed time	999
	For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?	999
	All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?	999
	We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,	999
	Have with our needles created both one flower,	999
	Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,	999
	Both warbling of one song, both in one key,	999
	As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,	999
	Had been incorporate. So we grow together,	999
	Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,	999
	But yet an union in partition;	999
	Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;	999
	So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;	999
	Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,	999
	Due but to one and crowned with one crest.	999
	And will you rent our ancient love asunder,	999
	To join with men in scorning your poor friend?	999
	It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:	999
	Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,	999
	Though I alone do feel the injury.	999
	999
HERMIA	I am amazed at your passionate words.	999
	I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.	999
	999
HELENA	Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,	999
	To follow me and praise my eyes and face?	999
	And made your other love, Demetrius,	999
	Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,	999
	To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,	999
	Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this	999
	To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander	999
	Deny your love, so rich within his soul,	999
	And tender me, forsooth, affection,	999
	But by your setting on, by your consent?	999
	What thought I be not so in grace as you,	999
	So hung upon with love, so fortunate,	999
	But miserable most, to love unloved?	999
	This you should pity rather than despise.	999
	999
HERNIA	I understand not what you mean by this.	999
	999
HELENA	Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,	999
	Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;	999
	Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:	999
	This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.	999
	If you have any pity, grace, or manners,	999
	You would not make me such an argument.	999
	But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;	999
	Which death or absence soon shall remedy.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:	999
	My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!	999
	999
HELENA	O excellent!	999
	999
HERMIA	                  Sweet, do not scorn her so.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	If she cannot entreat, I can compel.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:	999
	Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.	999
	Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:	999
	I swear by that which I will lose for thee,	999
	To prove him false that says I love thee not.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	I say I love thee more than he can do.	999
	999
LYSANDER	If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Quick, come!	999
	999
HERMIA	Lysander, whereto tends all this?	999
	999
LYSANDER	Away, you Ethiope!	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	                  No, no; he'll [        ]	999
	Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,	999
	But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!	999
	999
LYSANDER	Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,	999
	Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!	999
	999
HERMIA	Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?	999
	Sweet love,--	999
	999
LYSANDER	Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!	999
	Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!	999
	999
HERMIA	Do you not jest?	999
	999
HELENA	Yes, sooth; and so do you.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	I would I had your bond, for I perceive	999
	A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.	999
	999
LYSANDER	What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?	999
	Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.	999
	999
HERMIA	What, can you do me greater harm than hate?	999
	Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!	999
	Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?	999
	I am as fair now as I was erewhile.	999
	Since night you loved me; yet since night you left	999
	me:	999
	Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--	999
	In earnest, shall I say?	999
	999
LYSANDER	Ay, by my life;	999
	And never did desire to see thee more.	999
	Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;	999
	Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest	999
	That I do hate thee and love Helena.	999
	999
HERMIA	O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!	999
	You thief of love! what, have you come by night	999
	And stolen my love's heart from him?	999
	999
HELENA	Fine, i'faith!	999
	Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,	999
	No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear	999
	Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?	999
	Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!	999
	999
HERMIA	Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.	999
	Now I perceive that she hath made compare	999
	Between our statures; she hath urged her height;	999
	And with her personage, her tall personage,	999
	Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.	999
	And are you grown so high in his esteem;	999
	Because I am so dwarfish and so low?	999
	How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;	999
	How low am I? I am not yet so low	999
	But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.	999
	999
HELENA	I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,	999
	Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;	999
	I have no gift at all in shrewishness;	999
	I am a right maid for my cowardice:	999
	Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,	999
	Because she is something lower than myself,	999
	That I can match her.	999
	999
HERMIA	Lower! hark, again.	999
	999
HELENA	Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.	999
	I evermore did love you, Hermia,	999
	Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;	999
	Save that, in love unto Demetrius,	999
	I told him of your stealth unto this wood.	999
	He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;	999
	But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me	999
	To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:	999
	And now, so you will let me quiet go,	999
	To Athens will I bear my folly back	999
	And follow you no further: let me go:	999
	You see how simple and how fond I am.	999
	999
HERMIA	Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?	999
	999
HELENA	A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.	999
	999
HERMIA	What, with Lysander?	999
	999
HELENA	With Demetrius.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.	999
	999
HELENA	O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!	999
	She was a vixen when she went to school;	999
	And though she be but little, she is fierce.	999
	999
HERMIA	'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!	999
	Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?	999
	Let me come to her.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Get you gone, you dwarf;	999
	You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;	999
	You bead, you acorn.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	You are too officious	999
	In her behalf that scorns your services.	999
	Let her alone: speak not of Helena;	999
	Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend	999
	Never so little show of love to her,	999
	Thou shalt aby it.	999
	999
LYSANDER	                  Now she holds me not;	999
	Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,	999
	Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.	999
	999
	[Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS]	999
	999
HERMIA	You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:	999
	Nay, go not back.	999
	999
HELENA	                  I will not trust you, I,	999
	Nor longer stay in your curst company.	999
	Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,	999
	My legs are longer though, to run away.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HERMIA	I am amazed, and know not what to say.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
OBERON	This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,	999
	Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.	999
	999
PUCK	Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.	999
	Did not you tell me I should know the man	999
	By the Athenian garment be had on?	999
	And so far blameless proves my enterprise,	999
	That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;	999
	And so far am I glad it so did sort	999
	As this their jangling I esteem a sport.	999
	999
OBERON	Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:	999
	Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;	999
	The starry welkin cover thou anon	999
	With drooping fog as black as Acheron,	999
	And lead these testy rivals so astray	999
	As one come not within another's way.	999
	Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,	999
	Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;	999
	And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;	999
	And from each other look thou lead them thus,	999
	Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep	999
	With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:	999
	Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;	999
	Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,	999
	To take from thence all error with his might,	999
	And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.	999
	When they next wake, all this derision	999
	Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,	999
	And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,	999
	With league whose date till death shall never end.	999
	Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,	999
	I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;	999
	And then I will her charmed eye release	999
	From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.	999
	999
PUCK	My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,	999
	For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,	999
	And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;	999
	At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,	999
	Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,	999
	That in crossways and floods have burial,	999
	Already to their wormy beds are gone;	999
	For fear lest day should look their shames upon,	999
	They willfully themselves exile from light	999
	And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.	999
	999
OBERON	But we are spirits of another sort:	999
	I with the morning's love have oft made sport,	999
	And, like a forester, the groves may tread,	999
	Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,	999
	Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,	999
	Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.	999
	But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:	999
	We may effect this business yet ere day.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PUCK	   Up and down, up and down,	999
	I will lead them up and down:	999
	I am fear'd in field and town:	999
	Goblin, lead them up and down.	999
	Here comes one.	999
	999
	[Re-enter LYSANDER]	999
	999
LYSANDER	Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.	999
	999
PUCK	Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?	999
	999
LYSANDER	I will be with thee straight.	999
	999
PUCK	Follow me, then,	999
	To plainer ground.	999
	999
	[Exit LYSANDER, as following the voice]	999
	999
	[Re-enter DEMETRIUS]	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	                  Lysander! speak again:	999
	Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?	999
	Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?	999
	999
PUCK	Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,	999
	Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,	999
	And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;	999
	I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled	999
	That draws a sword on thee.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Yea, art thou there?	999
	999
PUCK	Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Re-enter LYSANDER]	999
	999
LYSANDER	He goes before me and still dares me on:	999
	When I come where he calls, then he is gone.	999
	The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:	999
	I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;	999
	That fallen am I in dark uneven way,	999
	And here will rest me.	999
	999
	[Lies down]	999
	999
	Come, thou gentle day!	999
	For if but once thou show me thy grey light,	999
	I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.	999
	999
	[Sleeps]	999
	999
	[Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS]	999
	999
PUCK	Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot	999
	Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,	999
	And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.	999
	Where art thou now?	999
	999
PUCK	Come hither: I am here.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,	999
	If ever I thy face by daylight see:	999
	Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me	999
	To measure out my length on this cold bed.	999
	By day's approach look to be visited.	999
	999
	[Lies down and sleeps]	999
	999
	[Re-enter HELENA]	999
	999
HELENA	O weary night, O long and tedious night,	999
	Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,	999
	That I may back to Athens by daylight,	999
	From these that my poor company detest:	999
	And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,	999
	Steal me awhile from mine own company.	999
	999
	[Lies down and sleeps]	999
	999
PUCK	Yet but three? Come one more;	999
	Two of both kinds make up four.	999
	Here she comes, curst and sad:	999
	Cupid is a knavish lad,	999
	Thus to make poor females mad.	999
	999
	[Re-enter HERMIA]	999
	999
HERMIA	Never so weary, never so in woe,	999
	Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,	999
	I can no further crawl, no further go;	999
	My legs can keep no pace with my desires.	999
	Here will I rest me till the break of day.	999
	Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!	999
	999
	[Lies down and sleeps]	999
	999
PUCK	                  On the ground	999
	Sleep sound:	999
	I'll apply	999
	To your eye,	999
	Gentle lover, remedy.	999
	999
	[Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER's eyes]	999
	999
	When thou wakest,	999
	Thou takest	999
	True delight	999
	In the sight	999
	Of thy former lady's eye:	999
	And the country proverb known,	999
	That every man should take his own,	999
	In your waking shall be shown:	999
	Jack shall have Jill;	999
	Nought shall go ill;	999
	The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.	999

	A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM	999
	999
	999
ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The same. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA	999
	lying asleep.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM; PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH,	999
	MUSTARDSEED, and other Fairies attending; OBERON	999
	behind unseen]	999
	999
TITANIA	Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,	999
	While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,	999
	And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,	999
	And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Where's Peaseblossom?	999
	999
PEASEBLOSSOM	Ready.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?	999
	999
COBWEB	Ready.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your	999
	weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped	999
	humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good	999
	mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret	999
	yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,	999
	good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;	999
	I would be loath to have you overflown with a	999
	honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?	999
	999
MUSTARDSEED	Ready.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,	999
	leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.	999
	999
MUSTARDSEED	What's your Will?	999
	999
BOTTOM	Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb	999
	to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for	999
	methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I	999
	am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,	999
	I must scratch.	999
	999
TITANIA	What, wilt thou hear some music,	999
	my sweet love?	999
	999
BOTTOM	I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have	999
	the tongs and the bones.	999
	999
TITANIA	Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good	999
	dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle	999
	of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.	999
	999
TITANIA	I have a venturous fairy that shall seek	999
	The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.	999
	999
BOTTOM	I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.	999
	But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I	999
	have an exposition of sleep come upon me.	999
	999
TITANIA	Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.	999
	Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.	999
	999
	[Exeunt fairies]	999
	999
	So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle	999
	Gently entwist; the female ivy so	999
	Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.	999
	O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!	999
	999
	[They sleep]	999
	999
	[Enter PUCK]	999
	999
OBERON	[Advancing]  Welcome, good Robin.	999
	See'st thou this sweet sight?	999
	Her dotage now I do begin to pity:	999
	For, meeting her of late behind the wood,	999
	Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,	999
	I did upbraid her and fall out with her;	999
	For she his hairy temples then had rounded	999
	With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;	999
	And that same dew, which sometime on the buds	999
	Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,	999
	Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes	999
	Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.	999
	When I had at my pleasure taunted her	999
	And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,	999
	I then did ask of her her changeling child;	999
	Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent	999
	To bear him to my bower in fairy land.	999
	And now I have the boy, I will undo	999
	This hateful imperfection of her eyes:	999
	And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp	999
	From off the head of this Athenian swain;	999
	That, he awaking when the other do,	999
	May all to Athens back again repair	999
	And think no more of this night's accidents	999
	But as the fierce vexation of a dream.	999
	But first I will release the fairy queen.	999
	Be as thou wast wont to be;	999
	See as thou wast wont to see:	999
	Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower	999
	Hath such force and blessed power.	999
	Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.	999
	999
TITANIA	My Oberon! what visions have I seen!	999
	Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.	999
	999
OBERON	There lies your love.	999
	999
TITANIA	How came these things to pass?	999
	O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!	999
	999
OBERON	Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.	999
	Titania, music call; and strike more dead	999
	Than common sleep of all these five the sense.	999
	999
TITANIA	Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!	999
	999
	[Music, still]	999
	999
PUCK	Now, when thou wakest, with thine	999
	own fool's eyes peep.	999
	999
OBERON	Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,	999
	And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.	999
	Now thou and I are new in amity,	999
	And will to-morrow midnight solemnly	999
	Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,	999
	And bless it to all fair prosperity:	999
	There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be	999
	Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.	999
	999
PUCK	Fairy king, attend, and mark:	999
	I do hear the morning lark.	999
	999
OBERON	Then, my queen, in silence sad,	999
	Trip we after the night's shade:	999
	We the globe can compass soon,	999
	Swifter than the wandering moon.	999
	999
TITANIA	Come, my lord, and in our flight	999
	Tell me how it came this night	999
	That I sleeping here was found	999
	With these mortals on the ground.	999
	999

	999
	[Horns winded within]	999
	999
	[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train]	999
	999
THESEUS	Go, one of you, find out the forester;	999
	For now our observation is perform'd;	999
	And since we have the vaward of the day,	999
	My love shall hear the music of my hounds.	999
	Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:	999
	Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.	999
	999
	[Exit an Attendant]	999
	999
	We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,	999
	And mark the musical confusion	999
	Of hounds and echo in conjunction.	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,	999
	When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear	999
	With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear	999
	Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,	999
	The skies, the fountains, every region near	999
	Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard	999
	So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.	999
	999
THESEUS	My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,	999
	So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung	999
	With ears that sweep away the morning dew;	999
	Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;	999
	Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,	999
	Each under each. A cry more tuneable	999
	Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,	999
	In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:	999
	Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?	999
	999
EGEUS	My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;	999
	And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;	999
	This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:	999
	I wonder of their being here together.	999
	999
THESEUS	No doubt they rose up early to observe	999
	The rite of May, and hearing our intent,	999
	Came here in grace our solemnity.	999
	But speak, Egeus; is not this the day	999
	That Hermia should give answer of her choice?	999
	999
EGEUS	It is, my lord.	999
	999
THESEUS	Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.	999
	999
	[Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS,	999
	HELENA, and HERMIA wake and start up]	999
	999
	Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:	999
	Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?	999
	999
LYSANDER	Pardon, my lord.	999
	999
THESEUS	                  I pray you all, stand up.	999
	I know you two are rival enemies:	999
	How comes this gentle concord in the world,	999
	That hatred is so far from jealousy,	999
	To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?	999
	999
LYSANDER	My lord, I shall reply amazedly,	999
	Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,	999
	I cannot truly say how I came here;	999
	But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,	999
	And now do I bethink me, so it is,--	999
	I came with Hermia hither: our intent	999
	Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,	999
	Without the peril of the Athenian law.	999
	999
EGEUS	Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:	999
	I beg the law, the law, upon his head.	999
	They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,	999
	Thereby to have defeated you and me,	999
	You of your wife and me of my consent,	999
	Of my consent that she should be your wife.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,	999
	Of this their purpose hither to this wood;	999
	And I in fury hither follow'd them,	999
	Fair Helena in fancy following me.	999
	But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--	999
	But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,	999
	Melted as the snow, seems to me now	999
	As the remembrance of an idle gaud	999
	Which in my childhood I did dote upon;	999
	And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,	999
	The object and the pleasure of mine eye,	999
	Is only Helena. To her, my lord,	999
	Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:	999
	But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;	999
	But, as in health, come to my natural taste,	999
	Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,	999
	And will for evermore be true to it.	999
	999
THESEUS	Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:	999
	Of this discourse we more will hear anon.	999
	Egeus, I will overbear your will;	999
	For in the temple by and by with us	999
	These couples shall eternally be knit:	999
	And, for the morning now is something worn,	999
	Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.	999
	Away with us to Athens; three and three,	999
	We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.	999
	Come, Hippolyta.	999
	999
	[Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train]	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	These things seem small and undistinguishable,	999
HERMIA	Methinks I see these things with parted eye,	999
	When every thing seems double.	999
	999
HELENA	So methinks:	999
	And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,	999
	Mine own, and not mine own.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Are you sure	999
	That we are awake? It seems to me	999
	That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think	999
	The duke was here, and bid us follow him?	999
	999
HERMIA	Yea; and my father.	999
	999
HELENA	And Hippolyta.	999
	999
LYSANDER	And he did bid us follow to the temple.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him	999
	And by the way let us recount our dreams.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
BOTTOM	[Awaking]  When my cue comes, call me, and I will	999
	answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!	999
	Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,	999
	the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen	999
	hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare	999
	vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to	999
	say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go	999
	about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there	999
	is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and	999
	methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if	999
	he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye	999
	of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not	999
	seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue	999
	to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream	999
	was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of	999
	this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,	999
	because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the	999
	latter end of a play, before the duke:	999
	peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall	999
	sing it at her death.	999

	999
QUINCE	Have you sent to Bottom's house? is he come home yet?	999
	999
STARVELING	He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is	999
	transported.	999
	999
FLUTE	If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes	999
	not forward, doth it?	999
	999
QUINCE	It is not possible: you have not a man in all	999
	Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.	999
	999
FLUTE	No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft	999
	man in Athens.	999
	999
QUINCE	Yea and the best person too; and he is a very	999
	paramour for a sweet voice.	999
	999
FLUTE	You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,	999
	a thing of naught.	999
	999
	[Enter SNUG]	999
	999
SNUG	Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and	999
	there is two or three lords and ladies more married:	999
	if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made	999
	men.	999
	999
FLUTE	O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a	999
	day during his life; he could not have 'scaped	999
	sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him	999
	sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;	999
	he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in	999
	Pyramus, or nothing.	999
	999
	[Enter BOTTOM]	999
	999
BOTTOM	Where are these lads? where are these hearts?	999
	999
QUINCE	Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!	999
	999
BOTTOM	Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not	999
	what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I	999
	will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.	999
	999
QUINCE	Let us hear, sweet Bottom.	999
	999
BOTTOM	Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that	999
	the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,	999
	good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your	999
	pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look	999
	o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our	999
	play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have	999
	clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion	999
	pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the	999
	lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions	999
	nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I	999
	do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet	999
	comedy. No more words: away! go, away!	999

ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Athens. The palace of THESEUS.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and	999
	Attendants]	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	'Tis strange my Theseus, that these	999
	lovers speak of.	999
	999
THESEUS	More strange than true: I never may believe	999
	These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.	999
	Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,	999
	Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend	999
	More than cool reason ever comprehends.	999
	The lunatic, the lover and the poet	999
	Are of imagination all compact:	999
	One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,	999
	That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,	999
	Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:	999
	The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,	999
	Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;	999
	And as imagination bodies forth	999
	The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen	999
	Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing	999
	A local habitation and a name.	999
	Such tricks hath strong imagination,	999
	That if it would but apprehend some joy,	999
	It comprehends some bringer of that joy;	999
	Or in the night, imagining some fear,	999
	How easy is a bush supposed a bear!	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	But all the story of the night told over,	999
	And all their minds transfigured so together,	999
	More witnesseth than fancy's images	999
	And grows to something of great constancy;	999
	But, howsoever, strange and admirable.	999
	999
THESEUS	Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.	999
	999
	[Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA]	999
	999
	Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love	999
	Accompany your hearts!	999
	999
LYSANDER	More than to us	999
	Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!	999
	999
THESEUS	Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,	999
	To wear away this long age of three hours	999
	Between our after-supper and bed-time?	999
	Where is our usual manager of mirth?	999
	What revels are in hand? Is there no play,	999
	To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?	999
	Call Philostrate.	999
	999
PHILOSTRATE	                  Here, mighty Theseus.	999
	999
THESEUS	Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?	999
	What masque? what music? How shall we beguile	999
	The lazy time, if not with some delight?	999
	999
PHILOSTRATE	There is a brief how many sports are ripe:	999
	Make choice of which your highness will see first.	999
	999
	[Giving a paper]	999
	999
THESEUS	[Reads]  'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung	999
	By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'	999
	We'll none of that: that have I told my love,	999
	In glory of my kinsman Hercules.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,	999
	Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'	999
	That is an old device; and it was play'd	999
	When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death	999
	Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'	999
	That is some satire, keen and critical,	999
	Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus	999
	And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'	999
	Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!	999
	That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.	999
	How shall we find the concord of this discord?	999
	999
PHILOSTRATE	A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,	999
	Which is as brief as I have known a play;	999
	But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,	999
	Which makes it tedious; for in all the play	999
	There is not one word apt, one player fitted:	999
	And tragical, my noble lord, it is;	999
	For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.	999
	Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,	999
	Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears	999
	The passion of loud laughter never shed.	999
	999
THESEUS	What are they that do play it?	999
	999
PHILOSTRATE	Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,	999
	Which never labour'd in their minds till now,	999
	And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories	999
	With this same play, against your nuptial.	999
	999
THESEUS	And we will hear it.	999
	999
PHILOSTRATE	No, my noble lord;	999
	It is not for you: I have heard it over,	999
	And it is nothing, nothing in the world;	999
	Unless you can find sport in their intents,	999
	Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,	999
	To do you service.	999
	999
THESEUS	                  I will hear that play;	999
	For never anything can be amiss,	999
	When simpleness and duty tender it.	999
	Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.	999
	999
	[Exit PHILOSTRATE]	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged	999
	And duty in his service perishing.	999
	999
THESEUS	Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	He says they can do nothing in this kind.	999
	999
THESEUS	The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.	999
	Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:	999
	And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect	999
	Takes it in might, not merit.	999
	Where I have come, great clerks have purposed	999
	To greet me with premeditated welcomes;	999
	Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,	999
	Make periods in the midst of sentences,	999
	Throttle their practised accent in their fears	999
	And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,	999
	Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,	999
	Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;	999
	And in the modesty of fearful duty	999
	I read as much as from the rattling tongue	999
	Of saucy and audacious eloquence.	999
	Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity	999
	In least speak most, to my capacity.	999
	999
	[Re-enter PHILOSTRATE]	999
	999
PHILOSTRATE	So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd.	999
	999
THESEUS	Let him approach.	999
	999
	[Flourish of trumpets]	999
	999
	[Enter QUINCE for the Prologue]	999
	999
Prologue	If we offend, it is with our good will.	999
	That you should think, we come not to offend,	999
	But with good will. To show our simple skill,	999
	That is the true beginning of our end.	999
	Consider then we come but in despite.	999
	We do not come as minding to contest you,	999
	Our true intent is. All for your delight	999
	We are not here. That you should here repent you,	999
	The actors are at hand and by their show	999
	You shall know all that you are like to know.	999
	999
THESEUS	This fellow doth not stand upon points.	999
	999
LYSANDER	He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows	999
	not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not	999
	enough to speak, but to speak true.	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child	999
	on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.	999
	999
THESEUS	His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing	999
	impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?	999
	999
	[Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion]	999
	999
Prologue	Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;	999
	But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.	999
	This man is Pyramus, if you would know;	999
	This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.	999
	This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present	999
	Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;	999
	And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content	999
	To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.	999
	This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,	999
	Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,	999
	By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn	999
	To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.	999
	This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,	999
	The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,	999
	Did scare away, or rather did affright;	999
	And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,	999
	Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.	999
	Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,	999
	And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:	999
	Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,	999
	He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;	999
	And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,	999
	His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,	999
	Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain	999
	At large discourse, while here they do remain.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine]	999
	999
THESEUS	I wonder if the lion be to speak.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.	999
	999
Wall	In this same interlude it doth befall	999
	That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;	999
	And such a wall, as I would have you think,	999
	That had in it a crannied hole or chink,	999
	Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,	999
	Did whisper often very secretly.	999
	This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show	999
	That I am that same wall; the truth is so:	999
	And this the cranny is, right and sinister,	999
	Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.	999
	999
THESEUS	Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard	999
	discourse, my lord.	999
	999
	[Enter Pyramus]	999
	999
THESEUS	Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!	999
	999
Pyramus	O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!	999
	O night, which ever art when day is not!	999
	O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,	999
	I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!	999
	And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,	999
	That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!	999
	Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,	999
	Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!	999
	999
	[Wall holds up his fingers]	999
	999
	Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!	999
	But what see I? No Thisby do I see.	999
	O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!	999
	Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!	999
	999
THESEUS	The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.	999
	999
Pyramus	No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'	999
	is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to	999
	spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will	999
	fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.	999
	999
	[Enter Thisbe]	999
	999
Thisbe	O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,	999
	For parting my fair Pyramus and me!	999
	My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,	999
	Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.	999
	999
Pyramus	I see a voice: now will I to the chink,	999
	To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!	999
	999
Thisbe	My love thou art, my love I think.	999
	999
Pyramus	Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;	999
	And, like Limander, am I trusty still.	999
	999
Thisbe	And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.	999
	999
Pyramus	Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.	999
	999
Thisbe	As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.	999
	999
Pyramus	O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!	999
	999
Thisbe	I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.	999
	999
Pyramus	Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?	999
	999
Thisbe	'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe]	999
	999
Wall	Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;	999
	And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
THESEUS	Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear	999
	without warning.	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.	999
	999
THESEUS	The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst	999
	are no worse, if imagination amend them.	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.	999
	999
THESEUS	If we imagine no worse of them than they of	999
	themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here	999
	come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.	999
	999
	[Enter Lion and Moonshine]	999
	999
Lion	You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear	999
	The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,	999
	May now perchance both quake and tremble here,	999
	When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.	999
	Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am	999
	A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;	999
	For, if I should as lion come in strife	999
	Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.	999
	999
THESEUS	A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.	999
	999
LYSANDER	This lion is a very fox for his valour.	999
	999
THESEUS	True; and a goose for his discretion.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his	999
	discretion; and the fox carries the goose.	999
	999
THESEUS	His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;	999
	for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:	999
	leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.	999
	999
Moonshine	This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	He should have worn the horns on his head.	999
	999
THESEUS	He is no crescent, and his horns are	999
	invisible within the circumference.	999
	999
Moonshine	This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;	999
	Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.	999
	999
THESEUS	This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man	999
	should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the	999
	man i' the moon?	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	He dares not come there for the candle; for, you	999
	see, it is already in snuff.	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!	999
	999
THESEUS	It appears, by his small light of discretion, that	999
	he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all	999
	reason, we must stay the time.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Proceed, Moon.	999
	999
Moonshine	All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the	999
	lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this	999
	thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all	999
	these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.	999
	999
	[Enter Thisbe]	999
	999
Thisbe	This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?	999
	999
Lion	[Roaring]  Oh--	999
	999
	[Thisbe runs off]	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Well roared, Lion.	999
	999
THESEUS	Well run, Thisbe.	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a	999
	good grace.	999
	999
	[The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit]	999
	999
THESEUS	Well moused, Lion.	999
	999
LYSANDER	And so the lion vanished.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	And then came Pyramus.	999
	999
	[Enter Pyramus]	999
	999
Pyramus	Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;	999
	I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;	999
	For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,	999
	I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.	999
	But stay, O spite!	999
	But mark, poor knight,	999
	What dreadful dole is here!	999
	Eyes, do you see?	999
	How can it be?	999
	O dainty duck! O dear!	999
	Thy mantle good,	999
	What, stain'd with blood!	999
	Approach, ye Furies fell!	999
	O Fates, come, come,	999
	Cut thread and thrum;	999
	Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!	999
	999
THESEUS	This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would	999
	go near to make a man look sad.	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.	999
	999
Pyramus	O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?	999
	Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:	999
	Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame	999
	That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd	999
	with cheer.	999
	Come, tears, confound;	999
	Out, sword, and wound	999
	The pap of Pyramus;	999
	Ay, that left pap,	999
	Where heart doth hop:	999
	999
	[Stabs himself]	999
	999
	Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.	999
	Now am I dead,	999
	Now am I fled;	999
	My soul is in the sky:	999
	Tongue, lose thy light;	999
	Moon take thy flight:	999
	999
	[Exit Moonshine]	999
	999
	Now die, die, die, die, die.	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.	999
	999
LYSANDER	Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.	999
	999
THESEUS	With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and	999
	prove an ass.	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes	999
	back and finds her lover?	999
	999
THESEUS	She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and	999
	her passion ends the play.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Thisbe]	999
	999
HIPPOLYTA	Methinks she should not use a long one for such a	999
	Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which	999
	Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;	999
	she for a woman, God bless us.	999
	999
LYSANDER	She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	And thus she means, videlicet:--	999
	999
Thisbe	          Asleep, my love?	999
	What, dead, my dove?	999
	O Pyramus, arise!	999
	Speak, speak. Quite dumb?	999
	Dead, dead? A tomb	999
	Must cover thy sweet eyes.	999
	These My lips,	999
	This cherry nose,	999
	These yellow cowslip cheeks,	999
	Are gone, are gone:	999
	Lovers, make moan:	999
	His eyes were green as leeks.	999
	O Sisters Three,	999
	Come, come to me,	999
	With hands as pale as milk;	999
	Lay them in gore,	999
	Since you have shore	999
	With shears his thread of silk.	999
	Tongue, not a word:	999
	Come, trusty sword;	999
	Come, blade, my breast imbrue:	999
	999
	[Stabs herself]	999
	999
	And, farewell, friends;	999
	Thus Thisby ends:	999
	Adieu, adieu, adieu.	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
THESEUS	Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.	999
	999
DEMETRIUS	Ay, and Wall too.	999
	999
BOTTOM	[Starting up]  No assure you; the wall is down that	999
	parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the	999
	epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two	999
	of our company?	999
	999
THESEUS	No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no	999
	excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all	999
	dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he	999
	that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself	999
	in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine	999
	tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably	999
	discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your	999
	epilogue alone.	999
	999
	[A dance]	999
	999
	The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:	999
	Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.	999
	I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn	999
	As much as we this night have overwatch'd.	999
	This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled	999
	The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.	999
	A fortnight hold we this solemnity,	999
	In nightly revels and new jollity.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Enter PUCK]	999
	999
PUCK	     Now the hungry lion roars,	999
	And the wolf behowls the moon;	999
	Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,	999
	All with weary task fordone.	999
	Now the wasted brands do glow,	999
	Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,	999
	Puts the wretch that lies in woe	999
	In remembrance of a shroud.	999
	Now it is the time of night	999
	That the graves all gaping wide,	999
	Every one lets forth his sprite,	999
	In the church-way paths to glide:	999
	And we fairies, that do run	999
	By the triple Hecate's team,	999
	From the presence of the sun,	999
	Following darkness like a dream,	999
	Now are frolic: not a mouse	999
	Shall disturb this hallow'd house:	999
	I am sent with broom before,	999
	To sweep the dust behind the door.	999
	999
	[Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train]	999
	999
OBERON	     Through the house give gathering light,	999
	By the dead and drowsy fire:	999
	Every elf and fairy sprite	999
	Hop as light as bird from brier;	999
	And this ditty, after me,	999
	Sing, and dance it trippingly.	999
	999
TITANIA	First, rehearse your song by rote	999
	To each word a warbling note:	999
	Hand in hand, with fairy grace,	999
	Will we sing, and bless this place.	999
	999
	[Song and dance]	999
	999
OBERON	Now, until the break of day,	999
	Through this house each fairy stray.	999
	To the best bride-bed will we,	999
	Which by us shall blessed be;	999
	And the issue there create	999
	Ever shall be fortunate.	999
	So shall all the couples three	999
	Ever true in loving be;	999
	And the blots of Nature's hand	999
	Shall not in their issue stand;	999
	Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,	999
	Nor mark prodigious, such as are	999
	Despised in nativity,	999
	Shall upon their children be.	999
	With this field-dew consecrate,	999
	Every fairy take his gait;	999
	And each several chamber bless,	999
	Through this palace, with sweet peace;	999
	And the owner of it blest	999
	Ever shall in safety rest.	999
	Trip away; make no stay;	999
	Meet me all by break of day.	999
	999
	[Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train]	999
	999
PUCK	If we shadows have offended,	999
	Think but this, and all is mended,	999
	That you have but slumber'd here	999
	While these visions did appear.	999
	And this weak and idle theme,	999
	No more yielding but a dream,	999
	Gentles, do not reprehend:	999
	if you pardon, we will mend:	999
	And, as I am an honest Puck,	999
	If we have unearned luck	999
	Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,	999
	We will make amends ere long;	999
	Else the Puck a liar call;	999
	So, good night unto you all.	999
	Give me your hands, if we be friends,	999
	And Robin shall restore amends.	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Before LEONATO'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a	999
	Messenger]	999
	999
LEONATO	I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon	999
	comes this night to Messina.	999
	999
Messenger	He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off	999
	when I left him.	999
	999
LEONATO	How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?	999
	999
Messenger	But few of any sort, and none of name.	999
	999
LEONATO	A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings	999
	home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath	999
	bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.	999
	999
Messenger	Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by	999
	Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the	999
	promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,	999
	the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better	999
	bettered expectation than you must expect of me to	999
	tell you how.	999
	999
LEONATO	He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much	999
	glad of it.	999
	999
Messenger	I have already delivered him letters, and there	999
	appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could	999
	not show itself modest enough without a badge of	999
	bitterness.	999
	999
LEONATO	Did he break out into tears?	999
	999
Messenger	In great measure.	999
	999
LEONATO	A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces	999
	truer than those that are so washed. How much	999
	better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!	999
	999
BEATRICE	I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the	999
	wars or no?	999
	999
Messenger	I know none of that name, lady: there was none such	999
	in the army of any sort.	999
	999
LEONATO	What is he that you ask for, niece?	999
	999
HERO	My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.	999
	999
Messenger	O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.	999
	999
BEATRICE	He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged	999
	Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading	999
	the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged	999
	him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he	999
	killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath	999
	he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.	999
	999
LEONATO	Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;	999
	but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.	999
	999
Messenger	He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.	999
	999
BEATRICE	You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:	999
	he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an	999
	excellent stomach.	999
	999
Messenger	And a good soldier too, lady.	999
	999
BEATRICE	And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?	999
	999
Messenger	A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all	999
	honourable virtues.	999
	999
BEATRICE	It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:	999
	but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.	999
	999
LEONATO	You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a	999
	kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:	999
	they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit	999
	between them.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last	999
	conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and	999
	now is the whole man governed with one: so that if	999
	he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him	999
	bear it for a difference between himself and his	999
	horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,	999
	to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his	999
	companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.	999
	999
Messenger	Is't possible?	999
	999
BEATRICE	Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as	999
	the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the	999
	next block.	999
	999
Messenger	I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.	999
	999
BEATRICE	No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray	999
	you, who is his companion? Is there no young	999
	squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?	999
	999
Messenger	He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.	999
	999
BEATRICE	O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he	999
	is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker	999
	runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if	999
	he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a	999
	thousand pound ere a' be cured.	999
	999
Messenger	I will hold friends with you, lady.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Do, good friend.	999
	999
LEONATO	You will never run mad, niece.	999
	999
BEATRICE	No, not till a hot January.	999
	999
Messenger	Don Pedro is approached.	999
	999
	[Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK,	999
	and BALTHASAR]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your	999
	trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid	999
	cost, and you encounter it.	999
	999
LEONATO	Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of	999
	your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should	999
	remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides	999
	and happiness takes his leave.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this	999
	is your daughter.	999
	999
LEONATO	Her mother hath many times told me so.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?	999
	999
LEONATO	Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this	999
	what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers	999
	herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an	999
	honourable father.	999
	999
BENEDICK	If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not	999
	have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as	999
	like him as she is.	999
	999
BEATRICE	I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior	999
	Benedick: nobody marks you.	999
	999
BENEDICK	What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?	999
	999
BEATRICE	Is it possible disdain should die while she hath	999
	such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?	999
	Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come	999
	in her presence.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I	999
	am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I	999
	would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard	999
	heart; for, truly, I love none.	999
	999
BEATRICE	A dear happiness to women: they would else have	999
	been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God	999
	and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I	999
	had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man	999
	swear he loves me.	999
	999
BENEDICK	God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some	999
	gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate	999
	scratched face.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such	999
	a face as yours were.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.	999
	999
BEATRICE	A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.	999
	999
BENEDICK	I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and	999
	so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's	999
	name; I have done.	999
	999
BEATRICE	You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio	999
	and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath	999
	invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at	999
	the least a month; and he heartily prays some	999
	occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no	999
	hypocrite, but prays from his heart.	999
	999
LEONATO	If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.	999
	999
	[To DON JOHN]	999
	999
	Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to	999
	the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.	999
	999
DON JOHN	I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank	999
	you.	999
	999
LEONATO	Please it your grace lead on?	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO]	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?	999
	999
BENEDICK	I noted her not; but I looked on her.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Is she not a modest young lady?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for	999
	my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak	999
	after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high	999
	praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little	999
	for a great praise: only this commendation I can	999
	afford her, that were she other than she is, she	999
	were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I	999
	do not like her.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me	999
	truly how thou likest her.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Can the world buy such a jewel?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this	999
	with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,	999
	to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a	999
	rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take	999
	you, to go in the song?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I	999
	looked on.	999
	999
BENEDICK	I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such	999
	matter: there's her cousin, an she were not	999
	possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty	999
	as the first of May doth the last of December. But I	999
	hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the	999
	contrary, if Hero would be my wife.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world	999
	one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?	999
	Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?	999
	Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck	999
	into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away	999
	Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.	999
	999
	[Re-enter DON PEDRO]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	What secret hath held you here, that you followed	999
	not to Leonato's?	999
	999
BENEDICK	I would your grace would constrain me to tell.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	I charge thee on thy allegiance.	999
	999
BENEDICK	You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb	999
	man; I would have you think so; but, on my	999
	allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is	999
	in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.	999
	Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's	999
	short daughter.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	If this were so, so were it uttered.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor	999
	'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be	999
	so.'	999
	999
CLAUDIO	If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it	999
	should be otherwise.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	By my troth, I speak my thought.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.	999
	999
BENEDICK	And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	That I love her, I feel.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	That she is worthy, I know.	999
	999
BENEDICK	That I neither feel how she should be loved nor	999
	know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that	999
	fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite	999
	of beauty.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	And never could maintain his part but in the force	999
	of his will.	999
	999
BENEDICK	That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she	999
	brought me up, I likewise give her most humble	999
	thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my	999
	forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,	999
	all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do	999
	them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the	999
	right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which	999
	I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.	999
	999
BENEDICK	With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,	999
	not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood	999
	with love than I will get again with drinking, pick	999
	out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me	999
	up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of	999
	blind Cupid.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou	999
	wilt prove a notable argument.	999
	999
BENEDICK	If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot	999
	at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on	999
	the shoulder, and called Adam.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull	999
	doth bear the yoke.'	999
	999
BENEDICK	The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible	999
	Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set	999
	them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,	999
	and in such great letters as they write 'Here is	999
	good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign	999
	'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'	999
	999
CLAUDIO	If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in	999
	Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.	999
	999
BENEDICK	I look for an earthquake too, then.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Well, you temporize with the hours. In the	999
	meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to	999
	Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will	999
	not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made	999
	great preparation.	999
	999
BENEDICK	I have almost matter enough in me for such an	999
	embassage; and so I commit you--	999
	999
CLAUDIO	To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--	999
	999
DON PEDRO	The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your	999
	discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and	999
	the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere	999
	you flout old ends any further, examine your	999
	conscience: and so I leave you.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CLAUDIO	My liege, your highness now may do me good.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,	999
	And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn	999
	Any hard lesson that may do thee good.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Hath Leonato any son, my lord?	999
	999
DON PEDRO	No child but Hero; she's his only heir.	999
	Dost thou affect her, Claudio?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	O, my lord,	999
	When you went onward on this ended action,	999
	I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,	999
	That liked, but had a rougher task in hand	999
	Than to drive liking to the name of love:	999
	But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts	999
	Have left their places vacant, in their rooms	999
	Come thronging soft and delicate desires,	999
	All prompting me how fair young Hero is,	999
	Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Thou wilt be like a lover presently	999
	And tire the hearer with a book of words.	999
	If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,	999
	And I will break with her and with her father,	999
	And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end	999
	That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	How sweetly you do minister to love,	999
	That know love's grief by his complexion!	999
	But lest my liking might too sudden seem,	999
	I would have salved it with a longer treatise.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	What need the bridge much broader than the flood?	999
	The fairest grant is the necessity.	999
	Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,	999
	And I will fit thee with the remedy.	999
	I know we shall have revelling to-night:	999
	I will assume thy part in some disguise	999
	And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,	999
	And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart	999
	And take her hearing prisoner with the force	999
	And strong encounter of my amorous tale:	999
	Then after to her father will I break;	999
	And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.	999
	In practise let us put it presently.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting]	999
	999
LEONATO	How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?	999
	hath he provided this music?	999
	999
ANTONIO	He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell	999
	you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.	999
	999
LEONATO	Are they good?	999
	999
ANTONIO	As the event stamps them: but they have a good	999
	cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count	999
	Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine	999
	orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:	999
	the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my	999
	niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it	999
	this night in a dance: and if he found her	999
	accordant, he meant to take the present time by the	999
	top and instantly break with you of it.	999
	999
LEONATO	Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?	999
	999
ANTONIO	A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and	999
	question him yourself.	999
	999
LEONATO	No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear	999
	itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,	999
	that she may be the better prepared for an answer,	999
	if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.	999
	999
	[Enter Attendants]	999
	999
	Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you	999
	mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your	999
	skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.	999

SCENE III	The same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE]	999
	999
CONRADE	What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out	999
	of measure sad?	999
	999
DON JOHN	There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;	999
	therefore the sadness is without limit.	999
	999
CONRADE	You should hear reason.	999
	999
DON JOHN	And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?	999
	999
CONRADE	If not a present remedy, at least a patient	999
	sufferance.	999
	999
DON JOHN	I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,	999
	born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral	999
	medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide	999
	what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile	999
	at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait	999
	for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and	999
	tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and	999
	claw no man in his humour.	999
	999
CONRADE	Yea, but you must not make the full show of this	999
	till you may do it without controlment. You have of	999
	late stood out against your brother, and he hath	999
	ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is	999
	impossible you should take true root but by the	999
	fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful	999
	that you frame the season for your own harvest.	999
	999
DON JOHN	I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in	999
	his grace, and it better fits my blood to be	999
	disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob	999
	love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to	999
	be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied	999
	but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with	999
	a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I	999
	have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my	999
	mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do	999
	my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and	999
	seek not to alter me.	999
	999
CONRADE	Can you make no use of your discontent?	999
	999
DON JOHN	I make all use of it, for I use it only.	999
	Who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter BORACHIO]	999
	999
	What news, Borachio?	999
	999
BORACHIO	I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your	999
	brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I	999
	can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.	999
	999
DON JOHN	Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?	999
	What is he for a fool that betroths himself to	999
	unquietness?	999
	999
BORACHIO	Marry, it is your brother's right hand.	999
	999
DON JOHN	Who? the most exquisite Claudio?	999
	999
BORACHIO	Even he.	999
	999
DON JOHN	A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks	999
	he?	999
	999
BORACHIO	Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.	999
	999
DON JOHN	A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?	999
	999
BORACHIO	Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a	999
	musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand	999
	in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the	999
	arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the	999
	prince should woo Hero for himself, and having	999
	obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.	999
	999
DON JOHN	Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to	999
	my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the	999
	glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I	999
	bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?	999
	999
CONRADE	To the death, my lord.	999
	999
DON JOHN	Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the	999
	greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of	999
	my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?	999
	999
BORACHIO	We'll wait upon your lordship.	999

	999
SCENE I	A hall in LEONATO'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others]	999
	999
	999
LEONATO	Was not Count John here at supper?	999
	999
ANTONIO	I saw him not.	999
	999
BEATRICE	How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see	999
	him but I am heart-burned an hour after.	999
	999
HERO	He is of a very melancholy disposition.	999
	999
BEATRICE	He were an excellent man that were made just in the	999
	midway between him and Benedick: the one is too	999
	like an image and says nothing, and the other too	999
	like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.	999
	999
LEONATO	Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's	999
	mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior	999
	Benedick's face,--	999
	999
BEATRICE	With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money	999
	enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman	999
	in the world, if a' could get her good-will.	999
	999
LEONATO	By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a	999
	husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.	999
	999
ANTONIO	In faith, she's too curst.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's	999
	sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst	999
	cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.	999
	999
LEONATO	So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Just, if he send me no husband; for the which	999
	blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and	999
	evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a	999
	beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.	999
	999
LEONATO	You may light on a husband that hath no beard.	999
	999
BEATRICE	What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel	999
	and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a	999
	beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no	999
	beard is less than a man: and he that is more than	999
	a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a	999
	man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take	999
	sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his	999
	apes into hell.	999
	999
LEONATO	Well, then, go you into hell?	999
	999
BEATRICE	No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet	999
	me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and	999
	say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to	999
	heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver	999
	I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the	999
	heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and	999
	there live we as merry as the day is long.	999
	999
ANTONIO	[To HERO]  Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled	999
	by your father.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy	999
	and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all	999
	that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else	999
	make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please	999
	me.'	999
	999
LEONATO	Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Not till God make men of some other metal than	999
	earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be	999
	overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make	999
	an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?	999
	No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;	999
	and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.	999
	999
LEONATO	Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince	999
	do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.	999
	999
BEATRICE	The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be	999
	not wooed in good time: if the prince be too	999
	important, tell him there is measure in every thing	999
	and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:	999
	wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,	999
	a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot	999
	and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as	999
	fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a	999
	measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes	999
	repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the	999
	cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.	999
	999
LEONATO	Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.	999
	999
BEATRICE	I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.	999
	999
LEONATO	The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.	999
	999
	[All put on their masks]	999

	999
DON PEDRO	Lady, will you walk about with your friend?	999
	999
HERO	So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,	999
	I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	With me in your company?	999
	999
HERO	I may say so, when I please.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	And when please you to say so?	999
	999
HERO	When I like your favour; for God defend the lute	999
	should be like the case!	999
	999
DON PEDRO	My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.	999
	999
HERO	Why, then, your visor should be thatched.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Speak low, if you speak love.	999
	999
	[Drawing her aside]	999
	999
BALTHASAR	Well, I would you did like me.	999
	999
MARGARET	So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many	999
	ill-qualities.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	Which is one?	999
	999
MARGARET	I say my prayers aloud.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.	999
	999
MARGARET	God match me with a good dancer!	999
	999
BALTHASAR	Amen.	999
	999
MARGARET	And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is	999
	done! Answer, clerk.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	No more words: the clerk is answered.	999
	999
URSULA	I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.	999
	999
ANTONIO	At a word, I am not.	999
	999
URSULA	I know you by the waggling of your head.	999
	999
ANTONIO	To tell you true, I counterfeit him.	999
	999
URSULA	You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were	999
	the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you	999
	are he, you are he.	999
	999
ANTONIO	At a word, I am not.	999
	999
URSULA	Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your	999
	excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,	999
	mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an	999
	end.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Will you not tell me who told you so?	999
	999
BENEDICK	No, you shall pardon me.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Nor will you not tell me who you are?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Not now.	999
	999
BEATRICE	That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit	999
	out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was	999
	Signior Benedick that said so.	999
	999
BENEDICK	What's he?	999
	999
BEATRICE	I am sure you know him well enough.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Not I, believe me.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Did he never make you laugh?	999
	999
BENEDICK	I pray you, what is he?	999
	999
BEATRICE	Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;	999
	only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:	999
	none but libertines delight in him; and the	999
	commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;	999
	for he both pleases men and angers them, and then	999
	they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in	999
	the fleet: I would he had boarded me.	999
	999
BENEDICK	When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;	999
	which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,	999
	strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a	999
	partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no	999
	supper that night.	999
	999
	[Music]	999
	999
	We must follow the leaders.	999
	999
BENEDICK	In every good thing.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at	999
	the next turning.	999
	999
	[Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO,	999
	and CLAUDIO]	999
	999
DON JOHN	Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath	999
	withdrawn her father to break with him about it.	999
	The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.	999
	999
BORACHIO	And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.	999
	999
DON JOHN	Are not you Signior Benedick?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	You know me well; I am he.	999
	999
DON JOHN	Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:	999
	he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him	999
	from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may	999
	do the part of an honest man in it.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	How know you he loves her?	999
	999
DON JOHN	I heard him swear his affection.	999
	999
BORACHIO	So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.	999
	999
DON JOHN	Come, let us to the banquet.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO]	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,	999
	But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.	999
	'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.	999
	Friendship is constant in all other things	999
	Save in the office and affairs of love:	999
	Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;	999
	Let every eye negotiate for itself	999
	And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch	999
	Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.	999
	This is an accident of hourly proof,	999
	Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!	999
	999
	[Re-enter BENEDICK]	999
	999
BENEDICK	Count Claudio?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Yea, the same.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Come, will you go with me?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Whither?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Even to the next willow, about your own business,	999
	county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?	999
	about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under	999
	your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear	999
	it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I wish him joy of her.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they	999
	sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would	999
	have served you thus?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I pray you, leave me.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the	999
	boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	If it will not be, I'll leave you.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BENEDICK	Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.	999
	But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not	999
	know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go	999
	under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I	999
	am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it	999
	is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice	999
	that puts the world into her person and so gives me	999
	out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.	999
	999
	[Re-enter DON PEDRO]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.	999
	I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a	999
	warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,	999
	that your grace had got the good will of this young	999
	lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,	999
	either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or	999
	to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	To be whipped! What's his fault?	999
	999
BENEDICK	The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being	999
	overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his	999
	companion, and he steals it.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The	999
	transgression is in the stealer.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,	999
	and the garland too; for the garland he might have	999
	worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on	999
	you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to	999
	the owner.	999
	999
BENEDICK	If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,	999
	you say honestly.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the	999
	gentleman that danced with her told her she is much	999
	wronged by you.	999
	999
BENEDICK	O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!	999
	an oak but with one green leaf on it would have	999
	answered her; my very visor began to assume life and	999
	scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been	999
	myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was	999
	duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest	999
	with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood	999
	like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at	999
	me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:	999
	if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,	999
	there were no living near her; she would infect to	999
	the north star. I would not marry her, though she	999
	were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before	999
	he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have	999
	turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make	999
	the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find	999
	her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God	999
	some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while	999
	she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a	999
	sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they	999
	would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror	999
	and perturbation follows her.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Look, here she comes.	999
	999
	[Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATO]	999
	999
BENEDICK	Will your grace command me any service to the	999
	world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now	999
	to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;	999
	I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the	999
	furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of	999
	Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great	999
	Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,	999
	rather than hold three words' conference with this	999
	harpy. You have no employment for me?	999
	999
DON PEDRO	None, but to desire your good company.	999
	999
BENEDICK	O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot	999
	endure my Lady Tongue.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of	999
	Signior Benedick.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave	999
	him use for it, a double heart for his single one:	999
	marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,	999
	therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.	999
	999
BEATRICE	So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I	999
	should prove the mother of fools. I have brought	999
	Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Not sad, my lord.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	How then? sick?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Neither, my lord.	999
	999
BEATRICE	The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor	999
	well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and	999
	something of that jealous complexion.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;	999
	though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is	999
	false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and	999
	fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,	999
	and his good will obtained: name the day of	999
	marriage, and God give thee joy!	999
	999
LEONATO	Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my	999
	fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an	999
	grace say Amen to it.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Speak, count, 'tis your cue.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were	999
	but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as	999
	you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for	999
	you and dote upon the exchange.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth	999
	with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on	999
	the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his	999
	ear that he is in her heart.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	And so she doth, cousin.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the	999
	world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a	999
	corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.	999
	999
BEATRICE	I would rather have one of your father's getting.	999
	Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your	999
	father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Will you have me, lady?	999
	999
BEATRICE	No, my lord, unless I might have another for	999
	working-days: your grace is too costly to wear	999
	every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I	999
	was born to speak all mirth and no matter.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best	999
	becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in	999
	a merry hour.	999
	999
BEATRICE	No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there	999
	was a star danced, and under that was I born.	999
	Cousins, God give you joy!	999
	999
LEONATO	Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?	999
	999
BEATRICE	I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.	999
	999
LEONATO	There's little of the melancholy element in her, my	999
	lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and	999
	not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,	999
	she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked	999
	herself with laughing.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.	999
	999
LEONATO	O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	She were an excellent wife for Benedict.	999
	999
LEONATO	O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,	999
	they would talk themselves mad.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love	999
	have all his rites.	999
	999
LEONATO	Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just	999
	seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all	999
	things answer my mind.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:	999
	but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go	999
	dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of	999
	Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior	999
	Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of	999
	affection the one with the other. I would fain have	999
	it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if	999
	you three will but minister such assistance as I	999
	shall give you direction.	999
	999
LEONATO	My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten	999
	nights' watchings.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	And I, my lord.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	And you too, gentle Hero?	999
	999
HERO	I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my	999
	cousin to a good husband.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that	999
	I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble	999
	strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I	999
	will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she	999
	shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your	999
	two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in	999
	despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he	999
	shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,	999
	Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be	999
	ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,	999
	and I will tell you my drift.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO]	999
	999
DON JOHN	It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the	999
	daughter of Leonato.	999
	999
BORACHIO	Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.	999
	999
DON JOHN	Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be	999
	medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,	999
	and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges	999
	evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?	999
	999
BORACHIO	Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no	999
	dishonesty shall appear in me.	999
	999
DON JOHN	Show me briefly how.	999
	999
BORACHIO	I think I told your lordship a year since, how much	999
	I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting	999
	gentlewoman to Hero.	999
	999
DON JOHN	I remember.	999
	999
BORACHIO	I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,	999
	appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.	999
	999
DON JOHN	What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?	999
	999
BORACHIO	The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to	999
	the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that	999
	he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned	999
	Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold	999
	up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.	999
	999
DON JOHN	What proof shall I make of that?	999
	999
BORACHIO	Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,	999
	to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any	999
	other issue?	999
	999
DON JOHN	Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.	999
	999
BORACHIO	Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and	999
	the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know	999
	that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the	999
	prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's	999
	honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's	999
	reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the	999
	semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered	999
	thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:	999
	offer them instances; which shall bear no less	999
	likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,	999
	hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me	999
	Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night	999
	before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I	999
	will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be	999
	absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth	999
	of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called	999
	assurance and all the preparation overthrown.	999
	999
DON JOHN	Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put	999
	it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and	999
	thy fee is a thousand ducats.	999
	999
BORACHIO	Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning	999
	shall not shame me.	999
	999
DON JOHN	I will presently go learn their day of marriage.	999

SCENE III	LEONATO'S orchard.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter BENEDICK]	999
	999
BENEDICK	Boy!	999
	999
	[Enter Boy]	999
	999
Boy	Signior?	999
	999
BENEDICK	In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither	999
	to me in the orchard.	999
	999
Boy	I am here already, sir.	999
	999
BENEDICK	I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.	999
	999
	[Exit Boy]	999
	999
	I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much	999
	another man is a fool when he dedicates his	999
	behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at	999
	such shallow follies in others, become the argument	999
	of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man	999
	is Claudio. I have known when there was no music	999
	with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he	999
	rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known	999
	when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a	999
	good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,	999
	carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to	999
	speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man	999
	and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his	999
	words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many	999
	strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with	999
	these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not	999
	be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but	999
	I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster	999
	of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman	999
	is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am	999
	well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all	999
	graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in	999
	my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,	999
	or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;	999
	fair, or I'll   never look on her; mild, or come not	999
	near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good	999
	discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall	999
	be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and	999
	Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.	999
	999
	[Withdraws]	999
	999
	[Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Come, shall we hear this music?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,	999
	As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!	999
	999
DON PEDRO	See you where Benedick hath hid himself?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	O, very well, my lord: the music ended,	999
	We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.	999
	999
	[Enter BALTHASAR with Music]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice	999
	To slander music any more than once.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	It is the witness still of excellency	999
	To put a strange face on his own perfection.	999
	I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;	999
	Since many a wooer doth commence his suit	999
	To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,	999
	Yet will he swear he loves.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Now, pray thee, come;	999
	Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,	999
	Do it in notes.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	                  Note this before my notes;	999
	There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;	999
	Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.	999
	[Air]	999
	999
BENEDICK	Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it	999
	not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out	999
	of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when	999
	all's done.	999
	999
	[The Song]	999
	999
BALTHASAR	     Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,	999
	Men were deceivers ever,	999
	One foot in sea and one on shore,	999
	To one thing constant never:	999
	Then sigh not so, but let them go,	999
	And be you blithe and bonny,	999
	Converting all your sounds of woe	999
	Into Hey nonny, nonny.	999
	999
	Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,	999
	Of dumps so dull and heavy;	999
	The fraud of men was ever so,	999
	Since summer first was leafy:	999
	Then sigh not so, &c.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	By my troth, a good song.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	And an ill singer, my lord.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.	999
	999
BENEDICK	An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,	999
	they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad	999
	voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the	999
	night-raven, come what plague could have come after	999
	it.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,	999
	get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we	999
	would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.	999
	999
BALTHASAR	The best I can, my lord.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Do so: farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit BALTHASAR]	999
	999
	Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of	999
	to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with	999
	Signior Benedick?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did	999
	never think that lady would have loved any man.	999
	999
LEONATO	No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she	999
	should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in	999
	all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?	999
	999
LEONATO	By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think	999
	of it but that she loves him with an enraged	999
	affection: it is past the infinite of thought.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	May be she doth but counterfeit.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Faith, like enough.	999
	999
LEONATO	O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of	999
	passion came so near the life of passion as she	999
	discovers it.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Why, what effects of passion shows she?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.	999
	999
LEONATO	What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard	999
	my daughter tell you how.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	She did, indeed.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I	999
	thought her spirit had been invincible against all	999
	assaults of affection.	999
	999
LEONATO	I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially	999
	against Benedick.	999
	999
BENEDICK	I should think this a gull, but that the	999
	white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,	999
	sure, hide himself in such reverence.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?	999
	999
LEONATO	No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall	999
	I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him	999
	with scorn, write to him that I love him?'	999
	999
LEONATO	This says she now when she is beginning to write to	999
	him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and	999
	there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a	999
	sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a	999
	pretty jest your daughter told us of.	999
	999
LEONATO	O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she	999
	found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	That.	999
	999
LEONATO	O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;	999
	railed at herself, that she should be so immodest	999
	to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I	999
	measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I	999
	should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I	999
	love him, I should.'	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,	999
	beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O	999
	sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'	999
	999
LEONATO	She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the	999
	ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter	999
	is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage	999
	to herself: it is very true.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	It were good that Benedick knew of it by some	999
	other, if she will not discover it.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	To what end? He would make but a sport of it and	999
	torment the poor lady worse.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an	999
	excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,	999
	she is virtuous.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	And she is exceeding wise.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	In every thing but in loving Benedick.	999
	999
LEONATO	O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender	999
	a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath	999
	the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just	999
	cause, being her uncle and her guardian.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would	999
	have daffed all other respects and made her half	999
	myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear	999
	what a' will say.	999
	999
LEONATO	Were it good, think you?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she	999
	will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere	999
	she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo	999
	her, rather than she will bate one breath of her	999
	accustomed crossness.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	She doth well: if she should make tender of her	999
	love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the	999
	man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	He is a very proper man.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	He hath indeed a good outward happiness.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	And I take him to be valiant.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of	999
	quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he	999
	avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes	999
	them with a most Christian-like fear.	999
	999
LEONATO	If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:	999
	if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a	999
	quarrel with fear and trembling.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,	999
	howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests	999
	he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall	999
	we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with	999
	good counsel.	999
	999
LEONATO	Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:	999
	let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I	999
	could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see	999
	how much he is unworthy so good a lady.	999
	999
LEONATO	My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never	999
	trust my expectation.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Let there be the same net spread for her; and that	999
	must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The	999
	sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of	999
	another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the	999
	scene that I would see, which will be merely a	999
	dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO]	999
	999
BENEDICK	[Coming forward]  This can be no trick: the	999
	conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of	999
	this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it	999
	seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!	999
	why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:	999
	they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive	999
	the love come from her; they say too that she will	999
	rather die than give any sign of affection. I did	999
	never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy	999
	are they that hear their detractions and can put	999
	them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a	999
	truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis	999
	so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving	999
	me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor	999
	no great argument of her folly, for I will be	999
	horribly in love with her. I may chance have some	999
	odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,	999
	because I have railed so long against marriage: but	999
	doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat	999
	in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.	999
	Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of	999
	the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?	999
	No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would	999
	die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I	999
	were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!	999
	she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in	999
	her.	999
	999
	[Enter BEATRICE]	999
	999
BEATRICE	Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.	999
	999
BEATRICE	I took no more pains for those thanks than you take	999
	pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would	999
	not have come.	999
	999
BENEDICK	You take pleasure then in the message?	999
	999
BEATRICE	Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's	999
	point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,	999
	signior: fare you well.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BENEDICK	Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in	999
	to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took	999
	no more pains for those thanks than you took pains	999
	to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains	999
	that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do	999
	not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not	999
	love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.	999

	999
SCENE I	LEONATO'S garden.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA]	999
	999
HERO	Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;	999
	There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice	999
	Proposing with the prince and Claudio:	999
	Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula	999
	Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse	999
	Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;	999
	And bid her steal into the pleached bower,	999
	Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,	999
	Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,	999
	Made proud by princes, that advance their pride	999
	Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,	999
	To listen our purpose.  This is thy office;	999
	Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.	999
	999
MARGARET	I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HERO	Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,	999
	As we do trace this alley up and down,	999
	Our talk must only be of Benedick.	999
	When I do name him, let it be thy part	999
	To praise him more than ever man did merit:	999
	My talk to thee must be how Benedick	999
	Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter	999
	Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,	999
	That only wounds by hearsay.	999
	999
	[Enter BEATRICE, behind]	999
	999
		       Now begin;	999
	For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs	999
	Close by the ground, to hear our conference.	999
	999
URSULA	The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish	999
	Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,	999
	And greedily devour the treacherous bait:	999
	So angle we for Beatrice; who even now	999
	Is couched in the woodbine coverture.	999
	Fear you not my part of the dialogue.	999
	999
HERO	Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing	999
	Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.	999
	999
	[Approaching the bower]	999
	999
	No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;	999
	I know her spirits are as coy and wild	999
	As haggerds of the rock.	999
	999
URSULA	But are you sure	999
	That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?	999
	999
HERO	So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.	999
	999
URSULA	And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?	999
	999
HERO	They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;	999
	But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,	999
	To wish him wrestle with affection,	999
	And never to let Beatrice know of it.	999
	999
URSULA	Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman	999
	Deserve as full as fortunate a bed	999
	As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?	999
	999
HERO	O god of love! I know he doth deserve	999
	As much as may be yielded to a man:	999
	But Nature never framed a woman's heart	999
	Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;	999
	Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,	999
	Misprising what they look on, and her wit	999
	Values itself so highly that to her	999
	All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,	999
	Nor take no shape nor project of affection,	999
	She is so self-endeared.	999
	999
URSULA	Sure, I think so;	999
	And therefore certainly it were not good	999
	She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.	999
	999
HERO	Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,	999
	How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,	999
	But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,	999
	She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;	999
	If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,	999
	Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;	999
	If low, an agate very vilely cut;	999
	If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;	999
	If silent, why, a block moved with none.	999
	So turns she every man the wrong side out	999
	And never gives to truth and virtue that	999
	Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.	999
	999
URSULA	Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.	999
	999
HERO	No, not to be so odd and from all fashions	999
	As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:	999
	But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,	999
	She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me	999
	Out of myself, press me to death with wit.	999
	Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,	999
	Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:	999
	It were a better death than die with mocks,	999
	Which is as bad as die with tickling.	999
	999
URSULA	Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.	999
	999
HERO	No; rather I will go to Benedick	999
	And counsel him to fight against his passion.	999
	And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders	999
	To stain my cousin with: one doth not know	999
	How much an ill word may empoison liking.	999
	999
URSULA	O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.	999
	She cannot be so much without true judgment--	999
	Having so swift and excellent a wit	999
	As she is prized to have--as to refuse	999
	So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.	999
	999
HERO	He is the only man of Italy.	999
	Always excepted my dear Claudio.	999
	999
URSULA	I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,	999
	Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,	999
	For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,	999
	Goes foremost in report through Italy.	999
	999
HERO	Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.	999
	999
URSULA	His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.	999
	When are you married, madam?	999
	999
HERO	Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:	999
	I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel	999
	Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.	999
	999
URSULA	She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.	999
	999
HERO	If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:	999
	Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.	999
	999
	[Exeunt HERO and URSULA]	999
	999
BEATRICE	[Coming forward]	999
	What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?	999
	Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?	999
	Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!	999
	No glory lives behind the back of such.	999
	And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,	999
	Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:	999
	If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee	999
	To bind our loves up in a holy band;	999
	For others say thou dost deserve, and I	999
	Believe it better than reportingly.	999

SCENE II	A room in LEONATO'S house	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATO]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and	999
	then go I toward Arragon.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll	999
	vouchsafe me.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss	999
	of your marriage as to show a child his new coat	999
	and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold	999
	with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown	999
	of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all	999
	mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's	999
	bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at	999
	him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his	999
	tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his	999
	tongue speaks.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Gallants, I am not as I have been.	999
	999
LEONATO	So say I	methinks you are sadder.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I hope he be in love.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in	999
	him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,	999
	he wants money.	999
	999
BENEDICK	I have the toothache.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Draw it.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Hang it!	999
	999
CLAUDIO	You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	What! sigh for the toothache?	999
	999
LEONATO	Where is but a humour or a worm.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Well, every one can master a grief but he that has	999
	it.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Yet say I, he is in love.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be	999
	a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be	999
	a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the	999
	shape of two countries at once, as, a German from	999
	the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from	999
	the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy	999
	to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no	999
	fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	If he be not in love with some woman, there is no	999
	believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'	999
	mornings; what should that bode?	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Hath any man seen him at the barber's?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,	999
	and the old ornament of his cheek hath already	999
	stuffed tennis-balls.	999
	999
LEONATO	Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him	999
	out by that?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	The greatest note of it is his melancholy.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	And when was he wont to wash his face?	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear	999
	what they say of him.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into	999
	a lute-string and now governed by stops.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,	999
	conclude he is in love.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Nay, but I know who loves him.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of	999
	all, dies for him.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	She shall be buried with her face upwards.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old	999
	signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight	999
	or nine wise words to speak to you, which these	999
	hobby-horses must not hear.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this	999
	played their parts with Beatrice; and then the two	999
	bears will not bite one another when they meet.	999
	999
	[Enter DON JOHN]	999
	999
DON JOHN	My lord and brother, God save you!	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Good den, brother.	999
	999
DON JOHN	If your leisure served, I would speak with you.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	In private?	999
	999
DON JOHN	If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for	999
	what I would speak of concerns him.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	What's the matter?	999
	999
DON JOHN	[To CLAUDIO]  Means your lordship to be married	999
	to-morrow?	999
	999
DON PEDRO	You know he does.	999
	999
DON JOHN	I know not that, when he knows what I know.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.	999
	999
DON JOHN	You may think I love you not: let that appear	999
	hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will	999
	manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you	999
	well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect	999
	your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and	999
	labour ill bestowed.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Why, what's the matter?	999
	999
DON JOHN	I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances	999
	shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,	999
	the lady is disloyal.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Who, Hero?	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Disloyal?	999
	999
DON JOHN	The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I	999
	could say she were worse: think you of a worse	999
	title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till	999
	further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall	999
	see her chamber-window entered, even the night	999
	before her wedding-day: if you love her then,	999
	to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour	999
	to change your mind.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	May this be so?	999
	999
DON PEDRO	I will not think it.	999
	999
DON JOHN	If you dare not trust that you see, confess not	999
	that you know: if you will follow me, I will show	999
	you enough; and when you have seen more and heard	999
	more, proceed accordingly.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry	999
	her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should	999
	wed, there will I shame her.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join	999
	with thee to disgrace her.	999
	999
DON JOHN	I will disparage her no farther till you are my	999
	witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and	999
	let the issue show itself.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	O day untowardly turned!	999
	999
CLAUDIO	O mischief strangely thwarting!	999
	999
DON JOHN	O plague right well prevented! so will you say when	999
	you have seen the sequel.	999

ACT III	999

	999
	999
SCENE III	A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch]	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Are you good men and true?	999
	999
VERGES	Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer	999
	salvation, body and soul.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if	999
	they should have any allegiance in them, being	999
	chosen for the prince's watch.	999
	999
VERGES	Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	First, who think you the most desertless man to be	999
	constable?	999
	999
First Watchman	Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can	999
	write and read.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed	999
	you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is	999
	the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.	999
	999
Second Watchman	Both which, master constable,--	999
	999
DOGBERRY	You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,	999
	for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make	999
	no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,	999
	let that appear when there is no need of such	999
	vanity. You are thought here to be the most	999
	senseless and fit man for the constable of the	999
	watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your	999
	charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are	999
	to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.	999
	999
Second Watchman	How if a' will not stand?	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and	999
	presently call the rest of the watch together and	999
	thank God you are rid of a knave.	999
	999
VERGES	If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none	999
	of the prince's subjects.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	True, and they are to meddle with none but the	999
	prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in	999
	the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to	999
	talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.	999
	999
Watchman	We will rather sleep than talk: we know what	999
	belongs to a watch.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet	999
	watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should	999
	offend: only, have a care that your bills be not	999
	stolen. Well, you are to call at all the	999
	ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.	999
	999
Watchman	How if they will not?	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if	999
	they make you not then the better answer, you may	999
	say they are not the men you took them for.	999
	999
Watchman	Well, sir.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue	999
	of your office, to be no true man; and, for such	999
	kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,	999
	why the more is for your honesty.	999
	999
Watchman	If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay	999
	hands on him?	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they	999
	that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable	999
	way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him	999
	show himself what he is and steal out of your company.	999
	999
VERGES	You have been always called a merciful man, partner.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more	999
	a man who hath any honesty in him.	999
	999
VERGES	If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call	999
	to the nurse and bid her still it.	999
	999
Watchman	How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake	999
	her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her	999
	lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.	999
	999
VERGES	'Tis very true.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are	999
	to present the prince's own person: if you meet the	999
	prince in the night, you may stay him.	999
	999
VERGES	Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows	999
	the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without	999
	the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought	999
	to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a	999
	man against his will.	999
	999
VERGES	By'r lady, I think it be so.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be	999
	any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your	999
	fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.	999
	Come, neighbour.	999
	999
Watchman	Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here	999
	upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch	999
	about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being	999
	there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.	999
	Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES]	999
	999
	[Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE]	999
	999
BORACHIO	What Conrade!	999
	999
Watchman	[Aside]  Peace! stir not.	999
	999
BORACHIO	Conrade, I say!	999
	999
CONRADE	Here, man; I am at thy elbow.	999
	999
BORACHIO	Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a	999
	scab follow.	999
	999
CONRADE	I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward	999
	with thy tale.	999
	999
BORACHIO	Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for	999
	it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,	999
	utter all to thee.	999
	999
Watchman	[Aside]  Some treason, masters: yet stand close.	999
	999
BORACHIO	Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.	999
	999
CONRADE	Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?	999
	999
BORACHIO	Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any	999
	villany should be so rich; for when rich villains	999
	have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what	999
	price they will.	999
	999
CONRADE	I wonder at it.	999
	999
BORACHIO	That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that	999
	the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is	999
	nothing to a man.	999
	999
CONRADE	Yes, it is apparel.	999
	999
BORACHIO	I mean, the fashion.	999
	999
CONRADE	Yes, the fashion is the fashion.	999
	999
BORACHIO	Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But	999
	seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion	999
	is?	999
	999
Watchman	[Aside]  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile	999
	thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a	999
	gentleman: I remember his name.	999
	999
BORACHIO	Didst thou not hear somebody?	999
	999
CONRADE	No; 'twas the vane on the house.	999
	999
BORACHIO	Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this	999
	fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot	999
	bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?	999
	sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers	999
	in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's	999
	priests in the old church-window, sometime like the	999
	shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,	999
	where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?	999
	999
CONRADE	All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears	999
	out more apparel than the man. But art not thou	999
	thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast	999
	shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?	999
	999
BORACHIO	Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night	999
	wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the	999
	name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'	999
	chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good	999
	night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first	999
	tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,	999
	planted and placed and possessed by my master Don	999
	John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.	999
	999
CONRADE	And thought they Margaret was Hero?	999
	999
BORACHIO	Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the	999
	devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly	999
	by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by	999
	the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly	999
	by my villany, which did confirm any slander that	999
	Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore	999
	he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning	999
	at the temple, and there, before the whole	999
	congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night	999
	and send her home again without a husband.	999
	999
First Watchman	We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!	999
	999
Second Watchman	Call up the right master constable. We have here	999
	recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that	999
	ever was known in the commonwealth.	999
	999
First Watchman	And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'	999
	wears a lock.	999
	999
CONRADE	Masters, masters,--	999
	999
Second Watchman	You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.	999
	999
CONRADE	Masters,--	999
	999
First Watchman	Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.	999
	999
BORACHIO	We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken	999
	up of these men's bills.	999
	999
CONRADE	A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.	999

	999
	[Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA]	999
	999
HERO	Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire	999
	her to rise.	999
	999
URSULA	I will, lady.	999
	999
HERO	And bid her come hither.	999
	999
URSULA	Well.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
MARGARET	Troth, I think your other rabato were better.	999
	999
HERO	No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.	999
	999
MARGARET	By my troth, 's not so good; and I warrant your	999
	cousin will say so.	999
	999
HERO	My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear	999
	none but this.	999
	999
MARGARET	I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair	999
	were a thought browner; and your gown's a most rare	999
	fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's	999
	gown that they praise so.	999
	999
HERO	O, that exceeds, they say.	999
	999
MARGARET	By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of	999
	yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with	999
	silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,	999
	and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:	999
	but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent	999
	fashion, yours is worth ten on 't.	999
	999
HERO	God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is	999
	exceeding heavy.	999
	999
MARGARET	'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.	999
	999
HERO	Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?	999
	999
MARGARET	Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not	999
	marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord	999
	honourable without marriage? I think you would have	999
	me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad	999
	thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend	999
	nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a	999
	husband'? None, I think, and it be the right husband	999
	and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not	999
	heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.	999
	999
	[Enter BEATRICE]	999
	999
HERO	Good morrow, coz.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Good morrow, sweet Hero.	999
	999
HERO	Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?	999
	999
BEATRICE	I am out of all other tune, methinks.	999
	999
MARGARET	Clap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without a	999
	burden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your	999
	husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall	999
	lack no barns.	999
	999
MARGARET	O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.	999
	999
BEATRICE	'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; tis time you were	999
	ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!	999
	999
MARGARET	For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?	999
	999
BEATRICE	For the letter that begins them all, H.	999
	999
MARGARET	Well, and you be not turned Turk, there's no more	999
	sailing by the star.	999
	999
BEATRICE	What means the fool, trow?	999
	999
MARGARET	Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!	999
	999
HERO	These gloves the count sent me; they are an	999
	excellent perfume.	999
	999
BEATRICE	I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.	999
	999
MARGARET	A maid, and stuffed! there's goodly catching of cold.	999
	999
BEATRICE	O, God help me! God help me! how long have you	999
	professed apprehension?	999
	999
MARGARET	Even since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?	999
	999
BEATRICE	It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your	999
	cap. By my troth, I am sick.	999
	999
MARGARET	Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,	999
	and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.	999
	999
HERO	There thou prickest her with a thistle.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in	999
	this Benedictus.	999
	999
MARGARET	Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I	999
	meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance	999
	that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am	999
	not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list	999
	not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,	999
	if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you	999
	are in love or that you will be in love or that you	999
	can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and	999
	now is he become a man: he swore he would never	999
	marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats	999
	his meat without grudging: and how you may be	999
	converted I know not, but methinks you look with	999
	your eyes as other women do.	999

BEATRICE	What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?	999
	999
MARGARET	Not a false gallop.	999

URSULA	Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior	999
	Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the	999
	town, are come to fetch you to church.	999
	999
HERO	Help to dress me, good coz, good Meg, good Ursula.	999

SCENE V	Another room in LEONATO'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LEONATO, with DOGBERRY and VERGES]	999
	999
LEONATO	What would you with me, honest neighbour?	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you	999
	that decerns you nearly.	999
	999
LEONATO	Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Marry, this it is, sir.	999
	999
VERGES	Yes, in truth it is, sir.	999
	999
LEONATO	What is it, my good friends?	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the	999
	matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so	999
	blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,	999
	in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.	999
	999
VERGES	Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living	999
	that is an old man and no honester than I.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.	999
	999
LEONATO	Neighbours, you are tedious.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the	999
	poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,	999
	if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in	999
	my heart to bestow it all of your worship.	999
	999
LEONATO	All thy tediousness on me, ah?	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for	999
	I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any	999
	man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I	999
	am glad to hear it.	999
	999
VERGES	And so am I.	999
	999
LEONATO	I would fain know what you have to say.	999
	999
VERGES	Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your	999
	worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant	999
	knaves as any in Messina.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as they	999
	say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help	999
	us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,	999
	neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men	999
	ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest	999
	soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever	999
	broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men	999
	are not alike; alas, good neighbour!	999
	999
LEONATO	Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Gifts that God gives.	999
	999
LEONATO	I must leave you.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed	999
	comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would	999
	have them this morning examined before your worship.	999
	999
LEONATO	Take their examination yourself and bring it me: I	999
	am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	It shall be suffigance.	999
	999
LEONATO	Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to	999
	her husband.	999
	999
LEONATO	I'll wait upon them: I am ready.	999
	999
	[Exeunt LEONATO and Messenger]	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;	999
	bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we	999
	are now to examination these men.	999
	999
VERGES	And we must do it wisely.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here's	999
	that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only	999
	get the learned writer to set down our	999
	excommunication and meet me at the gaol.	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A church.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, LEONATO, FRIAR FRANCIS,	999
	CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, HERO, BEATRICE, and Attendants]	999
	999
LEONATO	Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plain	999
	form of marriage, and you shall recount their	999
	particular duties afterwards.	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	No.	999
	999
LEONATO	To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.	999
	999
HERO	I do.	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	If either of you know any inward impediment why you	999
	should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,	999
	to utter it.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Know you any, Hero?	999
	999
HERO	None, my lord.	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	Know you any, count?	999
	999
LEONATO	I dare make his answer, none.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily	999
	do, not knowing what they do!	999
	999
BENEDICK	How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of	999
	laughing, as, ah, ha, he!	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:	999
	Will you with free and unconstrained soul	999
	Give me this maid, your daughter?	999
	999
LEONATO	As freely, son, as God did give her me.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	And what have I to give you back, whose worth	999
	May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Nothing, unless you render her again.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.	999
	There, Leonato, take her back again:	999
	Give not this rotten orange to your friend;	999
	She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.	999
	Behold how like a maid she blushes here!	999
	O, what authority and show of truth	999
	Can cunning sin cover itself withal!	999
	Comes not that blood as modest evidence	999
	To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,	999
	All you that see her, that she were a maid,	999
	By these exterior shows? But she is none:	999
	She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;	999
	Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.	999
	999
LEONATO	What do you mean, my lord?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Not to be married,	999
	Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.	999
	999
LEONATO	Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,	999
	Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,	999
	And made defeat of her virginity,--	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I know what you would say: if I have known her,	999
	You will say she did embrace me as a husband,	999
	And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:	999
	No, Leonato,	999
	I never tempted her with word too large;	999
	But, as a brother to his sister, show'd	999
	Bashful sincerity and comely love.	999
	999
HERO	And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:	999
	You seem to me as Dian in her orb,	999
	As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;	999
	But you are more intemperate in your blood	999
	Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals	999
	That rage in savage sensuality.	999
	999
HERO	Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?	999
	999
LEONATO	Sweet prince, why speak not you?	999
	999
DON PEDRO	What should I speak?	999
	I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about	999
	To link my dear friend to a common stale.	999
	999
LEONATO	Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?	999
	999
DON JOHN	Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.	999
	999
BENEDICK	This looks not like a nuptial.	999
	999
HERO	True! O God!	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Leonato, stand I here?	999
	Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?	999
	Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?	999
	999
LEONATO	All this is so: but what of this, my lord?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Let me but move one question to your daughter;	999
	And, by that fatherly and kindly power	999
	That you have in her, bid her answer truly.	999
	999
LEONATO	I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.	999
	999
HERO	O, God defend me! how am I beset!	999
	What kind of catechising call you this?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	To make you answer truly to your name.	999
	999
HERO	Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name	999
	With any just reproach?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Marry, that can Hero;	999
	Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.	999
	What man was he talk'd with you yesternight	999
	Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?	999
	Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.	999
	999
HERO	I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,	999
	I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,	999
	Myself, my brother and this grieved count	999
	Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night	999
	Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window	999
	Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,	999
	Confess'd the vile encounters they have had	999
	A thousand times in secret.	999
	999
DON JOHN	Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,	999
	Not to be spoke of;	999
	There is not chastity enough in language	999
	Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,	999
	I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,	999
	If half thy outward graces had been placed	999
	About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!	999
	But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,	999
	Thou pure impiety and impious purity!	999
	For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,	999
	And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,	999
	To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,	999
	And never shall it more be gracious.	999
	999
LEONATO	Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?	999
	999
	[HERO swoons]	999
	999
BEATRICE	Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?	999
	999
DON JOHN	Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,	999
	Smother her spirits up.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO]	999
	999
BENEDICK	How doth the lady?	999
	999
BEATRICE	                  Dead, I think. Help, uncle!	999
	Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!	999
	999
LEONATO	O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.	999
	Death is the fairest cover for her shame	999
	That may be wish'd for.	999
	999
BEATRICE	How now, cousin Hero!	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	Have comfort, lady.	999
	999
LEONATO	Dost thou look up?	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	Yea, wherefore should she not?	999
	999
LEONATO	Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing	999
	Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny	999
	The story that is printed in her blood?	999
	Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:	999
	For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,	999
	Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,	999
	Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,	999
	Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?	999
	Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?	999
	O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?	999
	Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?	999
	Why had I not with charitable hand	999
	Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,	999
	Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,	999
	I might have said 'No part of it is mine;	999
	This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?	999
	But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised	999
	And mine that I was proud on, mine so much	999
	That I myself was to myself not mine,	999
	Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen	999
	Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea	999
	Hath drops too few to wash her clean again	999
	And salt too little which may season give	999
	To her foul-tainted flesh!	999
	999
BENEDICK	Sir, sir, be patient.	999
	For my part, I am so attired in wonder,	999
	I know not what to say.	999
	999
BEATRICE	O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!	999
	999
BENEDICK	Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?	999
	999
BEATRICE	No, truly not; although, until last night,	999
	I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.	999
	999
LEONATO	Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made	999
	Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!	999
	Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,	999
	Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,	999
	Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	Hear me a little; for I have only been	999
	Silent so long and given way unto	999
	This course of fortune [           ]	999
	By noting of the lady I have mark'd	999
	A thousand blushing apparitions	999
	To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames	999
	In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;	999
	And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,	999
	To burn the errors that these princes hold	999
	Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;	999
	Trust not my reading nor my observations,	999
	Which with experimental seal doth warrant	999
	The tenor of my book; trust not my age,	999
	My reverence, calling, nor divinity,	999
	If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here	999
	Under some biting error.	999
	999
LEONATO	Friar, it cannot be.	999
	Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left	999
	Is that she will not add to her damnation	999
	A sin of perjury; she not denies it:	999
	Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse	999
	That which appears in proper nakedness?	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	Lady, what man is he you are accused of?	999
	999
HERO	They know that do accuse me; I know none:	999
	If I know more of any man alive	999
	Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,	999
	Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,	999
	Prove you that any man with me conversed	999
	At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight	999
	Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,	999
	Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	There is some strange misprision in the princes.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Two of them have the very bent of honour;	999
	And if their wisdoms be misled in this,	999
	The practise of it lives in John the bastard,	999
	Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.	999
	999
LEONATO	I know not. If they speak but truth of her,	999
	These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,	999
	The proudest of them shall well hear of it.	999
	Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,	999
	Nor age so eat up my invention,	999
	Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,	999
	Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,	999
	But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,	999
	Both strength of limb and policy of mind,	999
	Ability in means and choice of friends,	999
	To quit me of them throughly.	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	Pause awhile,	999
	And let my counsel sway you in this case.	999
	Your daughter here the princes left for dead:	999
	Let her awhile be secretly kept in,	999
	And publish it that she is dead indeed;	999
	Maintain a mourning ostentation	999
	And on your family's old monument	999
	Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites	999
	That appertain unto a burial.	999
	999
LEONATO	What shall become of this? what will this do?	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf	999
	Change slander to remorse; that is some good:	999
	But not for that dream I on this strange course,	999
	But on this travail look for greater birth.	999
	She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,	999
	Upon the instant that she was accused,	999
	Shall be lamented, pitied and excused	999
	Of every hearer: for it so falls out	999
	That what we have we prize not to the worth	999
	Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,	999
	Why, then we rack the value, then we find	999
	The virtue that possession would not show us	999
	Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:	999
	When he shall hear she died upon his words,	999
	The idea of her life shall sweetly creep	999
	Into his study of imagination,	999
	And every lovely organ of her life	999
	Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,	999
	More moving-delicate and full of life,	999
	Into the eye and prospect of his soul,	999
	Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,	999
	If ever love had interest in his liver,	999
	And wish he had not so accused her,	999
	No, though he thought his accusation true.	999
	Let this be so, and doubt not but success	999
	Will fashion the event in better shape	999
	Than I can lay it down in likelihood.	999
	But if all aim but this be levell'd false,	999
	The supposition of the lady's death	999
	Will quench the wonder of her infamy:	999
	And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,	999
	As best befits her wounded reputation,	999
	In some reclusive and religious life,	999
	Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:	999
	And though you know my inwardness and love	999
	Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,	999
	Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this	999
	As secretly and justly as your soul	999
	Should with your body.	999
	999
LEONATO	Being that I flow in grief,	999
	The smallest twine may lead me.	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	'Tis well consented: presently away;	999
	For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.	999
	Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day	999
	Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE]	999
	999
BENEDICK	Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?	999
	999
BEATRICE	Yea, and I will weep a while longer.	999
	999
BENEDICK	I will not desire that.	999
	999
BEATRICE	You have no reason; I do it freely.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!	999
	999
BENEDICK	Is there any way to show such friendship?	999
	999
BEATRICE	A very even way, but no such friend.	999
	999
BENEDICK	May a man do it?	999
	999
BEATRICE	It is a man's office, but not yours.	999
	999
BENEDICK	I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is	999
	not that strange?	999
	999
BEATRICE	As strange as the thing I know not. It were as	999
	possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as	999
	you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I	999
	confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.	999
	999
BENEDICK	By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Do not swear, and eat it.	999
	999
BENEDICK	I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make	999
	him eat it that says I love not you.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Will you not eat your word?	999
	999
BENEDICK	With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest	999
	I love thee.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Why, then, God forgive me!	999
	999
BENEDICK	What offence, sweet Beatrice?	999
	999
BEATRICE	You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to	999
	protest I loved you.	999
	999
BENEDICK	And do it with all thy heart.	999
	999
BEATRICE	I love you with so much of my heart that none is	999
	left to protest.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Come, bid me do any thing for thee.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Kill Claudio.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Ha! not for the wide world.	999
	999
BEATRICE	You kill me to deny it. Farewell.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Tarry, sweet Beatrice.	999
	999
BEATRICE	I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in	999
	you: nay, I pray you, let me go.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Beatrice,--	999
	999
BEATRICE	In faith, I will go.	999
	999
BENEDICK	We'll be friends first.	999
	999
BEATRICE	You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Is Claudio thine enemy?	999
	999
BEATRICE	Is he not approved in the height a villain, that	999
	hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O	999
	that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they	999
	come to take hands; and then, with public	999
	accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,	999
	--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart	999
	in the market-place.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Hear me, Beatrice,--	999
	999
BEATRICE	Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!	999
	999
BENEDICK	Nay, but, Beatrice,--	999
	999
BEATRICE	Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Beat--	999
	999
BEATRICE	Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,	999
	a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,	999
	surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I	999
	had any friend would be a man for my sake! But	999
	manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into	999
	compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and	999
	trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules	999
	that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a	999
	man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?	999
	999
BEATRICE	Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will	999
	kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,	999
	Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you	999
	hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your	999
	cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.	999

	999
	[Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and Sexton, in gowns; and	999
	the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO]	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Is our whole dissembly appeared?	999
	999
VERGES	O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.	999
	999
Sexton	Which be the malefactors?	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Marry, that am I and my partner.	999
	999
VERGES	Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.	999
	999
Sexton	But which are the offenders that are to be	999
	examined? let them come before master constable.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your	999
	name, friend?	999
	999
BORACHIO	Borachio.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Pray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?	999
	999
CONRADE	I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do	999
	you serve God?	999
	999
	999
CONRADE	|	999
	|  Yea, sir, we hope.	999
BORACHIO	|	999
	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Write down, that they hope they serve God: and	999
	write God first; for God defend but God should go	999
	before such villains! Masters, it is proved already	999
	that you are little better than false knaves; and it	999
	will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer	999
	you for yourselves?	999
	999
CONRADE	Marry, sir, we say we are none.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but I	999
	will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a	999
	word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought	999
	you are false knaves.	999
	999
BORACHIO	Sir, I say to you we are none.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a	999
	tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?	999
	999
Sexton	Master constable, you go not the way to examine:	999
	you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch	999
	come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's	999
	name, accuse these men.	999
	999
First Watchman	This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's	999
	brother, was a villain.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat	999
	perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.	999
	999
BORACHIO	Master constable,--	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,	999
	I promise thee.	999
	999
Sexton	What heard you him say else?	999
	999
Second Watchman	Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of	999
	Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Flat burglary as ever was committed.	999
	999
VERGES	Yea, by mass, that it is.	999
	999
Sexton	What else, fellow?	999
	999
First Watchman	And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to	999
	disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting	999
	redemption for this.	999
	999
Sexton	What else?	999
	999
Watchman	This is all.	999
	999
Sexton	And this is more, masters, than you can deny.	999
	Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;	999
	Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner	999
	refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.	999
	Master constable, let these men be bound, and	999
	brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show	999
	him their examination.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Come, let them be opinioned.	999
	999
VERGES	Let them be in the hands--	999
	999
CONRADE	Off, coxcomb!	999
	999
DOGBERRY	God's my life, where's the sexton? let him write	999
	down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.	999
	Thou naughty varlet!	999
	999
CONRADE	Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not	999
	suspect my years? O that he were here to write me	999
	down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an	999
	ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not	999
	that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of	999
	piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.	999
	I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,	999
	and, which is more, a householder, and, which is	999
	more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in	999
	Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a	999
	rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath	999
	had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every	999
	thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that	999
	I had been writ down an ass!	999

	999
SCENE I	Before LEONATO'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO]	999
	999
ANTONIO	If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:	999
	And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief	999
	Against yourself.	999
	999
LEONATO	                  I pray thee, cease thy counsel,	999
	Which falls into mine ears as profitless	999
	As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;	999
	Nor let no comforter delight mine ear	999
	But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.	999
	Bring me a father that so loved his child,	999
	Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,	999
	And bid him speak of patience;	999
	Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine	999
	And let it answer every strain for strain,	999
	As thus for thus and such a grief for such,	999
	In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:	999
	If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,	999
	Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,	999
	Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk	999
	With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,	999
	And I of him will gather patience.	999
	But there is no such man: for, brother, men	999
	Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief	999
	Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,	999
	Their counsel turns to passion, which before	999
	Would give preceptial medicine to rage,	999
	Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,	999
	Charm ache with air and agony with words:	999
	No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience	999
	To those that wring under the load of sorrow,	999
	But no man's virtue nor sufficiency	999
	To be so moral when he shall endure	999
	The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:	999
	My griefs cry louder than advertisement.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Therein do men from children nothing differ.	999
	999
LEONATO	I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;	999
	For there was never yet philosopher	999
	That could endure the toothache patiently,	999
	However they have writ the style of gods	999
	And made a push at chance and sufferance.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;	999
	Make those that do offend you suffer too.	999
	999
LEONATO	There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.	999
	My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;	999
	And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince	999
	And all of them that thus dishonour her.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.	999
	999
	[Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Good den, good den.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Good day to both of you.	999
	999
LEONATO	Hear you. my lords,--	999
	999
DON PEDRO	We have some haste, Leonato.	999
	999
LEONATO	Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:	999
	Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.	999
	999
ANTONIO	If he could right himself with quarreling,	999
	Some of us would lie low.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Who wrongs him?	999
	999
LEONATO	Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:--	999
	Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;	999
	I fear thee not.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	                  Marry, beshrew my hand,	999
	If it should give your age such cause of fear:	999
	In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.	999
	999
LEONATO	Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:	999
	I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,	999
	As under privilege of age to brag	999
	What I have done being young, or what would do	999
	Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,	999
	Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me	999
	That I am forced to lay my reverence by	999
	And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,	999
	Do challenge thee to trial of a man.	999
	I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;	999
	Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,	999
	And she lies buried with her ancestors;	999
	O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,	999
	Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!	999
	999
CLAUDIO	My villany?	999
	999
LEONATO	          Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	You say not right, old man.	999
	999
LEONATO	My lord, my lord,	999
	I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,	999
	Despite his nice fence and his active practise,	999
	His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Away! I will not have to do with you.	999
	999
LEONATO	Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:	999
	If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.	999
	999
ANTONIO	He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:	999
	But that's no matter; let him kill one first;	999
	Win me and wear me; let him answer me.	999
	Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:	999
	Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;	999
	Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.	999
	999
LEONATO	Brother,--	999
	999
ANTONIO	Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;	999
	And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,	999
	That dare as well answer a man indeed	999
	As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:	999
	Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!	999
	999
LEONATO	Brother Antony,--	999
	999
ANTONIO	Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,	999
	And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--	999
	Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,	999
	That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,	999
	Go anticly, show outward hideousness,	999
	And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,	999
	How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;	999
	And this is all.	999
	999
LEONATO	But, brother Antony,--	999
	999
ANTONIO	Come, 'tis no matter:	999
	Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.	999
	My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:	999
	But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing	999
	But what was true and very full of proof.	999
	999
LEONATO	My lord, my lord,--	999
	999
DON PEDRO	I will not hear you.	999
	999
LEONATO	No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.	999
	999
ANTONIO	And shall, or some of us will smart for it.	999
	999
	[Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.	999
	999
	[Enter BENEDICK]	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Now, signior, what news?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Good day, my lord.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part	999
	almost a fray.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	We had like to have had our two noses snapped off	999
	with two old men without teeth.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had	999
	we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.	999
	999
BENEDICK	In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came	999
	to seek you both.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are	999
	high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten	999
	away. Wilt thou use thy wit?	999
	999
BENEDICK	It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Never any did so, though very many have been beside	999
	their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the	999
	minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou	999
	sick, or angry?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,	999
	thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you	999
	charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was	999
	broke cross.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	By this light, he changes more and more: I think	999
	he be angry indeed.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Shall I speak a word in your ear?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	God bless me from a challenge!	999
	999
BENEDICK	[Aside to CLAUDIO]  You are a villain; I jest not:	999
	I will make it good how you dare, with what you	999
	dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will	999
	protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet	999
	lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me	999
	hear from you.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	What, a feast, a feast?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's	999
	head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most	999
	curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find	999
	a woodcock too?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the	999
	other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'	999
	said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a	999
	great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'	999
	'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it	999
	hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman	999
	is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'	999
	'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I	999
	believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on	999
	Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;	999
	there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus	999
	did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular	999
	virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou	999
	wast the properest man in Italy.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	For the which she wept heartily and said she cared	999
	not.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she	999
	did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:	999
	the old man's daughter told us all.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was	999
	hid in the garden.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on	999
	the sensible Benedick's head?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the	999
	married man'?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave	999
	you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests	999
	as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,	999
	hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank	999
	you: I must discontinue your company: your brother	999
	the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among	999
	you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord	999
	Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till	999
	then, peace be with him.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	He is in earnest.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for	999
	the love of Beatrice.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	And hath challenged thee.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Most sincerely.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his	999
	doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!	999
	999
CLAUDIO	He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a	999
	doctor to such a man.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	But, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, and	999
	be sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?	999
	999
	[Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and the Watch, with CONRADE	999
	and BORACHIO]	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she	999
	shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,	999
	an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio	999
	one!	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Hearken after their offence, my lord.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Officers, what offence have these men done?	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Marry, sir, they have committed false report;	999
	moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,	999
	they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have	999
	belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust	999
	things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I	999
	ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why	999
	they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay	999
	to their charge.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, by	999
	my troth, there's one meaning well suited.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus	999
	bound to your answer? this learned constable is	999
	too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?	999
	999
BORACHIO	Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:	999
	do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have	999
	deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms	999
	could not discover, these shallow fools have brought	999
	to light: who in the night overheard me confessing	999
	to this man how Don John your brother incensed me	999
	to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into	999
	the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's	999
	garments, how you disgraced her, when you should	999
	marry her: my villany they have upon record; which	999
	I had rather seal with my death than repeat over	999
	to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my	999
	master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire	999
	nothing but the reward of a villain.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	But did my brother set thee on to this?	999
	999
BORACHIO	Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	He is composed and framed of treachery:	999
	And fled he is upon this villany.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear	999
	In the rare semblance that I loved it first.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our	999
	sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:	999
	and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time	999
	and place shall serve, that I am an ass.	999
	999
VERGES	Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and the	999
	Sexton too.	999
	999
	[Re-enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, with the Sexton]	999
	999
LEONATO	Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,	999
	That, when I note another man like him,	999
	I may avoid him: which of these is he?	999
	999
BORACHIO	If you would know your wronger, look on me.	999
	999
LEONATO	Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd	999
	Mine innocent child?	999
	999
BORACHIO	Yea, even I alone.	999
	999
LEONATO	No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:	999
	Here stand a pair of honourable men;	999
	A third is fled, that had a hand in it.	999
	I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:	999
	Record it with your high and worthy deeds:	999
	'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I know not how to pray your patience;	999
	Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;	999
	Impose me to what penance your invention	999
	Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not	999
	But in mistaking.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	                  By my soul, nor I:	999
	And yet, to satisfy this good old man,	999
	I would bend under any heavy weight	999
	That he'll enjoin me to.	999
	999
LEONATO	I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;	999
	That were impossible: but, I pray you both,	999
	Possess the people in Messina here	999
	How innocent she died; and if your love	999
	Can labour ought in sad invention,	999
	Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb	999
	And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:	999
	To-morrow morning come you to my house,	999
	And since you could not be my son-in-law,	999
	Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,	999
	Almost the copy of my child that's dead,	999
	And she alone is heir to both of us:	999
	Give her the right you should have given her cousin,	999
	And so dies my revenge.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	O noble sir,	999
	Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!	999
	I do embrace your offer; and dispose	999
	For henceforth of poor Claudio.	999
	999
LEONATO	To-morrow then I will expect your coming;	999
	To-night I take my leave. This naughty man	999
	Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,	999
	Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,	999
	Hired to it by your brother.	999
	999
BORACHIO	No, by my soul, she was not,	999
	Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,	999
	But always hath been just and virtuous	999
	In any thing that I do know by her.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and	999
	black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call	999
	me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his	999
	punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of	999
	one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and	999
	a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's	999
	name, the which he hath used so long and never paid	999
	that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing	999
	for God's sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.	999
	999
LEONATO	I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	Your worship speaks like a most thankful and	999
	reverend youth; and I praise God for you.	999
	999
LEONATO	There's for thy pains.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	God save the foundation!	999
	999
LEONATO	Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.	999
	999
DOGBERRY	I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I	999
	beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the	999
	example of others. God keep your worship! I wish	999
	your worship well; God restore you to health! I	999
	humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry	999
	meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES]	999
	999
LEONATO	Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	We will not fail.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	                  To-night I'll mourn with Hero.	999
	999
LEONATO	[To the Watch]  Bring you these fellows on. We'll	999
	talk with Margaret,	999
	How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.	999

	999
	[Enter BENEDICK and MARGARET, meeting]	999
	999
BENEDICK	Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at	999
	my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.	999
	999
MARGARET	Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?	999
	999
BENEDICK	In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living	999
	shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou	999
	deservest it.	999
	999
MARGARET	To have no man come over me! why, shall I always	999
	keep below stairs?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.	999
	999
MARGARET	And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,	999
	but hurt not.	999
	999
BENEDICK	A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a	999
	woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give	999
	thee the bucklers.	999
	999
MARGARET	Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.	999
	999
BENEDICK	If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the	999
	pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.	999
	999
MARGARET	Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.	999
	999
BENEDICK	And therefore will come.	999
	999
	[Exit MARGARET]	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	The god of love,	999
	That sits above,	999
	And knows me, and knows me,	999
	How pitiful I deserve,--	999
	999
	I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good	999
	swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and	999
	a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,	999
	whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a	999
	blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned	999
	over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I	999
	cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find	999
	out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent	999
	rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,	999
	'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous	999
	endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,	999
	nor I cannot woo in festival terms.	999
	999
	[Enter BEATRICE]	999
	999
	Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?	999
	999
BEATRICE	Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.	999
	999
BENEDICK	O, stay but till then!	999
	999
BEATRICE	'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere	999
	I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with	999
	knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but	999
	foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I	999
	will depart unkissed.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,	999
	so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee	999
	plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either	999
	I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe	999
	him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for	999
	which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?	999
	999
BEATRICE	For them all together; which maintained so politic	999
	a state of evil that they will not admit any good	999
	part to intermingle with them. But for which of my	999
	good parts did you first suffer love for me?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love	999
	indeed, for I love thee against my will.	999
	999
BEATRICE	In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!	999
	If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for	999
	yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.	999
	999
BEATRICE	It appears not in this confession: there's not one	999
	wise man among twenty that will praise himself.	999
	999
BENEDICK	An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in	999
	the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect	999
	in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live	999
	no longer in monument than the bell rings and the	999
	widow weeps.	999
	999
BEATRICE	And how long is that, think you?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in	999
	rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the	999
	wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no	999
	impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his	999
	own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for	999
	praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is	999
	praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?	999
	999
BEATRICE	Very ill.	999
	999
BENEDICK	And how do you?	999
	999
BEATRICE	Very ill too.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave	999
	you too, for here comes one in haste.	999
	999
	[Enter URSULA]	999
	999
URSULA	Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old	999
	coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been	999
	falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily	999
	abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is	999
	fed and gone. Will you come presently?	999
	999
BEATRICE	Will you go hear this news, signior?	999
	999
BENEDICK	I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be	999
	buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with	999
	thee to thy uncle's.	999

	999
CLAUDIO	Is this the monument of Leonato?	999
	999
Lord	It is, my lord.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	[Reading out of a scroll]	999
	Done to death by slanderous tongues	999
	Was the Hero that here lies:	999
	Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,	999
	Gives her fame which never dies.	999
	So the life that died with shame	999
	Lives in death with glorious fame.	999
	Hang thou there upon the tomb,	999
	Praising her when I am dumb.	999
	999
	Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.	999
	SONG.	999
	999
	Pardon, goddess of the night,	999
	Those that slew thy virgin knight;	999
	For the which, with songs of woe,	999
	Round about her tomb they go.	999
	Midnight, assist our moan;	999
	Help us to sigh and groan,	999
	Heavily, heavily:	999
	Graves, yawn and yield your dead,	999
	Till death be uttered,	999
	Heavily, heavily.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	     Now, unto thy bones good night!	999
	Yearly will I do this rite.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:	999
	The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,	999
	Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about	999
	Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.	999
	Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	     Good morrow, masters: each his several way.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;	999
	And then to Leonato's we will go.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's	999
	Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.	999

	999
	[Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, BENEDICK, BEATRICE,	999
	MARGARET, URSULA, FRIAR FRANCIS, and HERO]	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	Did I not tell you she was innocent?	999
	999
LEONATO	So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her	999
	Upon the error that you heard debated:	999
	But Margaret was in some fault for this,	999
	Although against her will, as it appears	999
	In the true course of all the question.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.	999
	999
BENEDICK	And so am I, being else by faith enforced	999
	To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.	999
	999
LEONATO	Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,	999
	Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,	999
	And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Ladies]	999
	999
	The prince and Claudio promised by this hour	999
	To visit me. You know your office, brother:	999
	You must be father to your brother's daughter	999
	And give her to young Claudio.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	To do what, signior?	999
	999
BENEDICK	To bind me, or undo me; one of them.	999
	Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,	999
	Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.	999
	999
LEONATO	That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.	999
	999
BENEDICK	And I do with an eye of love requite her.	999
	999
LEONATO	The sight whereof I think you had from me,	999
	From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:	999
	But, for my will, my will is your good will	999
	May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd	999
	In the state of honourable marriage:	999
	In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.	999
	999
LEONATO	My heart is with your liking.	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	And my help.	999
	Here comes the prince and Claudio.	999
	999
	[Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or	999
	three others]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Good morrow to this fair assembly.	999
	999
LEONATO	Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:	999
	We here attend you. Are you yet determined	999
	To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.	999
	999
LEONATO	Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.	999
	999
	[Exit ANTONIO]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,	999
	That you have such a February face,	999
	So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I think he thinks upon the savage bull.	999
	Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold	999
	And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,	999
	As once Europa did at lusty Jove,	999
	When he would play the noble beast in love.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;	999
	And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,	999
	And got a calf in that same noble feat	999
	Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.	999
	999
	[Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked]	999
	999
	Which is the lady I must seize upon?	999
	999
ANTONIO	This same is she, and I do give you her.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.	999
	999
LEONATO	No, that you shall not, till you take her hand	999
	Before this friar and swear to marry her.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Give me your hand: before this holy friar,	999
	I am your husband, if you like of me.	999
	999
HERO	And when I lived, I was your other wife:	999
	999
	[Unmasking]	999
	999
	And when you loved, you were my other husband.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	Another Hero!	999
	999
HERO	                  Nothing certainer:	999
	One Hero died defiled, but I do live,	999
	And surely as I live, I am a maid.	999
	999
DON PEDRO	The former Hero! Hero that is dead!	999
	999
LEONATO	She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.	999
	999
FRIAR FRANCIS	All this amazement can I qualify:	999
	When after that the holy rites are ended,	999
	I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:	999
	Meantime let wonder seem familiar,	999
	And to the chapel let us presently.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?	999
	999
BEATRICE	[Unmasking]  I answer to that name. What is your will?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Do not you love me?	999
	999
BEATRICE	Why, no; no more than reason.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio	999
	Have been deceived; they swore you did.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Do not you love me?	999
	999
BENEDICK	Troth, no; no more than reason.	999
	999
BEATRICE	Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula	999
	Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.	999
	999
BENEDICK	They swore that you were almost sick for me.	999
	999
BEATRICE	They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.	999
	999
BENEDICK	'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?	999
	999
BEATRICE	No, truly, but in friendly recompense.	999
	999
LEONATO	Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;	999
	For here's a paper written in his hand,	999
	A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,	999
	Fashion'd to Beatrice.	999
	999
HERO	And here's another	999
	Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,	999
	Containing her affection unto Benedick.	999
	999
BENEDICK	A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.	999
	Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take	999
	thee for pity.	999
	999
BEATRICE	I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield	999
	upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,	999
	for I was told you were in a consumption.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Peace! I will stop your mouth.	999
	999
	[Kissing her]	999
	999
DON PEDRO	How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?	999
	999
BENEDICK	I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of	999
	wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost	999
	thou think I  care for a satire or an epigram? No:	999
	if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear	999
	nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do	999
	purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any	999
	purpose that the world can say against it; and	999
	therefore never flout at me for what I have said	999
	against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my	999
	conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to	999
	have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my	999
	kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.	999
	999
CLAUDIO	I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,	999
	that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single	999
	life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of	999
	question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look	999
	exceedingly narrowly to thee.	999
	999
BENEDICK	Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere	999
	we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts	999
	and our wives' heels.	999
	999
LEONATO	We'll have dancing afterward.	999
	999

	999
	999
	[Enter GOWER]	999
	999
	[Before the palace of Antioch]	999
	999
	To sing a song that old was sung,	999
	From ashes ancient Gower is come;	999
	Assuming man's infirmities,	999
	To glad your ear, and please your eyes.	999
	It hath been sung at festivals,	999
	On ember-eves and holy-ales;	999
	And lords and ladies in their lives	999
	Have read it for restoratives:	999
	The purchase is to make men glorious;	999
	Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.	999
	If you, born in these latter times,	999
	When wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes.	999
	And that to hear an old man sing	999
	May to your wishes pleasure bring	999
	I life would wish, and that I might	999
	Waste it for you, like taper-light.	999
	This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great	999
	Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:	999
	The fairest in all Syria,	999
	I tell you what mine authors say:	999
	This king unto him took a fere,	999
	Who died and left a female heir,	999
	So buxom, blithe, and full of face,	999
	As heaven had lent her all his grace;	999
	With whom the father liking took,	999
	And her to incest did provoke:	999
	Bad child; worse father! to entice his own	999
	To evil should be done by none:	999
	But custom what they did begin	999
	Was with long use account no sin.	999
	The beauty of this sinful dame	999
	Made many princes thither frame,	999
	To seek her as a bed-fellow,	999
	In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:	999
	Which to prevent he made a law,	999
	To keep her still, and men in awe,	999
	That whoso ask'd her for his wife,	999
	His riddle told not, lost his life:	999
	So for her many a wight did die,	999
	As yon grim looks do testify.	999
	What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye	999
	I give, my cause who best can justify.	999

	999
SCENE I	Antioch. A room in the palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followers]	999
	999
ANTIOCHUS	Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received	999
	The danger of the task you undertake.	999
	999
PERICLES	I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul	999
	Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,	999
	Think death no hazard in this enterprise.	999
	999
ANTIOCHUS	Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,	999
	For the embracements even of Jove himself;	999
	At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,	999
	Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,	999
	The senate-house of planets all did sit,	999
	To knit in her their best perfections.	999
	999
	[Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS]	999
	999
PERICLES	See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,	999
	Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king	999
	Of every virtue gives renown to men!	999
	Her face the book of praises, where is read	999
	Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence	999
	Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath	999
	Could never be her mild companion.	999
	You gods that made me man, and sway in love,	999
	That have inflamed desire in my breast	999
	To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,	999
	Or die in the adventure, be my helps,	999
	As I am son and servant to your will,	999
	To compass such a boundless happiness!	999
	999
ANTIOCHUS	Prince Pericles,--	999
	999
PERICLES	That would be son to great Antiochus.	999
	999
ANTIOCHUS	Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,	999
	With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;	999
	For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:	999
	Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view	999
	Her countless glory, which desert must gain;	999
	And which, without desert, because thine eye	999
	Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.	999
	Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,	999
	Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,	999
	Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,	999
	That without covering, save yon field of stars,	999
	Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;	999
	And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist	999
	For going on death's net, whom none resist.	999
	999
PERICLES	Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught	999
	My frail mortality to know itself,	999
	And by those fearful objects to prepare	999
	This body, like to them, to what I must;	999
	For death remember'd should be like a mirror,	999
	Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.	999
	I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do	999
	Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,	999
	Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;	999
	So I bequeath a happy peace to you	999
	And all good men, as every prince should do;	999
	My riches to the earth from whence they came;	999
	But my unspotted fire of love to you.	999
	999
	[To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS]	999
	999
	Thus ready for the way of life or death,	999
	I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.	999
	999
ANTIOCHUS	Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:	999
	Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,	999
	As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.	999
	999
Daughter	Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!	999
	Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!	999
	999
PERICLES	Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,	999
	Nor ask advice of any other thought	999
	But faithfulness and courage.	999
	999
	[He reads the riddle]	999
	999
	I am no viper, yet I feed	999
	On mother's flesh which did me breed.	999
	I sought a husband, in which labour	999
	I found that kindness in a father:	999
	He's father, son, and husband mild;	999
	I mother, wife, and yet his child.	999
	How they may be, and yet in two,	999
	As you will live, resolve it you.	999
	999
	Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers	999
	That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,	999
	Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,	999
	If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?	999
	Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,	999
	999
	[Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS]	999
	999
	Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:	999
	But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt	999
	For he's no man on whom perfections wait	999
	That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.	999
	You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;	999
	Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,	999
	Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:	999
	But being play'd upon before your time,	999
	Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.	999
	Good sooth, I care not for you.	999
	999
ANTIOCHUS	Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.	999
	For that's an article within our law,	999
	As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:	999
	Either expound now, or receive your sentence.	999
	999
PERICLES	Great king,	999
	Few love to hear the sins they love to act;	999
	'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.	999
	Who has a book of all that monarchs do,	999
	He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:	999
	For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.	999
	Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;	999
	And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,	999
	The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:	999
	To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts	999
	Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd	999
	By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.	999
	Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's	999
	their will;	999
	And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?	999
	It is enough you know; and it is fit,	999
	What being more known grows worse, to smother it.	999
	All love the womb that their first being bred,	999
	Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.	999
	999
ANTIOCHUS	[Aside]  Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found	999
	the meaning:	999
	But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,	999
	Though by the tenor of our strict edict,	999
	Your exposition misinterpreting,	999
	We might proceed to cancel of your days;	999
	Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree	999
	As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:	999
	Forty days longer we do respite you;	999
	If by which time our secret be undone,	999
	This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:	999
	And until then your entertain shall be	999
	As doth befit our honour and your worth.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but PERICLES]	999
	999
PERICLES	How courtesy would seem to cover sin,	999
	When what is done is like an hypocrite,	999
	The which is good in nothing but in sight!	999
	If it be true that I interpret false,	999
	Then were it certain you were not so bad	999
	As with foul incest to abuse your soul;	999
	Where now you're both a father and a son,	999
	By your untimely claspings with your child,	999
	Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;	999
	And she an eater of her mother's flesh,	999
	By the defiling of her parent's bed;	999
	And both like serpents are, who though they feed	999
	On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.	999
	Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men	999
	Blush not in actions blacker than the night,	999
	Will shun no course to keep them from the light.	999
	One sin, I know, another doth provoke;	999
	Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:	999
	Poison and treason are the hands of sin,	999
	Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:	999
	Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,	999
	By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Re-enter ANTIOCHUS]	999
	999
ANTIOCHUS	He hath found the meaning, for which we mean	999
	To have his head.	999
	He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,	999
	Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin	999
	In such a loathed manner;	999
	And therefore instantly this prince must die:	999
	For by his fall my honour must keep high.	999
	Who attends us there?	999
	999
	[Enter THALIARD]	999
	999
THALIARD	Doth your highness call?	999
	999
ANTIOCHUS	Thaliard,	999
	You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes	999
	Her private actions to your secrecy;	999
	And for your faithfulness we will advance you.	999
	Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;	999
	We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:	999
	It fits thee not to ask the reason why,	999
	Because we bid it. Say, is it done?	999
	999
THALIARD	My lord,	999
	'Tis done.	999
	999
ANTIOCHUS	         Enough.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
	Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.	999
	999
Messenger	My lord, prince Pericles is fled.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ANTIOCHUS	As thou	999
	Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot	999
	From a well-experienced archer hits the mark	999
	His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return	999
	Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'	999
	999
THALIARD	My lord,	999
	If I can get him within my pistol's length,	999
	I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.	999
	999
ANTIOCHUS	Thaliard, adieu!	999
	999
	[Exit THALIARD]	999

ACT I	999

	999
	999
SCENE II	Tyre. A room in the palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PERICLES]	999
	999
PERICLES	[To Lords without]  Let none disturb us.--Why should	999
	this change of thoughts,	999
	The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,	999
	Be my so used a guest as not an hour,	999
	In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,	999
	The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?	999
	Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,	999
	And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,	999
	Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:	999
	Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,	999
	Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.	999
	Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,	999
	That have their first conception by mis-dread,	999
	Have after-nourishment and life by care;	999
	And what was first but fear what might be done,	999
	Grows elder now and cares it be not done.	999
	And so with me: the great Antiochus,	999
	'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,	999
	Since he's so great can make his will his act,	999
	Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;	999
	Nor boots it me to say I honour him.	999
	If he suspect I may dishonour him:	999
	And what may make him blush in being known,	999
	He'll stop the course by which it might be known;	999
	With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,	999
	And with the ostent of war will look so huge,	999
	Amazement shall drive courage from the state;	999
	Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,	999
	And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:	999
	Which care of them, not pity of myself,	999
	Who am no more but as the tops of trees,	999
	Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,	999
	Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,	999
	And punish that before that he would punish.	999
	999
	[Enter HELICANUS, with other Lords]	999
	999
First Lord	Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!	999
	999
Second Lord	And keep your mind, till you return to us,	999
	Peaceful and comfortable!	999
	999
HELICANUS	Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.	999
	They do abuse the king that flatter him:	999
	For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;	999
	The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,	999
	To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;	999
	Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,	999
	Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.	999
	When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,	999
	He flatters you, makes war upon your life.	999
	Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;	999
	I cannot be much lower than my knees.	999
	999
PERICLES	All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook	999
	What shipping and what lading's in our haven,	999
	And then return to us.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Lords]	999
	999
		 Helicanus, thou	999
	Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?	999
	999
HELICANUS	An angry brow, dread lord.	999
	999
PERICLES	If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,	999
	How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?	999
	999
HELICANUS	How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence	999
	They have their nourishment?	999
	999
PERICLES	Thou know'st I have power	999
	To take thy life from thee.	999
	999
HELICANUS	[Kneeling]	999
	999
		     I have ground the axe myself;	999
	Do you but strike the blow.	999
	999
PERICLES	Rise, prithee, rise.	999
	Sit down: thou art no flatterer:	999
	I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid	999
	That kings should let their ears hear their	999
	faults hid!	999
	Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,	999
	Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,	999
	What wouldst thou have me do?	999
	999
HELICANUS	To bear with patience	999
	Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.	999
	999
PERICLES	Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,	999
	That minister'st a potion unto me	999
	That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.	999
	Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,	999
	Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,	999
	I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.	999
	From whence an issue I might propagate,	999
	Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.	999
	Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;	999
	The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:	999
	Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father	999
	Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou	999
	know'st this,	999
	'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.	999
	Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,	999
	Under the covering of a careful night,	999
	Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,	999
	Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.	999
	I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears	999
	Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:	999
	And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,	999
	That I should open to the listening air	999
	How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,	999
	To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,	999
	To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,	999
	And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:	999
	When all, for mine, if I may call offence,	999
	Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:	999
	Which love to all, of which thyself art one,	999
	Who now reprovest me for it,--	999
	999
HELICANUS	Alas, sir!	999
	999
PERICLES	Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,	999
	Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts	999
	How I might stop this tempest ere it came;	999
	And finding little comfort to relieve them,	999
	I thought it princely charity to grieve them.	999
	999
HELICANUS	Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.	999
	Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,	999
	And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,	999
	Who either by public war or private treason	999
	Will take away your life.	999
	Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,	999
	Till that his rage and anger be forgot,	999

PERICLES	Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus	999
	Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee;	999
	And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.	999
	The care I had and have of subjects' good	999
	On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.	999
	I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:	999
	Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:	999
	But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,	999

	[Enter THALIARD]	999
	999
THALIARD	So, this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I	999
	kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to	999
	be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive	999
	he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,	999
	being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired	999
	he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he	999
	had some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be a	999
	villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to	999
	be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.	999
	999
	[Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES, with other Lords of Tyre]	999
	999
HELICANUS	You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,	999
	Further to question me of your king's departure:	999
	His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,	999
	Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.	999
	999
THALIARD	[Aside]  How! the king gone!	999
	999
HELICANUS	If further yet you will be satisfied,	999
	Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,	999
	He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.	999
	Being at Antioch--	999
	999
THALIARD	[Aside]          What from Antioch?	999
	999
HELICANUS	Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--	999
	Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:	999
	And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,	999
	To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;	999
	So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,	999
	With whom each minute threatens life or death.	999
	999
THALIARD	[Aside]  Well, I perceive	999
	I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;	999
	But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:	999
	He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.	999
	I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!	999
	999
HELICANUS	Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.	999
	999
THALIARD	From him I come	999
	With message unto princely Pericles;	999
	But since my landing I have understood	999
	Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,	999
	My message must return from whence it came.	999
	999
HELICANUS	We have no reason to desire it,	999
	Commended to our master, not to us:	999
	Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,	999
	As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.	999

SCENE IV	Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA,	999
	and others]	999
	999
CLEON	My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,	999
	And by relating tales of others' griefs,	999
	See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?	999
	999
DIONYZA	That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;	999
	For who digs hills because they do aspire	999
	Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.	999
	O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;	999
	Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,	999
	But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.	999
	999
CLEON	O Dionyza,	999
	Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,	999
	Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?	999
	Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep	999
	Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,	999
	Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;	999
	That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,	999
	They may awake their helps to comfort them.	999
	I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,	999
	And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.	999
	999
DIONYZA	I'll do my best, sir.	999
	999
CLEON	This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,	999
	A city on whom plenty held full hand,	999
	For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;	999
	Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,	999
	And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;	999
	Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,	999
	Like one another's glass to trim them by:	999
	Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,	999
	And not so much to feed on as delight;	999
	All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,	999
	The name of help grew odious to repeat.	999
	999
DIONYZA	O, 'tis too true.	999
	999
CLEON	But see what heaven can do! By this our change,	999
	These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,	999
	Were all too little to content and please,	999
	Although they gave their creatures in abundance,	999
	As houses are defiled for want of use,	999
	They are now starved for want of exercise:	999
	Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,	999
	Must have inventions to delight the taste,	999
	Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:	999
	Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,	999
	Thought nought too curious, are ready now	999
	To eat those little darlings whom they loved.	999
	So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife	999
	Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:	999
	Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;	999
	Here many sink, yet those which see them fall	999
	Have scarce strength left to give them burial.	999
	Is not this true?	999
	999
DIONYZA	Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.	999
	999
CLEON	O, let those cities that of plenty's cup	999
	And her prosperities so largely taste,	999
	With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!	999
	The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.	999
	999
	[Enter a Lord]	999
	999
Lord	Where's the lord governor?	999
	999
CLEON	Here.	999
	Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,	999
	For comfort is too far for us to expect.	999
	999
Lord	We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,	999
	A portly sail of ships make hitherward.	999
	999
CLEON	I thought as much.	999
	One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,	999
	That may succeed as his inheritor;	999
	And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,	999
	Taking advantage of our misery,	999
	Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,	999
	To beat us down, the which are down already;	999
	And make a conquest of unhappy me,	999
	Whereas no glory's got to overcome.	999
	999
Lord	That's the least fear; for, by the semblance	999
	Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,	999
	And come to us as favourers, not as foes.	999
	999
CLEON	Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:	999
	Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.	999
	But bring they what they will and what they can,	999
	What need we fear?	999
	The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.	999
	Go tell their general we attend him here,	999
	To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,	999
	And what he craves.	999
	999
Lord	I go, my lord.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999

CLEON	Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;	999

	999
PERICLES	Lord governor, for so we hear you are,	999
	Let not our ships and number of our men	999
	Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.	999
	We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,	999
	And seen the desolation of your streets:	999
	Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,	999
	But to relieve them of their heavy load;	999
	And these our ships, you happily may think	999
	Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within	999
	With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,	999
	Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,	999
	And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.	999
	999
All	The gods of Greece protect you!	999
	And we'll pray for you.	999
	999
PERICLES	Arise, I pray you, rise:	999
	We do not look for reverence, but to love,	999
	And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men.	999
	999
CLEON	The which when any shall not gratify,	999
	Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,	999
	Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,	999
	The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!	999
	Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--	999
	Your grace is welcome to our town and us.	999
	999

	999
	Good Helicane, that stay'd at home,	999

	Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,	999

	[Enter three FISHERMEN]	999
	999
First Fisherman	What, ho, Pilch!	999
	999
Second Fisherman	Ha, come and bring away the nets!	999
	999
First Fisherman	What, Patch-breech, I say!	999
	999
Third Fisherman	What say you, master?	999
	999
First Fisherman	Look how thou stirrest now! come away, or I'll	999
	fetch thee with a wanion.	999
	999
Third Fisherman	Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that	999
	were cast away before us even now.	999
	999
First Fisherman	Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what	999
	pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,	999
	well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.	999
	999
Third Fisherman	Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the	999
	porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say	999
	they're half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,	999
	they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master, I	999
	marvel how the fishes live in the sea.	999
	999
First Fisherman	Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the	999
	little ones: I can compare our rich misers to	999
	nothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays and	999
	tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at	999
	last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales	999
	have I heard on o' the land, who never leave gaping	999
	till they've swallowed the whole parish, church,	999
	steeple, bells, and all.	999
	999
PERICLES	[Aside]  A pretty moral.	999
	999
Third Fisherman	But, master, if I had been the sexton, I would have	999
	been that day in the belfry.	999
	999
Second Fisherman	Why, man?	999
	999
Third Fisherman	Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I	999
	had been in his belly, I would have kept such a	999
	jangling of the bells, that he should never have	999
	left, till he cast bells, steeple, church, and	999
	parish up again. But if the good King Simonides	999
	were of my mind,--	999
	999
PERICLES	[Aside]  Simonides!	999
	999
Third Fisherman	We would purge the land of these drones, that rob	999
	the bee of her honey.	999
	999
PERICLES	[Aside]  How from the finny subject of the sea	999
	These fishers tell the infirmities of men;	999
	And from their watery empire recollect	999
	All that may men approve or men detect!	999
	Peace be at your labour, honest fishermen.	999
	999
Second Fisherman	Honest! good fellow, what's that? If it be a day	999
	fits you, search out of the calendar, and nobody	999
	look after it.	999
	999
PERICLES	May see the sea hath cast upon your coast.	999
	999
Second Fisherman	What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our	999
	way!	999
	999
PERICLES	A man whom both the waters and the wind,	999
	In that vast tennis-court, have made the ball	999
	For them to play upon, entreats you pity him:	999
	He asks of you, that never used to beg.	999
	999
First Fisherman	No, friend, cannot you beg? Here's them in our	999
	country Greece gets more with begging than we can do	999
	with working.	999
	999
Second Fisherman	Canst thou catch any fishes, then?	999
	999
PERICLES	I never practised it.	999
	999
Second Fisherman	Nay, then thou wilt starve, sure; for here's nothing	999
	to be got now-a-days, unless thou canst fish for't.	999
	999
PERICLES	What I have been I have forgot to know;	999
	But what I am, want teaches me to think on:	999
	A man throng'd up with cold: my veins are chill,	999
	And have no more of life than may suffice	999
	To give my tongue that heat to ask your help;	999
	Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,	999
	For that I am a man, pray see me buried.	999
	999
First Fisherman	Die quoth-a? Now gods forbid! I have a gown here;	999
	come, put it on; keep thee warm. Now, afore me, a	999
	handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, and	999
	we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for	999
	fasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks,	999
	and thou shalt be welcome.	999
	999
PERICLES	I thank you, sir.	999
	999
Second Fisherman	Hark you, my friend; you said you could not beg.	999
	999
PERICLES	I did but crave.	999
	999
Second Fisherman	But crave! Then I'll turn craver too, and so I	999
	shall 'scape whipping.	999
	999
PERICLES	Why, are all your beggars whipped, then?	999
	999
Second Fisherman	O, not all, my friend, not all; for if all your	999
	beggars were whipped, I would wish no better office	999
	than to be beadle. But, master, I'll go draw up the	999
	net.	999
	999
	[Exit with Third Fisherman]	999

PERICLES	[Aside]  How well this honest mirth becomes their labour!	999
	999
First Fisherman	Hark you, sir, do you know where ye are?	999
	999
PERICLES	Not well.	999
	999
First Fisherman	Why, I'll tell you: this is called Pentapolis, and	999
	our king the good Simonides.	999
	999
PERICLES	The good King Simonides, do you call him.	999
	999
First Fisherman	Ay, sir; and he deserves so to be called for his	999
	peaceable reign and good government.	999
	999
PERICLES	He is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects	999
	the name of good by his government. How far is his	999
	court distant from this shore?	999
	999
First Fisherman	Marry, sir, half a day's journey: and I'll tell	999
	you, he hath a fair daughter, and to-morrow is her	999
	birth-day; and there are princes and knights come	999
	from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love.	999
	999
PERICLES	Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wish	999
	to make one there.	999
	999
First Fisherman	O, sir, things must be as they may; and what a man	999
	cannot get, he may lawfully deal for--his wife's soul.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Second and Third Fishermen, drawing up a net]	999
	999
Second Fisherman	Help, master, help! here's a fish hangs in the net,	999
	like a poor man's right in the law; 'twill hardly	999
	come out. Ha! bots on't, 'tis come at last, and	999
	'tis turned to a rusty armour.	999
	999
PERICLES	An armour, friends! I pray you, let me see it.	999
	Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses,	999
	Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;	999
	And though it was mine own, part of my heritage,	999
	Which my dead father did bequeath to me.	999
	With this strict charge, even as he left his life,	999
	'Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield	999
	Twixt me and death;'--and pointed to this brace;--	999
	'For that it saved me, keep it; in like necessity--	999
	The which the gods protect thee from!--may	999
	defend thee.'	999
	It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it;	999
	Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,	999
	Took it in rage, though calm'd have given't again:	999
	I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill,	999
	Since I have here my father's gift in's will.	999
	999
First Fisherman	What mean you, sir?	999
	999
PERICLES	To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,	999
	For it was sometime target to a king;	999
	I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,	999
	And for his sake I wish the having of it;	999
	And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court,	999
	Where with it I may appear a gentleman;	999
	And if that ever my low fortune's better,	999
	I'll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.	999
	999
First Fisherman	Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?	999
	999
PERICLES	I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.	999
	999
First Fisherman	Why, do 'e take it, and the gods give thee good on't!	999
	999
Second Fisherman	Ay, but hark you, my friend; 'twas we that made up	999
	this garment through the rough seams of the waters:	999
	there are certain condolements, certain vails. I	999
	hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from	999
	whence you had it.	999
	999
PERICLES	Believe 't, I will.	999
	By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;	999
	And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,	999
	This jewel holds his building on my arm:	999
	Unto thy value I will mount myself	999
	Upon a courser, whose delightful steps	999
	Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.	999
	Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided	999
	Of a pair of bases.	999
	999
Second Fisherman	We'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to	999
	make thee a pair; and I'll bring thee to the court myself.	999
	999
PERICLES	Then honour be but a goal to my will,	999
	This day I'll rise, or else add ill to ill.	999

ACT II	999

	999
	999
SCENE II	The same. A public way or platform leading to the	999
	lists. A pavilion by the side of it for the	999
	reception of King, Princess, Lords, &c.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, and Attendants]	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Are the knights ready to begin the triumph?	999
	999
First Lord	They are, my liege;	999
	And stay your coming to present themselves.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Return them, we are ready; and our daughter,	999
	In honour of whose birth these triumphs are,	999
	Sits here, like beauty's child, whom nature gat	999
	For men to see, and seeing wonder at.	999
	999
	[Exit a Lord]	999
	999
THAISA	It pleaseth you, my royal father, to express	999
	My commendations great, whose merit's less.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	It's fit it should be so; for princes are	999
	A model which heaven makes like to itself:	999
	As jewels lose their glory if neglected,	999
	So princes their renowns if not respected.	999
	'Tis now your honour, daughter, to explain	999
	The labour of each knight in his device.	999
	999
THAISA	Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.	999
	999
	[Enter a Knight; he passes over, and his Squire	999
	presents his shield to the Princess]	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Who is the first that doth prefer himself?	999
	999
THAISA	A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;	999
	And the device he bears upon his shield	999
	Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun	999
	The word, 'Lux tua vita mihi.'	999
	999
SIMONIDES	He loves you well that holds his life of you.	999
	999
	[The Second Knight passes over]	999
	999
	Who is the second that presents himself?	999
	999
THAISA	A prince of Macedon, my royal father;	999
	And the device he bears upon his shield	999
	Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;	999
	The motto thus, in Spanish, 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'	999
	999
	[The Third Knight passes over]	999
	999
SIMONIDES	And what's the third?	999
	999
THAISA	The third of Antioch;	999
	And his device, a wreath of chivalry;	999
	The word, 'Me pompae provexit apex.'	999
	999
	[The Fourth Knight passes over]	999
	999
SIMONIDES	What is the fourth?	999
	999
THAISA	A burning torch that's turned upside down;	999
	The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.'	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,	999
	Which can as well inflame as it can kill.	999
	999
	[The Fifth Knight passes over]	999
	999
THAISA	The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,	999
	Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;	999
	The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'	999
	999
	[The Sixth Knight, PERICLES, passes over]	999
	999
SIMONIDES	And what's	999
	The sixth and last, the which the knight himself	999
	With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?	999
	999
THAISA	He seems to be a stranger; but his present is	999
	A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;	999
	The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.'	999
	999
SIMONIDES	A pretty moral;	999
	From the dejected state wherein he is,	999
	He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.	999
	999
First Lord	He had need mean better than his outward show	999
	Can any way speak in his just commend;	999
	For by his rusty outside he appears	999
	To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.	999
	999
Second Lord	He well may be a stranger, for he comes	999
	To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.	999
	999
Third Lord	And on set purpose let his armour rust	999
	Until this day, to scour it in the dust.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan	999
	The outward habit by the inward man.	999
	But stay, the knights are coming: we will withdraw	999
	Into the gallery.	999

SCENE III	The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, Attendants, and	999
	Knights, from tilting]	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Knights,	999
	To say you're welcome were superfluous.	999
	To place upon the volume of your deeds,	999
	As in a title-page, your worth in arms,	999
	Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,	999
	Since every worth in show commends itself.	999
	Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:	999
	You are princes and my guests.	999
	999
THAISA	But you, my knight and guest;	999
	To whom this wreath of victory I give,	999
	And crown you king of this day's happiness.	999
	999
PERICLES	'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Call it by what you will, the day is yours;	999
	And here, I hope, is none that envies it.	999
	In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,	999
	To make some good, but others to exceed;	999
	And you are her labour'd scholar. Come, queen o'	999
	the feast,--	999
	For, daughter, so you are,--here take your place:	999
	Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.	999
	999
KNIGHTS	We are honour'd much by good Simonides.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Your presence glads our days: honour we love;	999
	For who hates honour hates the gods above.	999
	999
Marshal	Sir, yonder is your place.	999
	999
PERICLES	Some other is more fit.	999
	999
First Knight	Contend not, sir; for we are gentlemen	999
	That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes	999
	Envy the great nor do the low despise.	999
	999
PERICLES	You are right courteous knights.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Sit, sir, sit.	999
	999
PERICLES	By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,	999
	These cates resist me, she but thought upon.	999
	999
THAISA	By Juno, that is queen of marriage,	999
	All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.	999
	Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	He's but a country gentleman;	999
	Has done no more than other knights have done;	999
	Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.	999
	999
THAISA	To me he seems like diamond to glass.	999
	999
PERICLES	Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,	999
	Which tells me in that glory once he was;	999
	Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,	999
	And he the sun, for them to reverence;	999
	None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,	999
	Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:	999
	Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,	999
	The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:	999
	Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,	999
	He's both their parent, and he is their grave,	999
	And gives them what he will, not what they crave.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	What, are you merry, knights?	999
	999
Knights	Who can be other in this royal presence?	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--	999
	As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--	999
	We drink this health to you.	999
	999
KNIGHTS	We thank your grace.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Yet pause awhile:	999
	Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,	999
	As if the entertainment in our court	999
	Had not a show might countervail his worth.	999
	Note it not you, Thaisa?	999
	999
THAISA	What is it	999
	To me, my father?	999
	999
SIMONIDES	                  O, attend, my daughter:	999
	Princes in this should live like gods above,	999
	Who freely give to every one that comes	999
	To honour them:	999
	And princes not doing so are like to gnats,	999
	Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.	999
	Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,	999
	Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.	999
	999
THAISA	Alas, my father, it befits not me	999
	Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:	999
	He may my proffer take for an offence,	999
	Since men take women's gifts for impudence.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	How!	999
	Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.	999
	999
THAISA	[Aside]  Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,	999
	Of whence he is, his name and parentage.	999
	999
THAISA	The king my father, sir, has drunk to you.	999
	999
PERICLES	I thank him.	999
	999
THAISA	Wishing it so much blood unto your life.	999
	999
PERICLES	I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.	999
	999
THAISA	And further he desires to know of you,	999
	Of whence you are, your name and parentage.	999
	999
PERICLES	A gentleman of Tyre; my name, Pericles;	999
	My education been in arts and arms;	999
	Who, looking for adventures in the world,	999
	Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,	999
	And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.	999
	999
THAISA	He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,	999
	A gentleman of Tyre,	999
	Who only by misfortune of the seas	999
	Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,	999
	And will awake him from his melancholy.	999
	Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,	999
	And waste the time, which looks for other revels.	999
	Even in your armours, as you are address'd,	999
	Will very well become a soldier's dance.	999
	I will not have excuse, with saying this	999
	Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,	999
	Since they love men in arms as well as beds.	999
	999
	[The Knights dance]	999
	999
	So, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd.	999
	Come, sir;	999
	Here is a lady that wants breathing too:	999
	And I have heard, you knights of Tyre	999
	Are excellent in making ladies trip;	999
	And that their measures are as excellent.	999
	999
PERICLES	In those that practise them they are, my lord.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	O, that's as much as you would be denied	999
	Of your fair courtesy.	999
	999
	[The Knights and Ladies dance]	999
	999
		 Unclasp, unclasp:	999
	Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well.	999
	999
	[To PERICLES]	999
	999
	But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct	999
	These knights unto their several lodgings!	999
	999
	[To PERICLES]	999
	999
			 Yours, sir,	999
	We have given order to be next our own.	999
	999
PERICLES	I am at your grace's pleasure.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Princes, it is too late to talk of love;	999
	And that's the mark I know you level at:	999
	Therefore each one betake him to his rest;	999
	To-morrow all for speeding do their best.	999

	999
	[Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES]	999
	999
HELICANUS	No, Escanes, know this of me,	999
	Antiochus from incest lived not free:	999
	For which, the most high gods not minding longer	999
	To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,	999
	Due to this heinous capital offence,	999
	Even in the height and pride of all his glory,	999
	When he was seated in a chariot	999
	Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,	999
	A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up	999
	Their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk,	999
	That all those eyes adored them ere their fall	999
	Scorn now their hand should give them burial.	999
	999
ESCANES	'Twas very strange.	999
	999
HELICANUS	And yet but justice; for though	999
	This king were great, his greatness was no guard	999
	To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward.	999
	999
ESCANES	'Tis very true.	999
	999
	[Enter two or three Lords]	999
	999
First Lord	See, not a man in private conference	999
	Or council has respect with him but he.	999
	999
Second Lord	It shall no longer grieve without reproof.	999
	999
Third Lord	And cursed be he that will not second it.	999
	999
First Lord	Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.	999
	999
HELICANUS	With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords.	999
	999
First Lord	Know that our griefs are risen to the top,	999
	And now at length they overflow their banks.	999
	999
HELICANUS	Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.	999
	999
First Lord	Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane;	999
	But if the prince do live, let us salute him,	999
	Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.	999
	If in the world he live, we'll seek him out;	999
	If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there;	999
	And be resolved he lives to govern us,	999
	Or dead, give's cause to mourn his funeral,	999
	And leave us to our free election.	999
	999
Second Lord	Whose death indeed's the strongest in our censure:	999
	And knowing this kingdom is without a head,--	999
	Like goodly buildings left without a roof	999
	Soon fall to ruin,--your noble self,	999
	That best know how to rule and how to reign,	999
	We thus submit unto,--our sovereign.	999
	999
All	Live, noble Helicane!	999
	999
HELICANUS	For honour's cause, forbear your suffrages:	999
	If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.	999
	Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,	999
	Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.	999
	A twelvemonth longer, let me entreat you to	999
	Forbear the absence of your king:	999
	If in which time expired, he not return,	999
	I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.	999
	But if I cannot win you to this love,	999
	Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,	999
	And in your search spend your adventurous worth;	999
	Whom if you find, and win unto return,	999
	You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.	999
	999
First Lord	To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield;	999
	And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,	999
	We with our travels will endeavour us.	999
	999
HELICANUS	Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:	999
	When peers thus knit, a kingdom ever stands.	999

	999
First Knight	Good morrow to the good Simonides.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,	999
	That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake	999
	A married life.	999
	Her reason to herself is only known,	999
	Which yet from her by no means can I get.	999
	999
Second Knight	May we not get access to her, my lord?	999
	999
SIMONIDES	'Faith, by no means; she has so strictly tied	999
	Her to her chamber, that 'tis impossible.	999
	One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery;	999
	This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd	999
	And on her virgin honour will not break it.	999
	999
Third Knight	Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Knights]	999
	999
SIMONIDES	So,	999
	They are well dispatch'd; now to my daughter's letter:	999
	She tells me here, she'd wed the stranger knight,	999
	Or never more to view nor day nor light.	999
	'Tis well, mistress; your choice agrees with mine;	999
	I like that well: nay, how absolute she's in't,	999
	Not minding whether I dislike or no!	999
	Well, I do commend her choice;	999
	And will no longer have it be delay'd.	999
	Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.	999
	999
	[Enter PERICLES]	999
	999
PERICLES	All fortune to the good Simonides!	999
	999
SIMONIDES	To you as much, sir! I am beholding to you	999
	For your sweet music this last night: I do	999
	Protest my ears were never better fed	999
	With such delightful pleasing harmony.	999
	999
PERICLES	It is your grace's pleasure to commend;	999
	Not my desert.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Sir, you are music's master.	999
	999
PERICLES	The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Let me ask you one thing:	999
	What do you think of my daughter, sir?	999
	999
PERICLES	A most virtuous princess.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	And she is fair too, is she not?	999
	999
PERICLES	As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you;	999
	Ay, so well, that you must be her master,	999
	And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it.	999
	999
PERICLES	I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.	999
	999
PERICLES	[Aside]  What's here?	999
	A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!	999
	'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.	999
	O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,	999
	A stranger and distressed gentleman,	999
	That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,	999
	But bent all offices to honour her.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art	999
	A villain.	999
	999
PERICLES	By the gods, I have not:	999
	Never did thought of mine levy offence;	999
	Nor never did my actions yet commence	999
	A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Traitor, thou liest.	999
	999
PERICLES	Traitor!	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Ay, traitor.	999
	999
PERICLES	Even in his throat--unless it be the king--	999
	That calls me traitor, I return the lie.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	[Aside]  Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.	999
	999
PERICLES	My actions are as noble as my thoughts,	999
	That never relish'd of a base descent.	999
	I came unto your court for honour's cause,	999
	And not to be a rebel to her state;	999
	And he that otherwise accounts of me,	999
	This sword shall prove he's honour's enemy.	999
	999
SIMONIDES	No?	999
	Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.	999
	999
	[Enter THAISA]	999
	999
PERICLES	Then, as you are as virtuous as fair,	999
	Resolve your angry father, if my tongue	999
	Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe	999
	To any syllable that made love to you.	999
	999
THAISA	Why, sir, say if you had,	999
	Who takes offence at that would make me glad?	999
	999
SIMONIDES	Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	I am glad on't with all my heart.--	999
	I'll tame you; I'll bring you in subjection.	999
	Will you, not having my consent,	999
	Bestow your love and your affections	999
	Upon a stranger?	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	who, for aught I know,	999
	May be, nor can I think the contrary,	999
	As great in blood as I myself.--	999
	Therefore hear you, mistress; either frame	999
	Your will to mine,--and you, sir, hear you,	999
	Either be ruled by me, or I will make you--	999
	Man and wife:	999
	Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too:	999
	And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy;	999
	And for a further grief,--God give you joy!--	999
	What, are you both pleased?	999
	999
THAISA	Yes, if you love me, sir.	999
	999
PERICLES	Even as my life, or blood that fosters it.	999
	999

	999
GOWER	Now sleep y-slaked hath the rout;	999
	No din but snores the house about,	999
	Made louder by the o'er-fed breast	999
	Of this most pompous marriage-feast.	999
	The cat, with eyne of burning coal,	999
	Now crouches fore the mouse's hole;	999
	And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,	999
	E'er the blither for their drouth.	999
	Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.	999
	Where, by the loss of maidenhead,	999
	A babe is moulded. Be attent,	999
	And time that is so briefly spent	999
	With your fine fancies quaintly eche:	999
	What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.	999
	999

	999
	[Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door, with	999
	Attendants; a Messenger meets them, kneels, and	999
	gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES shows it	999
	SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter	999
	THAISA with child, with LYCHORIDA a nurse. The	999
	KING shows her the letter; she rejoices: she and	999
	PERICLES takes leave of her father, and depart with	999
	LYCHORIDA and their Attendants. Then exeunt	999
	SIMONIDES and the rest]	999
	999
	By many a dern and painful perch	999
	Of Pericles the careful search,	999
	By the four opposing coigns	999
	Which the world together joins,	999
	Is made with all due diligence	999
	That horse and sail and high expense	999
	Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,	999
	Fame answering the most strange inquire,	999
	To the court of King Simonides	999
	Are letters brought, the tenor these:	999
	Antiochus and his daughter dead;	999
	The men of Tyrus on the head	999
	Of Helicanus would set on	999
	The crown of Tyre, but he will none:	999
	The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;	999
	Says to 'em, if King Pericles	999
	Come not home in twice six moons,	999
	He, obedient to their dooms,	999
	Will take the crown. The sum of this,	999
	Brought hither to Pentapolis,	999
	Y-ravished the regions round,	999
	And every one with claps can sound,	999
	'Our heir-apparent is a king!	999
	Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'	999
	Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:	999
	His queen with child makes her desire--	999
	Which who shall cross?--along to go:	999
	Omit we all their dole and woe:	999
	Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,	999
	And so to sea. Their vessel shakes	999
	On Neptune's billow; half the flood	999
	Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood	999
	Varies again; the grisly north	999
	Disgorges such a tempest forth,	999
	That, as a duck for life that dives,	999
	So up and down the poor ship drives:	999
	The lady shrieks, and well-a-near	999
	Does fall in travail with her fear:	999
	And what ensues in this fell storm	999
	Shall for itself itself perform.	999

	999
PERICLES	Thou god of this great vast, rebuke these surges,	999
	Which wash both heaven and hell; and thou, that hast	999
	Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,	999
	Having call'd them from the deep! O, still	999
	Thy deafening, dreadful thunders; gently quench	999
	Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes! O, how, Lychorida,	999
	How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously;	999
	Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman's whistle	999
	Is as a whisper in the ears of death,	999
	Unheard. Lychorida!--Lucina, O	999
	Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle	999
	To those that cry by night, convey thy deity	999
	Aboard our dancing boat; make swift the pangs	999
	Of my queen's travails!	999
	999
	[Enter LYCHORIDA, with an Infant]	999
	999
		  Now, Lychorida!	999
	999
LYCHORIDA	Here is a thing too young for such a place,	999
	Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I	999
	Am like to do: take in your arms this piece	999
	Of your dead queen.	999
	999
PERICLES	How, how, Lychorida!	999
	999
LYCHORIDA	Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm.	999
	Here's all that is left living of your queen,	999
	A little daughter: for the sake of it,	999
	Be manly, and take comfort.	999
	999
PERICLES	O you gods!	999
	Why do you make us love your goodly gifts,	999
	And snatch them straight away? We here below	999
	Recall not what we give, and therein may	999
	Use honour with you.	999
	999
LYCHORIDA	Patience, good sir,	999
	Even for this charge.	999
	999
PERICLES	Now, mild may be thy life!	999
	For a more blustrous birth had never babe:	999
	Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for	999
	Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world	999
	That ever was prince's child. Happy what follows!	999
	Thou hast as chiding a nativity	999
	As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,	999
	To herald thee from the womb: even at the first	999
	Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit,	999
	With all thou canst find here. Now, the good gods	999
	Throw their best eyes upon't!	999
	999
	[Enter two Sailors]	999
	999
First Sailor	What courage, sir? God save you!	999
	999
PERICLES	Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;	999
	It hath done to me the worst. Yet, for the love	999
	Of this poor infant, this fresh-new sea-farer,	999
	I would it would be quiet.	999
	999
First Sailor	Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou?	999
	Blow, and split thyself.	999
	999
Second Sailor	But sea-room, an the brine and cloudy billow kiss	999
	the moon, I care not.	999
	999
First Sailor	Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high,	999
	the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be	999
	cleared of the dead.	999
	999
PERICLES	That's your superstition.	999
	999
First Sailor	Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been still	999
	observed: and we are strong in custom. Therefore	999
	briefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.	999
	999
PERICLES	As you think meet. Most wretched queen!	999
	999
LYCHORIDA	Here she lies, sir.	999
	999
PERICLES	A terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear;	999
	No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements	999
	Forgot thee utterly: nor have I time	999
	To give thee hallow'd to thy grave, but straight	999
	Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;	999
	Where, for a monument upon thy bones,	999
	And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whale	999
	And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,	999
	Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,	999
	Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,	999
	My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander	999
	Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe	999
	Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say	999
	A priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.	999
	999
	[Exit LYCHORIDA]	999
	999
Second Sailor	Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulked	999
	and bitumed ready.	999
	999
PERICLES	I thank thee. Mariner, say what coast is this?	999
	999
Second Sailor	We are near Tarsus.	999
	999
PERICLES	Thither, gentle mariner.	999
	Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?	999
	999
Second Sailor	By break of day, if the wind cease.	999
	999
PERICLES	O, make for Tarsus!	999
	There will I visit Cleon, for the babe	999
	Cannot hold out to Tyrus: there I'll leave it	999

	999
Servant	I have been in many; but such a night as this,	999
	Till now, I ne'er endured.	999

	999
First Gentleman	Good morrow.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Good morrow to your lordship.	999
	999
CERIMON	Gentlemen,	999
	Why do you stir so early?	999
	999
First Gentleman	Sir,	999
	Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,	999
	Shook as the earth did quake;	999
	The very principals did seem to rend,	999
	And all-to topple: pure surprise and fear	999
	Made me to quit the house.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	That is the cause we trouble you so early;	999
	'Tis not our husbandry.	999
	999
CERIMON	O, you say well.	999
	999
First Gentleman	But I much marvel that your lordship, having	999
	Rich tire about you, should at these early hours	999
	Shake off the golden slumber of repose.	999
	'Tis most strange,	999
	Nature should be so conversant with pain,	999
	Being thereto not compell'd.	999
	999
CERIMON	I hold it ever,	999
	Virtue and cunning were endowments greater	999
	Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs	999
	May the two latter darken and expend;	999
	But immortality attends the former.	999
	Making a man a god. 'Tis known, I ever	999
	Have studied physic, through which secret art,	999
	By turning o'er authorities, I have,	999
	Together with my practise, made familiar	999
	To me and to my aid the blest infusions	999
	That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;	999
	And I can speak of the disturbances	999
	That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me	999
	A more content in course of true delight	999
	Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,	999
	Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,	999
	To please the fool and death.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth	999
	Your charity, and hundreds call themselves	999
	Your creatures, who by you have been restored:	999
	And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even	999
	Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon	999
	Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.	999
	999
	[Enter two or three Servants with a chest]	999
	999
First Servant	So; lift there.	999
	999
CERIMON	                  What is that?	999
	999
First Servant	Sir, even now	999
	Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest:	999
	'Tis of some wreck.	999
	999
CERIMON	Set 't down, let's look upon't.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	'Tis like a coffin, sir.	999
	999
CERIMON	Whate'er it be,	999
	'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight:	999
	If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,	999
	'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	'Tis so, my lord.	999
	999
CERIMON	                  How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!	999
	Did the sea cast it up?	999
	999
First Servant	I never saw so huge a billow, sir,	999
	As toss'd it upon shore.	999
	999
CERIMON	Wrench it open;	999
	Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	A delicate odour.	999
	999
CERIMON	As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.	999
	O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!	999
	999
First Gentleman	Most strange!	999
	999
CERIMON	Shrouded in cloth of state; balm'd and entreasured	999
	With full bags of spices! A passport too!	999
	Apollo, perfect me in the characters!	999
	999
	[Reads from a scroll]	999
	999
	'Here I give to understand,	999
	If e'er this coffin drive a-land,	999
	I, King Pericles, have lost	999
	This queen, worth all our mundane cost.	999
	Who finds her, give her burying;	999
	She was the daughter of a king:	999
	Besides this treasure for a fee,	999
	The gods requite his charity!'	999
	999
	If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart	999

	999
Second Gentleman	Most likely, sir.	999
	999
CERIMON	                  Nay, certainly to-night;	999
	For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough	999
	That threw her in the sea. Make a fire within:	999
	Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.	999
	999
	[Exit a Servant]	999
	999
	Death may usurp on nature many hours,	999
	And yet the fire of life kindle again	999

	Well said, well said; the fire and cloths.	999
	The rough and woeful music that we have,	999
	Cause it to sound, beseech you.	999
	The viol once more: how thou stirr'st, thou block!	999
	The music there!--I pray you, give her air.	999
	Gentlemen.	999
	This queen will live: nature awakes; a warmth	999
	Breathes out of her: she hath not been entranced	999
	Above five hours: see how she gins to blow	999
	Into life's flower again!	999
	999
First Gentleman	The heavens,	999
	Through you, increase our wonder and set up	999
	Your fame forever.	999
	999

	Her eyelids, cases to those heavenly jewels	999
	Which Pericles hath lost,	999
	Begin to part their fringes of bright gold;	999
	The diamonds of a most praised water	999

First Gentleman	Most rare.	999

PERICLES	We cannot but obey	999

CLEON	Fear not, my lord, but think	999
	Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,	999
	For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,	999
	Must in your child be thought on. If neglection	999
	Should therein make me vile, the common body,	999

	Unscissor'd shall this hair of mine remain,	999

	Whom our fast-growing scene must find	999
	At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd	999
	In music, letters; who hath gain'd	999
	Of education all the grace,	999
	Which makes her both the heart and place	999
	Of general wonder. But, alack,	999
	That monster envy, oft the wrack	999
	Of earned praise, Marina's life	999
	Seeks to take off by treason's knife.	999
	And in this kind hath our Cleon	999
	One daughter, and a wench full grown,	999
	Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid	999
	Hight Philoten: and it is said	999
	For certain in our story, she	999
	Would ever with Marina be:	999
	Be't when she weaved the sleided silk	999
	With fingers long, small, white as milk;	999
	Or when she would with sharp needle wound	999
	The cambric, which she made more sound	999
	By hurting it; or when to the lute	999
	She sung, and made the night-bird mute,	999
	That still records with moan; or when	999
	She would with rich and constant pen	999
	Vail to her mistress Dian; still	999
	This Philoten contends in skill	999
	With absolute Marina: so	999
	With the dove of Paphos might the crow	999
	Vie feathers white. Marina gets	999
	All praises, which are paid as debts,	999
	And not as given. This so darks	999
	In Philoten all graceful marks,	999
	That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,	999
	A present murderer does prepare	999
	For good Marina, that her daughter	999
	Might stand peerless by this slaughter.	999
	The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,	999
	Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:	999
	And cursed Dionyza hath	999
	The pregnant instrument of wrath	999
	Prest for this blow. The unborn event	999
	I do commend to your content:	999
	Only I carry winged time	999
	Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;	999
	Which never could I so convey,	999
	Unless your thoughts went on my way.	999
	Dionyza does appear,	999
	With Leonine, a murderer.	999

	999
SCENE I	Tarsus. An open place near the sea-shore.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DIONYZA and LEONINE]	999
	999
DIONYZA	Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:	999
	'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.	999
	Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,	999
	To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,	999
	Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,	999
	Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which	999
	Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be	999
	A soldier to thy purpose.	999
	999
LEONINE	I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.	999
	999
DIONYZA	The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here	999
	she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.	999
	Thou art resolved?	999
	999
LEONINE	I am resolved.	999
	999
	[Enter MARINA, with a basket of flowers]	999
	999
MARINA	No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,	999
	To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,	999
	The purple violets, and marigolds,	999
	Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,	999
	While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,	999
	Born in a tempest, when my mother died,	999
	This world to me is like a lasting storm,	999
	Whirring me from my friends.	999
	999
DIONYZA	How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?	999
	How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not	999
	Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have	999
	A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed	999
	With this unprofitable woe!	999
	Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.	999
	Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,	999
	And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,	999
	Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.	999
	999
MARINA	No, I pray you;	999
	I'll not bereave you of your servant.	999
	999
DIONYZA	Come, come;	999
	I love the king your father, and yourself,	999
	With more than foreign heart. We every day	999
	Expect him here: when he shall come and find	999
	Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,	999
	He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;	999
	Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken	999
	No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,	999
	Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve	999
	That excellent complexion, which did steal	999
	The eyes of young and old. Care not for me	999
	I can go home alone.	999
	999
MARINA	Well, I will go;	999
	But yet I have no desire to it.	999
	999
DIONYZA	Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.	999
	Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:	999
	Remember what I have said.	999
	999
LEONINE	I warrant you, madam.	999
	999
DIONYZA	I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:	999
	Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:	999
	What! I must have a care of you.	999
	999
MARINA	My thanks, sweet madam.	999
	999
	[Exit DIONYZA]	999
	999
	Is this wind westerly that blows?	999
	999
LEONINE	South-west.	999
	999
MARINA	When I was born, the wind was north.	999
	999
LEONINE	Was't so?	999
	999
MARINA	My father, as nurse said, did never fear,	999
	But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors, galling	999
	His kingly hands, haling ropes;	999
	And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea	999
	That almost burst the deck.	999
	999
LEONINE	When was this?	999
	999
MARINA	When I was born:	999
	Never was waves nor wind more violent;	999
	And from the ladder-tackle washes off	999
	A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'	999
	And with a dropping industry they skip	999
	From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and	999
	The master calls, and trebles their confusion.	999
	999
LEONINE	Come, say your prayers.	999
	999
MARINA	What mean you?	999
	999
LEONINE	If you require a little space for prayer,	999
	I grant it: pray; but be not tedious,	999
	For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn	999
	To do my work with haste.	999
	999
MARINA	Why will you kill me?	999
	999
LEONINE	To satisfy my lady.	999
	999
MARINA	Why would she have me kill'd?	999
	Now, as I can remember, by my troth,	999
	I never did her hurt in all my life:	999
	I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn	999
	To any living creature: believe me, la,	999
	I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:	999
	I trod upon a worm against my will,	999
	But I wept for it. How have I offended,	999
	Wherein my death might yield her any profit,	999
	Or my life imply her any danger?	999
	999
LEONINE	My commission	999
	Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.	999
	999
MARINA	You will not do't for all the world, I hope.	999
	You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow	999
	You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,	999
	When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:	999
	Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:	999
	Your lady seeks my life; come you between,	999
	And save poor me, the weaker.	999
	999
LEONINE	I am sworn,	999
	And will dispatch.	999
	999
	[He seizes her]	999
	999
	[Enter Pirates]	999
	999
First Pirate	Hold, villain!	999
	999
	[LEONINE runs away]	999
	999
Second Pirate	A prize! a prize!	999
	999
Third Pirate	Half-part, mates, half-part.	999
	Come, let's have her aboard suddenly.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Pirates with MARINA]	999
	999
	[Re-enter LEONINE]	999
	999
LEONINE	These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;	999
	And they have seized Marina. Let her go:	999
	There's no hope she will return. I'll swear	999
	she's dead,	999
	And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:	999
	Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,	999
	Not carry her aboard. If she remain,	999
	Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.	999

SCENE II	Mytilene. A room in a brothel.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT]	999
	999
Pandar	Boult!	999
	999
BOULT	Sir?	999
	999
Pandar	Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of	999
	gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being	999
	too wenchless.	999
	999
Bawd	We were never so much out of creatures. We have but	999
	poor three, and they can do no more than they can	999
	do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.	999
	999
Pandar	Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for	999
	them. If there be not a conscience to be used in	999
	every trade, we shall never prosper.	999
	999
Bawd	Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor	999
	bastards,--as, I think, I have brought up some eleven--	999
	999
BOULT	Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But	999
	shall I search the market?	999
	999
Bawd	What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind	999
	will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.	999
	999
Pandar	Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o'	999
	conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that	999
	lay with the little baggage.	999
	999
BOULT	Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat	999
	for worms. But I'll go search the market.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
Pandar	Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a	999
	proportion to live quietly, and so give over.	999
	999
Bawd	Why to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get	999
	when we are old?	999
	999
Pandar	O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor	999
	the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore,	999
	if in our youths we could pick up some pretty	999
	estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched.	999
	Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods	999
	will be strong with us for giving over.	999
	999
Bawd	Come, other sorts offend as well as we.	999
	999
Pandar	As well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse.	999
	Neither is our profession any trade; it's no	999
	calling. But here comes Boult.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BOULT, with the Pirates and MARINA]	999
	999
BOULT	[To MARINA]  Come your ways. My masters, you say	999
	she's a virgin?	999
	999
First Pirate	O, sir, we doubt it not.	999
	999
BOULT	Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see:	999
	if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.	999
	999
Bawd	Boult, has she any qualities?	999
	999
BOULT	She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent	999
	good clothes: there's no further necessity of	999
	qualities can make her be refused.	999
	999
Bawd	What's her price, Boult?	999
	999
BOULT	I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.	999
	999
Pandar	Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your	999
	money presently. Wife, take her in; instruct her	999
	what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her	999
	entertainment.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Pandar and Pirates]	999
	999
Bawd	Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her	999
	hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her	999
	virginity; and cry 'He that will give most shall	999
	have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap	999
	thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done	999
	as I command you.	999
	999
BOULT	Performance shall follow.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
MARINA	Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!	999
	He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,	999
	Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me	999
	For to seek my mother!	999
	999
Bawd	Why lament you, pretty one?	999
	999
MARINA	That I am pretty.	999
	999
Bawd	Come, the gods have done their part in you.	999
	999
MARINA	I accuse them not.	999
	999
Bawd	You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.	999
	999
MARINA	The more my fault	999
	To scape his hands where I was like to die.	999
	999
Bawd	Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.	999
	999
MARINA	No.	999
	999
Bawd	Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all	999
	fashions: you shall fare well; you shall have the	999
	difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?	999
	999
MARINA	Are you a woman?	999
	999
Bawd	What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?	999
	999
MARINA	An honest woman, or not a woman.	999
	999
Bawd	Marry, whip thee, gosling: I think I shall have	999
	something to do with you. Come, you're a young	999
	foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have	999
	you.	999
	999
MARINA	The gods defend me!	999
	999
Bawd	If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men	999
	must comfort you, men must feed you, men must stir	999
	you up. Boult's returned.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BOULT]	999
	999
	Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?	999
	999
BOULT	I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs;	999
	I have drawn her picture with my voice.	999
	999
Bawd	And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the	999
	inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?	999
	999
BOULT	'Faith, they listened to me as they would have	999
	hearkened to their father's testament. There was a	999
	Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to	999
	her very description.	999
	999
Bawd	We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.	999
	999
BOULT	To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the	999
	French knight that cowers i' the hams?	999
	999
Bawd	Who, Monsieur Veroles?	999
	999
BOULT	Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the	999
	proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore	999
	he would see her to-morrow.	999
	999
Bawd	Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease	999
	hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will	999
	come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the	999
	sun.	999
	999
BOULT	Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we	999
	should lodge them with this sign.	999
	999
Bawd	[To MARINA]  Pray you, come hither awhile. You	999
	have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must	999
	seem to do that fearfully which you commit	999
	willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.	999
	To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your	999
	lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good	999
	opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.	999
	999
MARINA	I understand you not.	999
	999
BOULT	O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these	999
	blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.	999
	999
Bawd	Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must; for your	999
	bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go	999
	with warrant.	999
	999
BOULT	'Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if	999
	I have bargained for the joint,--	999
	999
Bawd	Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.	999
	999
BOULT	I may so.	999
	999
Bawd	Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the	999
	manner of your garments well.	999
	999
BOULT	Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.	999
	999
Bawd	Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a	999
	sojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom.	999
	When nature flamed this piece, she meant thee a good	999
	turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou	999
	hast the harvest out of thine own report.	999
	999
BOULT	I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake	999
	the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up	999
	the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.	999
	999
Bawd	Come your ways; follow me.	999
	999
MARINA	If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,	999
	Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.	999
	Diana, aid my purpose!	999

	999
DIONYZA	Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?	999
	999
CLEON	O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter	999
	The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!	999
	999
DIONYZA	I think	999
	You'll turn a child again.	999
	999
CLEON	Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,	999
	I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,	999
	Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess	999
	To equal any single crown o' the earth	999
	I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!	999
	Whom thou hast poison'd too:	999
	If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness	999
	Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say	999
	When noble Pericles shall demand his child?	999
	999
DIONYZA	That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,	999
	To foster it, nor ever to preserve.	999
	She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?	999
	Unless you play the pious innocent,	999
	And for an honest attribute cry out	999
	'She died by foul play.'	999
	999
CLEON	O, go to. Well, well,	999
	Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods	999
	Do like this worst.	999
	999
DIONYZA	Be one of those that think	999
	The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,	999
	And open this to Pericles. I do shame	999
	To think of what a noble strain you are,	999
	And of how coward a spirit.	999
	999
CLEON	To such proceeding	999
	Who ever but his approbation added,	999
	Though not his prime consent, he did not flow	999
	From honourable sources.	999
	999
DIONYZA	Be it so, then:	999
	Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,	999
	Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.	999
	She did disdain my child, and stood between	999
	Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,	999
	But cast their gazes on Marina's face;	999
	Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin	999
	Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;	999
	And though you call my course unnatural,	999
	You not your child well loving, yet I find	999
	It greets me as an enterprise of kindness	999
	Perform'd to your sole daughter.	999
	999
CLEON	Heavens forgive it!	999
	999
DIONYZA	And as for Pericles,	999
	What should he say? We wept after her hearse,	999
	And yet we mourn: her monument	999
	Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs	999
	In glittering golden characters express	999
	A general praise to her, and care in us	999
	At whose expense 'tis done.	999
	999
CLEON	Thou art like the harpy,	999
	Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,	999
	Seize with thine eagle's talons.	999
	999
DIONYZA	You are like one that superstitiously	999
	Doth swear to the gods that winter kills the flies:	999
	But yet I know you'll do as I advise.	999

	By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime	999
	To use one language in each several clime	999
	Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you	999
	To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,	999
	The stages of our story. Pericles	999
	Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,	999
	Attended on by many a lord and knight.	999
	To see his daughter, all his life's delight.	999
	Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late	999
	Advanced in time to great and high estate,	999
	Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,	999
	Old Helicanus goes along behind.	999
	Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought	999
	This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;	999
	So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--	999
	To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.	999
	Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;	999
	Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.	999
	999
	DUMB SHOW.	999
	999
	[Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train;	999
	CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows	999
	PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes	999
	lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty	999
	passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA]	999
	999
	See how belief may suffer by foul show!	999
	This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;	999
	And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,	999
	With sighs shot through, and biggest tears	999
	o'ershower'd,	999
	Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears	999
	Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:	999
	He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears	999
	A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,	999
	And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.	999
	The epitaph is for Marina writ	999
	By wicked Dionyza.	999
	999
	[Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument]	999
	999
	'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,	999
	Who wither'd in her spring of year.	999
	She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,	999
	On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;	999
	Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,	999
	Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:	999
	Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,	999
	Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:	999
	Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,	999
	Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'	999
	999
	No visor does become black villany	999
	So well as soft and tender flattery.	999
	Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,	999
	And bear his courses to be ordered	999
	By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play	999
	His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day	999
	In her unholy service. Patience, then,	999
	And think you now are all in Mytilene.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter, from the brothel, two Gentlemen]	999
	999
First Gentleman	Did you ever hear the like?	999
	999
Second Gentleman	No, nor never shall do in such a place as this, she	999
	being once gone.	999
	999
First Gentleman	But to have divinity preached there! did you ever	999
	dream of such a thing?	999
	999
Second Gentleman	No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses:	999
	shall's go hear the vestals sing?	999
	999
First Gentleman	I'll do any thing now that is virtuous; but I	999

	999
SCENE VI	The same. A room in the brothel.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT]	999
	999
Pandar	Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she	999
	had ne'er come here.	999
	999
Bawd	Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god	999
	Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must	999
	either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she	999
	should do for clients her fitment, and do me the	999
	kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,	999
	her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her	999
	knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil,	999
	if he should cheapen a kiss of her.	999
	999
BOULT	'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us	999
	of all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.	999
	999
Pandar	Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!	999
	999
Bawd	'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the	999
	way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.	999
	999
BOULT	We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish	999
	baggage would but give way to customers.	999
	999
	[Enter LYSIMACHUS]	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	How now! How a dozen of virginities?	999
	999
Bawd	Now, the gods to-bless your honour!	999
	999
BOULT	I am glad to see your honour in good health.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	You may so; 'tis the better for you that your	999
	resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!	999
	wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal	999
	withal, and defy the surgeon?	999
	999
Bawd	We have here one, sir, if she would--but there never	999
	came her like in Mytilene.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	If she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.	999
	999
Bawd	Your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Well, call forth, call forth.	999
	999
BOULT	For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall	999
	see a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had but--	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	What, prithee?	999
	999
BOULT	O, sir, I can be modest.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it	999
	gives a good report to a number to be chaste.	999
	999
	[Exit BOULT]	999
	999
Bawd	Here comes that which grows to the stalk; never	999
	plucked yet, I can assure you.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BOULT with MARINA]	999
	999
	Is she not a fair creature?	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.	999
	Well, there's for you: leave us.	999
	999
Bawd	I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and	999
	I'll have done presently.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	I beseech you, do.	999
	999
Bawd	[To MARINA]  First, I would have you note, this is	999
	an honourable man.	999
	999
MARINA	I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.	999
	999
Bawd	Next, he's the governor of this country, and a man	999
	whom I am bound to.	999
	999
MARINA	If he govern the country, you are bound to him	999
	indeed; but how honourable he is in that, I know not.	999
	999
Bawd	Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will	999
	you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.	999
	999
MARINA	What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Ha' you done?	999
	999
Bawd	My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some	999
	pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will	999
	leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Bawd, Pandar, and BOULT]	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?	999
	999
MARINA	What trade, sir?	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Why, I cannot name't but I shall offend.	999
	999
MARINA	I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	How long have you been of this profession?	999
	999
MARINA	E'er since I can remember.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Did you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester at	999
	five or at seven?	999
	999
MARINA	Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a	999
	creature of sale.	999
	999
MARINA	Do you know this house to be a place of such resort,	999
	and will come into 't? I hear say you are of	999
	honourable parts, and are the governor of this place.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?	999
	999
MARINA	Who is my principal?	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots	999
	of shame and iniquity. O, you have heard something	999
	of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious	999
	wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my	999
	authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly	999
	upon thee. Come, bring me to some private place:	999
	come, come.	999
	999
MARINA	If you were born to honour, show it now;	999
	If put upon you, make the judgment good	999
	That thought you worthy of it.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	How's this? how's this? Some more; be sage.	999
	999
MARINA	For me,	999
	That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune	999
	Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,	999
	Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,	999
	O, that the gods	999
	Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,	999
	Though they did change me to the meanest bird	999
	That flies i' the purer air!	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	I did not think	999
	Thou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.	999
	Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,	999
	Thy speech had alter'd it. Hold, here's gold for thee:	999
	Persever in that clear way thou goest,	999
	And the gods strengthen thee!	999
	999
MARINA	The good gods preserve you!	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	For me, be you thoughten	999
	That I came with no ill intent; for to me	999
	The very doors and windows savour vilely.	999
	Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, and	999
	I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.	999
	Hold, here's more gold for thee.	999
	A curse upon him, die he like a thief,	999
	That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost	999
	Hear from me, it shall be for thy good.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BOULT]	999
	999
BOULT	I beseech your honour, one piece for me.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Avaunt, thou damned door-keeper!	999
	Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it,	999
	Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BOULT	How's this? We must take another course with you.	999
	If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a	999
	breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,	999
	shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like	999
	a spaniel. Come your ways.	999
	999
MARINA	 Whither would you have me?	999
	999
BOULT	I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common	999
	hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'll	999
	have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Bawd]	999
	999
Bawd	How now! what's the matter?	999
	999
BOULT	Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holy	999
	words to the Lord Lysimachus.	999
	999
Bawd	O abominable!	999
	999
BOULT	She makes our profession as it were to stink afore	999
	the face of the gods.	999
	999
Bawd	Marry, hang her up for ever!	999
	999
BOULT	The nobleman would have dealt with her like a	999
	nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a	999
	snowball; saying his prayers too.	999
	999
Bawd	Boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure:	999
	crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable.	999
	999
BOULT	An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she	999
	is, she shall be ploughed.	999
	999
MARINA	Hark, hark, you gods!	999
	999
Bawd	She conjures: away with her! Would she had never	999
	come within my doors! Marry, hang you! She's born	999
	to undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?	999
	Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BOULT	Come, mistress; come your ways with me.	999
	999
MARINA	Whither wilt thou have me?	999
	999
BOULT	To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.	999
	999
MARINA	Prithee, tell me one thing first.	999
	999
BOULT	Come now, your one thing.	999
	999
MARINA	What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?	999
	999
BOULT	Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.	999
	999
MARINA	Neither of these are so bad as thou art,	999
	Since they do better thee in their command.	999
	Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend	999
	Of hell would not in reputation change:	999
	Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every	999
	Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;	999
	To the choleric fisting of every rogue	999
	Thy ear is liable; thy food is such	999
	As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.	999
	999
BOULT	What would you have me do? go to the wars, would	999
	you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss	999
	of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to	999
	buy him a wooden one?	999
	999
MARINA	Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty	999
	OLD receptacles, or common shores, of filth;	999
	Serve by indenture to the common hangman:	999
	Any of these ways are yet better than this;	999
	For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,	999
	Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods	999
	Would safely deliver me from this place!	999
	Here, here's gold for thee.	999
	If that thy master would gain by thee,	999
	Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,	999
	With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast:	999
	And I will undertake all these to teach.	999
	I doubt not but this populous city will	999
	Yield many scholars.	999
	999
BOULT	But can you teach all this you speak of?	999
	999
MARINA	Prove that I cannot, take me home again,	999
	And prostitute me to the basest groom	999
	That doth frequent your house.	999
	999
BOULT	Well, I will see what I can do for thee: if I can	999
	place thee, I will.	999
	999
MARINA	But amongst honest women.	999
	999
BOULT	'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.	999
	But since my master and mistress have bought you,	999
	there's no going but by their consent: therefore I	999
	will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I	999
	doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.	999
	Come, I'll do for thee what I can; come your ways.	999

GOWER	Marina thus the brothel 'scapes, and chances	999
	Into an honest house, our story says.	999
	She sings like one immortal, and she dances	999
	As goddess-like to her admired lays;	999
	Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes	999
	Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,	999
	That even her art sisters the natural roses;	999
	Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:	999
	That pupils lacks she none of noble race,	999
	Who pour their bounty on her; and her gain	999
	She gives the cursed bawd. Here we her place;	999
	And to her father turn our thoughts again,	999
	Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;	999
	Whence, driven before the winds, he is arrived	999
	Here where his daughter dwells; and on this coast	999
	Suppose him now at anchor. The city strived	999
	God Neptune's annual feast to keep: from whence	999
	Lysimachus our Tyrian ship espies,	999

SCENE I	On board PERICLES' ship, off Mytilene. A close	999

	within it, reclined on a couch. A barge lying	999
	beside the Tyrian vessel.	999

	999
	[Enter two Sailors, one belonging to the Tyrian	999
	vessel, the other to the barge; to them HELICANUS]	999
	999
Tyrian Sailor	[To the Sailor of Mytilene]  Where is lord Helicanus?	999
	he can resolve you.	999
	O, here he is.	999
	Sir, there's a barge put off from Mytilene,	999
	And in it is Lysimachus the governor,	999
	Who craves to come aboard. What is your will?	999
	999
HELICANUS	That he have his. Call up some gentlemen.	999
	999
Tyrian Sailor	Ho, gentlemen! my lord calls.	999
	999
	[Enter two or three Gentlemen]	999
	999
First Gentleman	Doth your lordship call?	999
	999
HELICANUS	Gentlemen, there's some of worth would come aboard;	999
	I pray ye, greet them fairly.	999
	999
	[The Gentlemen and the two Sailors descend, and go	999
	on board the barge]	999
	999
	[Enter, from thence, LYSIMACHUS and Lords; with the	999
	Gentlemen and the two Sailors]	999
	999
Tyrian Sailor	Sir,	999
	This is the man that can, in aught you would,	999
	Resolve you.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Hail, reverend sir! the gods preserve you!	999
	999
HELICANUS	And you, sir, to outlive the age I am,	999
	And die as I would do.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	You wish me well.	999
	Being on shore, honouring of Neptune's triumphs,	999
	Seeing this goodly vessel ride before us,	999
	I made to it, to know of whence you are.	999
	999
HELICANUS	First, what is your place?	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	I am the governor of this place you lie before.	999
	999
HELICANUS	Sir,	999
	Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;	999
	A man who for this three months hath not spoken	999
	To any one, nor taken sustenance	999
	But to prorogue his grief.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Upon what ground is his distemperature?	999
	999
HELICANUS	'Twould be too tedious to repeat;	999
	But the main grief springs from the loss	999
	Of a beloved daughter and a wife.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	May we not see him?	999
	999
HELICANUS	You may;	999
	But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Yet let me obtain my wish.	999
	999
HELICANUS	Behold him.	999
	999
	[PERICLES discovered]	999
	999
	This was a goodly person,	999
	Till the disaster that, one mortal night,	999
	Drove him to this.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!	999
	Hail, royal sir!	999
	999
HELICANUS	It is in vain; he will not speak to you.	999
	999
First Lord	Sir,	999
	We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,	999
	Would win some words of him.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	'Tis well bethought.	999
	She questionless with her sweet harmony	999
	And other chosen attractions, would allure,	999
	And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,	999
	Which now are midway stopp'd:	999
	She is all happy as the fairest of all,	999
	And, with her fellow maids is now upon	999
	The leafy shelter that abuts against	999
	The island's side.	999
	999
	[Whispers a Lord, who goes off in the barge of	999
	LYSIMACHUS]	999
	999
HELICANUS	Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit	999
	That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness	999
	We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you	999
	That for our gold we may provision have,	999
	Wherein we are not destitute for want,	999
	But weary for the staleness.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	O, sir, a courtesy	999
	Which if we should deny, the most just gods	999
	For every graff would send a caterpillar,	999
	And so afflict our province. Yet once more	999
	Let me entreat to know at large the cause	999
	Of your king's sorrow.	999
	999
HELICANUS	Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:	999
	But, see, I am prevented.	999
	999
	[Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA, and a	999
	young Lady]	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	O, here is	999
	The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!	999
	Is't not a goodly presence?	999
	999
HELICANUS	She's a gallant lady.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	She's such a one, that, were I well assured	999
	Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,	999
	I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.	999
	Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty	999
	Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:	999
	If that thy prosperous and artificial feat	999
	Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,	999
	Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay	999
	As thy desires can wish.	999
	999
MARINA	Sir, I will use	999
	My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided	999
	That none but I and my companion maid	999
	Be suffer'd to come near him.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Come, let us leave her;	999
	And the gods make her prosperous!	999
	999
	[MARINA sings]	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Mark'd he your music?	999
	999
MARINA	No, nor look'd on us.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	See, she will speak to him.	999
	999
MARINA	Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.	999
	999
PERICLES	Hum, ha!	999
	999
MARINA	I am a maid,	999
	My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,	999
	But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,	999
	My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief	999
	Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.	999
	Though wayward fortune did malign my state,	999
	My derivation was from ancestors	999
	Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:	999
	But time hath rooted out my parentage,	999
	And to the world and awkward casualties	999
	Bound me in servitude.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
		 I will desist;	999
	But there is something glows upon my cheek,	999
	And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'	999
	999
PERICLES	My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--	999
	To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?	999
	999
MARINA	I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,	999
	You would not do me violence.	999
	999
PERICLES	I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.	999
	You are like something that--What country-woman?	999
	Here of these shores?	999
	999
MARINA	No, nor of any shores:	999
	Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am	999
	No other than I appear.	999
	999
PERICLES	I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.	999
	My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one	999
	My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;	999
	Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;	999
	As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like	999
	And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;	999
	Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,	999
	The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?	999
	999
MARINA	Where I am but a stranger: from the deck	999
	You may discern the place.	999
	999
PERICLES	Where were you bred?	999
	And how achieved you these endowments, which	999
	You make more rich to owe?	999
	999
MARINA	If I should tell my history, it would seem	999
	Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.	999
	999
PERICLES	Prithee, speak:	999
	Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st	999
	Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace	999
	For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will	999
	believe thee,	999
	And make my senses credit thy relation	999
	To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st	999
	Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?	999
	Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--	999
	Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest	999
	From good descending?	999
	999
MARINA	So indeed I did.	999
	999
PERICLES	Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st	999
	Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,	999
	And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,	999
	If both were open'd.	999
	999
MARINA	Some such thing	999
	I said, and said no more but what my thoughts	999
	Did warrant me was likely.	999
	999
PERICLES	Tell thy story;	999
	If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part	999
	Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I	999
	Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look	999
	Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling	999
	Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?	999
	How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?	999
	Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.	999
	999
MARINA	My name is Marina.	999
	999
PERICLES	                  O, I am mock'd,	999
	And thou by some incensed god sent hither	999
	To make the world to laugh at me.	999
	999
MARINA	Patience, good sir,	999
	Or here I'll cease.	999
	999
PERICLES	Nay, I'll be patient.	999
	Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,	999
	To call thyself Marina.	999
	999
MARINA	The name	999
	Was given me by one that had some power,	999
	My father, and a king.	999
	999
PERICLES	How! a king's daughter?	999
	And call'd Marina?	999
	999
MARINA	                  You said you would believe me;	999
	But, not to be a troubler of your peace,	999
	I will end here.	999
	999
PERICLES	                  But are you flesh and blood?	999
	Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?	999
	Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?	999
	And wherefore call'd Marina?	999
	999
MARINA	Call'd Marina	999
	For I was born at sea.	999
	999
PERICLES	At sea! what mother?	999
	999
MARINA	My mother was the daughter of a king;	999
	Who died the minute I was born,	999
	As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft	999
	Deliver'd weeping.	999
	999
PERICLES	                  O, stop there a little!	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep	999
	Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:	999
	My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?	999
	I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,	999
	And never interrupt you.	999
	999
MARINA	You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.	999
	999
PERICLES	I will believe you by the syllable	999
	Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:	999
	How came you in these parts? where were you bred?	999
	999
MARINA	The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;	999
	Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,	999
	Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd	999
	A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,	999
	A crew of pirates came and rescued me;	999
	Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,	999
	Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?	999
	It may be,	999
	You think me an impostor: no, good faith;	999
	I am the daughter to King Pericles,	999
	If good King Pericles be.	999
	999
PERICLES	Ho, Helicanus!	999
	999
HELICANUS	Calls my lord?	999
	999
PERICLES	Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,	999
	Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,	999
	What this maid is, or what is like to be,	999
	That thus hath made me weep?	999
	999
HELICANUS	I know not; but	999
	Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene	999
	Speaks nobly of her.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	She would never tell	999
	Her parentage; being demanded that,	999
	She would sit still and weep.	999
	999
PERICLES	O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir;	999
	Give me a gash, put me to present pain;	999
	Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me	999
	O'erbear the shores of my mortality,	999
	And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,	999
	Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;	999
	Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,	999
	And found at sea again! O Helicanus,	999
	Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud	999
	As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.	999
	What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,	999
	For truth can never be confirm'd enough,	999
	Though doubts did ever sleep.	999
	999
MARINA	First, sir, I pray,	999
	What is your title?	999
	999
PERICLES	I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now	999
	My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said	999
	Thou hast been godlike perfect,	999
	The heir of kingdoms and another like	999
	To Pericles thy father.	999
	999
MARINA	Is it no more to be your daughter than	999
	To say my mother's name was Thaisa?	999
	Thaisa was my mother, who did end	999
	The minute I began.	999
	999
PERICLES	Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.	999
	Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;	999
	She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,	999
	By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;	999
	When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge	999
	She is thy very princess. Who is this?	999
	999
HELICANUS	Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,	999
	Who, hearing of your melancholy state,	999
	Did come to see you.	999
	999
PERICLES	I embrace you.	999
	Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.	999
	O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?	999
	Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him	999
	O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,	999
	How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?	999
	999
HELICANUS	My lord, I hear none.	999
	999
PERICLES	None!	999
	The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	It is not good to cross him; give him way.	999
	999
PERICLES	Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	My lord, I hear.	999
	999
	[Music]	999
	999
PERICLES	Most heavenly music!	999
	It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber	999
	Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.	999
	999
	[Sleeps]	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	A pillow for his head:	999
	So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,	999
	If this but answer to my just belief,	999
	I'll well remember you.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but PERICLES]	999
	999
	[DIANA appears to PERICLES as in a vision]	999
	999
DIANA	My temple stands in Ephesus: hie thee thither,	999
	And do upon mine altar sacrifice.	999
	There, when my maiden priests are met together,	999
	Before the people all,	999
	Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:	999
	To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call	999
	And give them repetition to the life.	999
	Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;	999
	Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!	999
	Awake, and tell thy dream.	999

	999
HELICANUS	Sir?	999
	999
PERICLES	My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike	999
	The inhospitable Cleon; but I am	999
	For other service first: toward Ephesus	999
	Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.	999
	999
	[To LYSIMACHUS]	999
	999
	Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,	999
	And give you gold for such provision	999
	As our intents will need?	999
	999
LYSIMACHUS	Sir,	999
	With all my heart; and, when you come ashore,	999
	I have another suit.	999
	999
PERICLES	You shall prevail,	999
	Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems	999
	You have been noble towards her.	999
	999

	This, my last boon, give me,	999
	For such kindness must relieve me,	999
	That you aptly will suppose	999
	What pageantry, what feats, what shows,	999
	What minstrelsy, and pretty din,	999
	The regent made in Mytilene	999
	To greet the king. So he thrived,	999
	That he is promised to be wived	999
	To fair Marina; but in no wise	999

	999
SCENE III	The temple of Diana at Ephesus; THAISA standing	999
	near the altar, as high priestess; a number of	999
	Virgins on each side; CERIMON and other Inhabitants	999
	of Ephesus attending.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PERICLES, with his train; LYSIMACHUS,	999
	HELICANUS, MARINA, and a Lady]	999
	999
PERICLES	Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,	999
	I here confess myself the king of Tyre;	999
	Who, frighted from my country, did wed	999
	At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.	999
	At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth	999
	A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,	999
	Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus	999
	Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years	999
	He sought to murder: but her better stars	999
	Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore	999
	Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,	999
	Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she	999
	Made known herself my daughter.	999
	999
THAISA	Voice and favour!	999
	You are, you are--O royal Pericles!	999
	999
	[Faints]	999
	999
PERICLES	What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!	999
	999
CERIMON	Noble sir,	999
	If you have told Diana's altar true,	999
	This is your wife.	999
	999
PERICLES	                  Reverend appearer, no;	999
	I threw her overboard with these very arms.	999
	999
CERIMON	Upon this coast, I warrant you.	999
	999
PERICLES	'Tis most certain.	999
	999
CERIMON	Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.	999
	Early in blustering morn this lady was	999
	Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,	999
	Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her	999
	Here in Diana's temple.	999
	999
PERICLES	May we see them?	999
	999
CERIMON	Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,	999
	Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.	999
	999
THAISA	O, let me look!	999
	If he be none of mine, my sanctity	999
	Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,	999
	But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,	999
	Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,	999
	Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,	999
	A birth, and death?	999
	999
PERICLES	The voice of dead Thaisa!	999
	999
THAISA	That Thaisa am I, supposed dead	999
	And drown'd.	999
	999
PERICLES	Immortal Dian!	999
	999
THAISA	                  Now I know you better.	999
	When we with tears parted Pentapolis,	999
	The king my father gave you such a ring.	999
	999
	[Shows a ring]	999
	999
PERICLES	This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness	999
	Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,	999
	That on the touching of her lips I may	999
	Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried	999
	A second time within these arms.	999
	999
MARINA	My heart	999
	Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.	999
	999
	[Kneels to THAISA]	999
	999
PERICLES	Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;	999
	Thy burden at the sea, and call'd Marina	999
	For she was yielded there.	999
	999
THAISA	Blest, and mine own!	999
	999
HELICANUS	Hail, madam, and my queen!	999
	999
THAISA	I know you not.	999
	999
PERICLES	You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,	999
	I left behind an ancient substitute:	999
	Can you remember what I call'd the man?	999
	I have named him oft.	999
	999
THAISA	'Twas Helicanus then.	999
	999
PERICLES	Still confirmation:	999
	Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.	999
	Now do I long to hear how you were found;	999
	How possibly preserved; and who to thank,	999
	Besides the gods, for this great miracle.	999
	999
THAISA	Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,	999
	Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can	999
	From first to last resolve you.	999
	999
PERICLES	Reverend sir,	999
	The gods can have no mortal officer	999
	More like a god than you. Will you deliver	999
	How this dead queen re-lives?	999
	999
CERIMON	I will, my lord.	999
	Beseech you, first go with me to my house,	999
	Where shall be shown you all was found with her;	999
	How she came placed here in the temple;	999
	No needful thing omitted.	999
	999
PERICLES	Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I	999
	Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,	999
	This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,	999
	Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,	999
	This ornament	999
	Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;	999
	And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,	999
	To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.	999
	999
THAISA	Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,	999
	My father's dead.	999
	999
PERICLES	Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,	999
	We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves	999
	Will in that kingdom spend our following days:	999
	Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.	999
	Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay	999
	To hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.	999

	[Exeunt]	999

	[Enter GOWER]	999

GOWER	In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard	999

	In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,	999
	Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,	999
	Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,	999
	Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:	999
	In Helicanus may you well descry	999
	A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:	999
	In reverend Cerimon there well appears	999
	The worth that learned charity aye wears:	999
	For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame	999
	Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name	999
	Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,	999
	That him and his they in his palace burn;	999
	The gods for murder seemed so content	999
	To punish them; although not done, but meant.	999
	So, on your patience evermore attending,	999
	New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.	999

	999
SCENE I	Before an alehouse on a heath.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Hostess and SLY]	999
	999
SLY	I'll pheeze you, in faith.	999
	999
Hostess	A pair of stocks, you rogue!	999
	999
SLY	Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in	999
	the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.	999
	Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!	999
	999
Hostess	You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?	999
	999
SLY	No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold	999
	bed, and warm thee.	999
	999
Hostess	I know my remedy; I must go fetch the	999
	third--borough.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SLY	Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him	999
	by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,	999
	and kindly.	999
	999
	[Falls asleep]	999
	999
	[Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train]	999
	999
Lord	Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:	999
	Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;	999
	And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.	999
	Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good	999
	At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?	999
	I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.	999
	999
First Huntsman	Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;	999
	He cried upon it at the merest loss	999
	And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:	999
	Trust me, I take him for the better dog.	999
	999
Lord	Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,	999
	I would esteem him worth a dozen such.	999
	But sup them well and look unto them all:	999
	To-morrow I intend to hunt again.	999
	999
First Huntsman	I will, my lord.	999
	999
Lord	What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?	999
	999
Second Huntsman	He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,	999
	This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.	999
	999
Lord	O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!	999
	Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!	999
	Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.	999
	What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,	999
	Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,	999
	A most delicious banquet by his bed,	999
	And brave attendants near him when he wakes,	999
	Would not the beggar then forget himself?	999
	999
First Huntsman	Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.	999
	999
Second Huntsman	It would seem strange unto him when he waked.	999
	999
Lord	Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.	999
	Then take him up and manage well the jest:	999
	Carry him gently to my fairest chamber	999
	And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:	999
	Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters	999
	And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:	999
	Procure me music ready when he wakes,	999
	To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;	999
	And if he chance to speak, be ready straight	999
	And with a low submissive reverence	999
	Say 'What is it your honour will command?'	999
	Let one attend him with a silver basin	999
	Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,	999
	Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,	999
	And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'	999
	Some one be ready with a costly suit	999
	And ask him what apparel he will wear;	999
	Another tell him of his hounds and horse,	999
	And that his lady mourns at his disease:	999
	Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;	999
	And when he says he is, say that he dreams,	999
	For he is nothing but a mighty lord.	999
	This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:	999
	It will be pastime passing excellent,	999
	If it be husbanded with modesty.	999
	999
First Huntsman	My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,	999
	As he shall think by our true diligence	999
	He is no less than what we say he is.	999
	999
Lord	Take him up gently and to bed with him;	999
	And each one to his office when he wakes.	999
	999
	[Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds]	999
	999
	Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:	999
	999
	[Exit Servingman]	999
	999
	Belike, some noble gentleman that means,	999
	Travelling some journey, to repose him here.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Servingman]	999
	999
	How now! who is it?	999
	999
Servant	An't please your honour, players	999
	That offer service to your lordship.	999
	999
Lord	Bid them come near.	999
	999
	[Enter Players]	999
	999
	Now, fellows, you are welcome.	999
	999
Players	We thank your honour.	999
	999
Lord	Do you intend to stay with me tonight?	999
	999
A Player	So please your lordship to accept our duty.	999
	999
Lord	With all my heart. This fellow I remember,	999
	Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:	999
	'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:	999
	I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part	999
	Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.	999
	999
A Player	I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.	999
	999
Lord	'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.	999
	Well, you are come to me in a happy time;	999
	The rather for I have some sport in hand	999
	Wherein your cunning can assist me much.	999
	There is a lord will hear you play to-night:	999
	But I am doubtful of your modesties;	999
	Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--	999
	For yet his honour never heard a play--	999
	You break into some merry passion	999
	And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,	999
	If you should smile he grows impatient.	999
	999
A Player	Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,	999
	Were he the veriest antic in the world.	999
	999
Lord	Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,	999
	And give them friendly welcome every one:	999
	Let them want nothing that my house affords.	999
	999
	[Exit one with the Players]	999
	999
	Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,	999
	And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:	999
	That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;	999
	And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.	999
	Tell him from me, as he will win my love,	999
	He bear himself with honourable action,	999
	Such as he hath observed in noble ladies	999
	Unto their lords, by them accomplished:	999
	Such duty to the drunkard let him do	999
	With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,	999
	And say 'What is't your honour will command,	999
	Wherein your lady and your humble wife	999
	May show her duty and make known her love?'	999
	And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,	999
	And with declining head into his bosom,	999
	Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd	999
	To see her noble lord restored to health,	999
	Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him	999
	No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:	999
	And if the boy have not a woman's gift	999
	To rain a shower of commanded tears,	999
	An onion will do well for such a shift,	999
	Which in a napkin being close convey'd	999
	Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.	999
	See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:	999
	Anon I'll give thee more instructions.	999
	999
	[Exit a Servingman]	999
	999
	I know the boy will well usurp the grace,	999
	Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:	999
	I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,	999
	And how my men will stay themselves from laughter	999
	When they do homage to this simple peasant.	999
	I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence	999
	May well abate the over-merry spleen	999
	Which otherwise would grow into extremes.	999

SCENE II	A bedchamber in the Lord's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter aloft SLY, with Attendants; some with apparel,	999
	others with basin and ewer and appurtenances; and Lord]	999
	999
SLY	For God's sake, a pot of small ale.	999
	999
First Servant	Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?	999
	999
Second Servant	Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?	999
	999
Third Servant	What raiment will your honour wear to-day?	999
	999
SLY	I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor	999
	'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if	999
	you give me any conserves, give me conserves of	999
	beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I	999
	have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings	999
	than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,	999
	sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my	999
	toes look through the over-leather.	999
	999
Lord	Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!	999
	O, that a mighty man of such descent,	999
	Of such possessions and so high esteem,	999
	Should be infused with so foul a spirit!	999
	999
SLY	What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher	999
	Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a	999
	pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a	999
	bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?	999
	Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if	999
	she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence	999
	on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the	999
	lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not	999
	bestraught: here's--	999
	999
Third Servant	O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!	999
	999
Second Servant	O, this is it that makes your servants droop!	999
	999
Lord	Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,	999
	As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.	999
	O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,	999
	Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment	999
	And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.	999
	Look how thy servants do attend on thee,	999
	Each in his office ready at thy beck.	999
	Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,	999
	999
	[Music]	999
	999
	And twenty caged nightingales do sing:	999
	Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch	999
	Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed	999
	On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.	999
	Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:	999
	Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,	999
	Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.	999
	Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar	999
	Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?	999
	Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them	999
	And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.	999
	999
First Servant	Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift	999
	As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.	999
	999
Second Servant	Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight	999
	Adonis painted by a running brook,	999
	And Cytherea all in sedges hid,	999
	Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,	999
	Even as the waving sedges play with wind.	999
	999
Lord	We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,	999
	And how she was beguiled and surprised,	999
	As lively painted as the deed was done.	999
	999
Third Servant	Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,	999
	Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,	999
	And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,	999
	So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.	999
	999
Lord	Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:	999
	Thou hast a lady far more beautiful	999
	Than any woman in this waning age.	999
	999
First Servant	And till the tears that she hath shed for thee	999
	Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,	999
	She was the fairest creature in the world;	999
	And yet she is inferior to none.	999
	999
SLY	Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?	999
	Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?	999
	I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;	999
	I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:	999
	Upon my life, I am a lord indeed	999
	And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.	999
	Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;	999
	And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.	999
	999
Second Servant	Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?	999
	O, how we joy to see your wit restored!	999
	O, that once more you knew but what you are!	999
	These fifteen years you have been in a dream;	999
	Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.	999
	999
SLY	These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.	999
	But did I never speak of all that time?	999
	999
First Servant	O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:	999
	For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,	999
	Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;	999
	And rail upon the hostess of the house;	999
	And say you would present her at the leet,	999
	Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:	999
	Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.	999
	999
SLY	Ay, the woman's maid of the house.	999
	999
Third Servant	Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,	999
	Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,	999
	As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece	999
	And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell	999
	And twenty more such names and men as these	999
	Which never were nor no man ever saw.	999
	999
SLY	Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!	999
	999
ALL	Amen.	999
	999
SLY	I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.	999
	999
	[Enter the Page as a lady, with attendants]	999
	999
Page	How fares my noble lord?	999
	999
SLY	Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough.	999
	Where is my wife?	999
	999
Page	Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?	999
	999
SLY	Are you my wife and will not call me husband?	999
	My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.	999
	999
Page	My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;	999
	I am your wife in all obedience.	999
	999
SLY	I know it well. What must I call her?	999
	999
Lord	Madam.	999
	999
SLY	Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?	999
	999
Lord	'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords	999
	call ladies.	999
	999
SLY	Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd	999
	And slept above some fifteen year or more.	999
	999
Page	Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,	999
	Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.	999
	999
SLY	'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.	999
	Madam, undress you and come now to bed.	999
	999
Page	Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you	999
	To pardon me yet for a night or two,	999
	Or, if not so, until the sun be set:	999
	For your physicians have expressly charged,	999
	In peril to incur your former malady,	999
	That I should yet absent me from your bed:	999
	I hope this reason stands for my excuse.	999
	999
SLY	Ay, it stands so that I may hardly	999
	tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into	999
	my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in	999
	despite of the flesh and the blood.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	Your honour's players, heating your amendment,	999
	Are come to play a pleasant comedy;	999
	For so your doctors hold it very meet,	999
	Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,	999
	And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:	999
	Therefore they thought it good you hear a play	999
	And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,	999
	Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.	999
	999
SLY	Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a	999
	comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?	999
	999
Page	No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.	999
	999
SLY	What, household stuff?	999
	999
Page	It is a kind of history.	999
	999
SLY	Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side	999
	and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.	999

	999
SCENE I	Padua. A public place.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO]	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Tranio, since for the great desire I had	999
	To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,	999
	I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,	999
	The pleasant garden of great Italy;	999
	And by my father's love and leave am arm'd	999
	With his good will and thy good company,	999
	My trusty servant, well approved in all,	999
	Here let us breathe and haply institute	999
	A course of learning and ingenious studies.	999
	Pisa renown'd for grave citizens	999
	Gave me my being and my father first,	999
	A merchant of great traffic through the world,	999
	Vincetino come of Bentivolii.	999
	Vincetino's son brought up in Florence	999
	It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,	999
	To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:	999
	And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,	999
	Virtue and that part of philosophy	999
	Will I apply that treats of happiness	999
	By virtue specially to be achieved.	999
	Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left	999
	And am to Padua come, as he that leaves	999
	A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep	999
	And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.	999
	999
TRANIO	Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,	999
	I am in all affected as yourself;	999
	Glad that you thus continue your resolve	999
	To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.	999
	Only, good master, while we do admire	999
	This virtue and this moral discipline,	999
	Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;	999
	Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques	999
	As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:	999
	Balk logic with acquaintance that you have	999
	And practise rhetoric in your common talk;	999
	Music and poesy use to quicken you;	999
	The mathematics and the metaphysics,	999
	Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;	999
	No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:	999
	In brief, sir, study what you most affect.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.	999
	If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,	999
	We could at once put us in readiness,	999
	And take a lodging fit to entertain	999
	Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.	999
	But stay a while: what company is this?	999
	999
TRANIO	Master, some show to welcome us to town.	999
	999
	[Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and	999
	HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by]	999

BAPTISTA	Gentlemen, importune me no farther,	999
	For how I firmly am resolved you know;	999
	That is, not bestow my youngest daughter	999
	Before I have a husband for the elder:	999
	If either of you both love Katharina,	999
	Because I know you well and love you well,	999
	Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.	999
	999
GREMIO	[Aside]  To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.	999
	There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife?	999
	999
KATHARINA	I pray you, sir, is it your will	999
	To make a stale of me amongst these mates?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,	999
	Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.	999
	999
KATHARINA	I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:	999
	I wis it is not half way to her heart;	999
	But if it were, doubt not her care should be	999
	To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool	999
	And paint your face and use you like a fool.	999
	999
HORTENSIA	From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!	999
	999
GREMIO	And me too, good Lord!	999
	999
TRANIO	Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:	999
	That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	But in the other's silence do I see	999
	Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.	999
	Peace, Tranio!	999
	999
TRANIO	Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Gentlemen, that I may soon make good	999
	What I have said, Bianca, get you in:	999
	And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,	999
	For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.	999
	999
KATHARINA	A pretty peat! it is best	999
	Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.	999
	999
BIANCA	Sister, content you in my discontent.	999
	Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:	999
	My books and instruments shall be my company,	999
	On them to took and practise by myself.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?	999
	Sorry am I that our good will effects	999
	Bianca's grief.	999
	999
GREMIO	                  Why will you mew her up,	999
	Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,	999
	And make her bear the penance of her tongue?	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:	999
	Go in, Bianca:	999
	999
	[Exit BIANCA]	999
	999
	And for I know she taketh most delight	999
	In music, instruments and poetry,	999
	Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,	999
	Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,	999
	Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,	999
	Prefer them hither; for to cunning men	999
	I will be very kind, and liberal	999
	To mine own children in good bringing up:	999
	And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;	999
	For I have more to commune with Bianca.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KATHARINA	Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,	999
	shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I	999
	knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
GREMIO	You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so	999
	good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not	999
	so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails	999
	together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on	999
	both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my	999
	sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit	999
	man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will	999
	wish him to her father.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.	999
	Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked	999
	parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,	999
	that we may yet again have access to our fair	999
	mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to	999
	labour and effect one thing specially.	999
	999
GREMIO	What's that, I pray?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.	999
	999
GREMIO	A husband! a devil.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	I say, a husband.	999
	999
GREMIO	I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though	999
	her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool	999
	to be married to hell?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine	999
	to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good	999
	fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,	999
	would take her with all faults, and money enough.	999
	999
GREMIO	I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with	999
	this condition, to be whipped at the high cross	999
	every morning.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten	999
	apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us	999
	friends, it shall be so far forth friendly	999
	maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter	999
	to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,	999
	and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man	999
	be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.	999
	How say you, Signior Gremio?	999
	999
GREMIO	I am agreed; and would I had given him the best	999
	horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would	999
	thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the	999
	house of her! Come on.	999
	999
	[Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO]	999
	999
TRANIO	I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible	999
	That love should of a sudden take such hold?	999
	999
LUCENTIO	O Tranio, till I found it to be true,	999
	I never thought it possible or likely;	999
	But see, while idly I stood looking on,	999
	I found the effect of love in idleness:	999
	And now in plainness do confess to thee,	999
	That art to me as secret and as dear	999
	As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,	999
	Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,	999
	If I achieve not this young modest girl.	999
	Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;	999
	Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.	999
	999
TRANIO	Master, it is no time to chide you now;	999
	Affection is not rated from the heart:	999
	If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,	999
	'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:	999
	The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.	999
	999
TRANIO	Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,	999
	Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,	999
	Such as the daughter of Agenor had,	999
	That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.	999
	When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.	999
	999
TRANIO	Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister	999
	Began to scold and raise up such a storm	999
	That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move	999
	And with her breath she did perfume the air:	999
	Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.	999
	999
TRANIO	Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.	999
	I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,	999
	Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:	999
	Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd	999
	That till the father rid his hands of her,	999
	Master, your love must live a maid at home;	999
	And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,	999
	Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!	999
	But art thou not advised, he took some care	999
	To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?	999
	999
TRANIO	Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	I have it, Tranio.	999
	999
TRANIO	                  Master, for my hand,	999
	Both our inventions meet and jump in one.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Tell me thine first.	999
	999
TRANIO	You will be schoolmaster	999
	And undertake the teaching of the maid:	999
	That's your device.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	It is: may it be done?	999
	999
TRANIO	Not possible; for who shall bear your part,	999
	And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,	999
	Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,	999
	Visit his countrymen and banquet them?	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Basta; content thee, for I have it full.	999
	We have not yet been seen in any house,	999
	Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces	999
	For man or master; then it follows thus;	999
	Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,	999
	Keep house and port and servants as I should:	999
	I will some other be, some Florentine,	999
	Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.	999
	'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once	999
	Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:	999
	When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;	999
	But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.	999
	999
TRANIO	So had you need.	999
	In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,	999
	And I am tied to be obedient;	999
	For so your father charged me at our parting,	999
	'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,	999
	Although I think 'twas in another sense;	999
	I am content to be Lucentio,	999
	Because so well I love Lucentio.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:	999
	And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid	999
	Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.	999
	Here comes the rogue.	999
	999
	[Enter BIONDELLO]	999
	999
		Sirrah, where have you been?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?	999
	Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or	999
	you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,	999
	And therefore frame your manners to the time.	999
	Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,	999
	Puts my apparel and my countenance on,	999
	And I for my escape have put on his;	999
	For in a quarrel since I came ashore	999
	I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:	999
	Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,	999
	While I make way from hence to save my life:	999
	You understand me?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	                  I, sir! ne'er a whit.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:	999
	Tranio is changed into Lucentio.	999
	999
BIONDELLO	The better for him: would I were so too!	999
	999
TRANIO	So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,	999
	That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.	999
	But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise	999
	You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:	999
	When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;	999
	But in all places else your master Lucentio.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that	999
	thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if	999
	thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good	999
	and weighty.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[The presenters above speak]	999
	999
First Servant	My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.	999
	999
SLY	Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:	999
	comes there any more of it?	999
	999
Page	My lord, 'tis but begun.	999
	999
SLY	'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:	999
	would 'twere done!	999
	999
	[They sit and mark]	999

	THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO]	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Verona, for a while I take my leave,	999
	To see my friends in Padua, but of all	999
	My best beloved and approved friend,	999
	Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.	999
	Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has	999
	rebused your worship?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that	999
	I should knock you here, sir?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Villain, I say, knock me at this gate	999
	And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.	999
	999
GRUMIO	My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock	999
	you first,	999
	And then I know after who comes by the worst.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Will it not be?	999
	Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;	999
	I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.	999
	999
	[He wrings him by the ears]	999
	999
GRUMIO	Help, masters, help! my master is mad.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!	999
	999
	[Enter HORTENSIO]	999
	999
HORTENSIO	How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!	999
	and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?	999
	'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor	999
	mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound	999
	this quarrel.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.	999
	if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his	999
	service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap	999
	him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to	999
	use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,	999
	two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had	999
	well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,	999
	I bade the rascal knock upon your gate	999
	And could not get him for my heart to do it.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these	999
	words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,	999
	knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you	999
	now with, 'knocking at the gate'?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:	999
	Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,	999
	Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.	999
	And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale	999
	Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Such wind as scatters young men through the world,	999
	To seek their fortunes farther than at home	999
	Where small experience grows. But in a few,	999
	Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:	999
	Antonio, my father, is deceased;	999
	And I have thrust myself into this maze,	999
	Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:	999
	Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,	999
	And so am come abroad to see the world.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee	999
	And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?	999
	Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:	999
	And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich	999
	And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,	999
	And I'll not wish thee to her.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we	999
	Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know	999
	One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,	999
	As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,	999
	Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,	999
	As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd	999
	As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,	999
	She moves me not, or not removes, at least,	999
	Affection's edge in me, were she as rough	999
	As are the swelling Adriatic seas:	999
	I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;	999
	If wealthily, then happily in Padua.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his	999
	mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to	999
	a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er	999
	a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases	999
	as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,	999
	so money comes withal.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,	999
	I will continue that I broach'd in jest.	999
	I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife	999
	With wealth enough and young and beauteous,	999
	Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:	999
	Her only fault, and that is faults enough,	999
	Is that she is intolerable curst	999
	And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure	999
	That, were my state far worser than it is,	999
	I would not wed her for a mine of gold.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:	999
	Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;	999
	For I will board her, though she chide as loud	999
	As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Her father is Baptista Minola,	999
	An affable and courteous gentleman:	999
	Her name is Katharina Minola,	999
	Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	I know her father, though I know not her;	999
	And he knew my deceased father well.	999
	I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;	999
	And therefore let me be thus bold with you	999
	To give you over at this first encounter,	999
	Unless you will accompany me thither.	999
	999
GRUMIO	I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.	999
	O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she	999
	would think scolding would do little good upon him:	999
	she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:	999
	why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in	999
	his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she	999
	stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in	999
	her face and so disfigure her with it that she	999
	shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.	999
	You know him not, sir.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,	999
	For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:	999
	He hath the jewel of my life in hold,	999
	His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,	999
	And her withholds from me and other more,	999
	Suitors to her and rivals in my love,	999
	Supposing it a thing impossible,	999
	For those defects I have before rehearsed,	999
	That ever Katharina will be woo'd;	999
	Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,	999
	That none shall have access unto Bianca	999
	Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Katharina the curst!	999
	A title for a maid of all titles the worst.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,	999
	And offer me disguised in sober robes	999
	To old Baptista as a schoolmaster	999
	Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;	999
	That so I may, by this device, at least	999
	Have leave and leisure to make love to her	999
	And unsuspected court her by herself.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,	999
	how the young folks lay their heads together!	999
	999
	[Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised]	999
	999
	Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.	999
	Petruchio, stand by a while.	999
	999
GRUMIO	A proper stripling and an amorous!	999
	999
GREMIO	O, very well; I have perused the note.	999
	Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:	999
	All books of love, see that at any hand;	999
	And see you read no other lectures to her:	999
	You understand me: over and beside	999
	Signior Baptista's liberality,	999
	I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,	999
	And let me have them very well perfumed	999
	For she is sweeter than perfume itself	999
	To whom they go to. What will you read to her?	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you	999
	As for my patron, stand you so assured,	999
	As firmly as yourself were still in place:	999
	Yea, and perhaps with more successful words	999
	Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.	999
	999
GREMIO	O this learning, what a thing it is!	999
	999
GRUMIO	O this woodcock, what an ass it is!	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Peace, sirrah!	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.	999
	999
GREMIO	And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.	999
	Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.	999
	I promised to inquire carefully	999
	About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:	999
	And by good fortune I have lighted well	999
	On this young man, for learning and behavior	999
	Fit for her turn, well read in poetry	999
	And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman	999
	Hath promised me to help me to another,	999
	A fine musician to instruct our mistress;	999
	So shall I no whit be behind in duty	999
	To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.	999
	999
GREMIO	Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.	999
	999
GRUMIO	And that his bags shall prove.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:	999
	Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,	999
	I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.	999
	Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,	999
	Upon agreement from us to his liking,	999
	Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,	999
	Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.	999
	999
GREMIO	So said, so done, is well.	999
	Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	I know she is an irksome brawling scold:	999
	If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.	999
	999
GREMIO	No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:	999
	My father dead, my fortune lives for me;	999
	And I do hope good days and long to see.	999
	999
GREMIO	O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!	999
	But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:	999
	You shall have me assisting you in all.	999
	But will you woo this wild-cat?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Will I live?	999
	999
GRUMIO	Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Why came I hither but to that intent?	999
	Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?	999
	Have I not in my time heard lions roar?	999
	Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds	999
	Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?	999
	Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,	999
	And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?	999
	Have I not in a pitched battle heard	999
	Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?	999
	And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,	999
	That gives not half so great a blow to hear	999
	As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?	999
	Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.	999
	999
GRUMIO	For he fears none.	999
	999
GREMIO	Hortensio, hark:	999
	This gentleman is happily arrived,	999
	My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	I promised we would be contributors	999
	And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.	999
	999
GREMIO	And so we will, provided that he win her.	999
	999
GRUMIO	I would I were as sure of a good dinner.	999
	999
	[Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO]	999
	999
TRANIO	Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,	999
	Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way	999
	To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?	999
	999
TRANIO	Even he, Biondello.	999
	999
GREMIO	Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--	999
	999
TRANIO	Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.	999
	999
TRANIO	I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Well begun, Tranio.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Sir, a word ere you go;	999
	Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?	999
	999
TRANIO	And if I be, sir, is it any offence?	999
	999
GREMIO	No; if without more words you will get you hence.	999
	999
TRANIO	Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free	999
	For me as for you?	999
	999
GREMIO	                  But so is not she.	999
	999
TRANIO	For what reason, I beseech you?	999
	999
GREMIO	For this reason, if you'll know,	999
	That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.	999
	999
TRANIO	Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,	999
	Do me this right; hear me with patience.	999
	Baptista is a noble gentleman,	999
	To whom my father is not all unknown;	999
	And were his daughter fairer than she is,	999
	She may more suitors have and me for one.	999
	Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;	999
	Then well one more may fair Bianca have:	999
	And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,	999
	Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.	999
	999
GREMIO	What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Hortensio, to what end are all these words?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,	999
	Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?	999
	999
TRANIO	No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,	999
	The one as famous for a scolding tongue	999
	As is the other for beauteous modesty.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.	999
	999
GREMIO	Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;	999
	And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:	999
	The youngest daughter whom you hearken for	999
	Her father keeps from all access of suitors,	999
	And will not promise her to any man	999
	Until the elder sister first be wed:	999
	The younger then is free and not before.	999
	999
TRANIO	If it be so, sir, that you are the man	999
	Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,	999
	And if you break the ice and do this feat,	999
	Achieve the elder, set the younger free	999
	For our access, whose hap shall be to have her	999
	Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;	999
	And since you do profess to be a suitor,	999
	You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,	999
	To whom we all rest generally beholding.	999
	999
TRANIO	Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,	999
	Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,	999
	And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,	999
	And do as adversaries do in law,	999
	Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.	999
	999
	999
GRUMIO	|	999
	|  O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.	999
BIONDELLO	|	999
	999
	999
HORTENSIO	The motion's good indeed and be it so,	999
	Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

	THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	999
	999
	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Padua. A room in BAPTISTA'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA]	999
	999
BIANCA	Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,	999
	To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;	999
	That I disdain: but for these other gawds,	999
	Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,	999
	Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;	999
	Or what you will command me will I do,	999
	So well I know my duty to my elders.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell	999
	Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.	999
	999
BIANCA	Believe me, sister, of all the men alive	999
	I never yet beheld that special face	999
	Which I could fancy more than any other.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?	999
	999
BIANCA	If you affect him, sister, here I swear	999
	I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have	999
	him.	999
	999
KATHARINA	O then, belike, you fancy riches more:	999
	You will have Gremio to keep you fair.	999
	999
BIANCA	Is it for him you do envy me so?	999
	Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive	999
	You have but jested with me all this while:	999
	I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.	999
	999
KATHARINA	If that be jest, then all the rest was so.	999
	999
	[Strikes her]	999
	999
	[Enter BAPTISTA]	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?	999
	Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.	999
	Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.	999
	For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,	999
	Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?	999
	When did she cross thee with a bitter word?	999
	999
KATHARINA	Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.	999
	999
	[Flies after BIANCA]	999
	999
BAPTISTA	What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.	999
	999
	[Exit BIANCA]	999
	999
KATHARINA	What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see	999
	She is your treasure, she must have a husband;	999
	I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day	999
	And for your love to her lead apes in hell.	999
	Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep	999
	Till I can find occasion of revenge.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?	999
	But who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter GREMIO, LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man;	999
	PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician; and TRANIO,	999
	with BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books]	999
	999
GREMIO	Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.	999
	God save you, gentlemen!	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter	999
	Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?	999
	999
BAPTISTA	I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.	999
	999
GREMIO	You are too blunt: go to it orderly.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.	999
	I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,	999
	That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,	999
	Her affability and bashful modesty,	999
	Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,	999
	Am bold to show myself a forward guest	999
	Within your house, to make mine eye the witness	999
	Of that report which I so oft have heard.	999
	And, for an entrance to my entertainment,	999
	I do present you with a man of mine,	999
	999
	[Presenting HORTENSIO]	999
	999
	Cunning in music and the mathematics,	999
	To instruct her fully in those sciences,	999
	Whereof I know she is not ignorant:	999
	Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:	999
	His name is Licio, born in Mantua.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.	999
	But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,	999
	She is not for your turn, the more my grief.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	I see you do not mean to part with her,	999
	Or else you like not of my company.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.	999
	Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,	999
	A man well known throughout all Italy.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.	999
	999
GREMIO	Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,	999
	Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:	999
	Baccare! you are marvellous forward.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.	999
	999
GREMIO	I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your	999
	wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am	999
	sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,	999
	that have been more kindly beholding to you than	999
	any, freely give unto you this young scholar,	999
	999
	[Presenting LUCENTIO]	999
	999
	that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning	999
	in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other	999
	in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,	999
	accept his service.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.	999
	Welcome, good Cambio.	999
	999
	[To TRANIO]	999
	999
	But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:	999
	may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?	999
	999
TRANIO	Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,	999
	That, being a stranger in this city here,	999
	Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,	999
	Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.	999
	Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,	999
	In the preferment of the eldest sister.	999
	This liberty is all that I request,	999
	That, upon knowledge of my parentage,	999
	I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo	999
	And free access and favour as the rest:	999
	And, toward the education of your daughters,	999
	I here bestow a simple instrument,	999
	And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:	999
	If you accept them, then their worth is great.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?	999
	999
TRANIO	Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	A mighty man of Pisa; by report	999
	I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,	999
	Take you the lute, and you the set of books;	999
	You shall go see your pupils presently.	999
	Holla, within!	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
	Sirrah, lead these gentlemen	999
	To my daughters; and tell them both,	999
	These are their tutors: bid them use them well.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO,	999
	BIONDELLO following]	999
	999
	We will go walk a little in the orchard,	999
	And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,	999
	And so I pray you all to think yourselves.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,	999
	And every day I cannot come to woo.	999
	You knew my father well, and in him me,	999
	Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,	999
	Which I have better'd rather than decreased:	999
	Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,	999
	What dowry shall I have with her to wife?	999
	999
BAPTISTA	After my death the one half of my lands,	999
	And in possession twenty thousand crowns.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of	999
	Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,	999
	In all my lands and leases whatsoever:	999
	Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,	999
	That covenants may be kept on either hand.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,	999
	That is, her love; for that is all in all.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,	999
	I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;	999
	And where two raging fires meet together	999
	They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:	999
	Though little fire grows great with little wind,	999
	Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:	999
	So I to her and so she yields to me;	999
	For I am rough and woo not like a babe.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!	999
	But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,	999
	That shake not, though they blow perpetually.	999
	999
	[Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke]	999
	999
BAPTISTA	How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	What, will my daughter prove a good musician?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	I think she'll sooner prove a soldier	999
	Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.	999
	I did but tell her she mistook her frets,	999
	And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;	999
	When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,	999
	'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume	999
	with them:'	999
	And, with that word, she struck me on the head,	999
	And through the instrument my pate made way;	999
	And there I stood amazed for a while,	999
	As on a pillory, looking through the lute;	999
	While she did call me rascal fiddler	999
	And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,	999
	As had she studied to misuse me so.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;	999
	I love her ten times more than e'er I did:	999
	O, how I long to have some chat with her!	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:	999
	Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;	999
	She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.	999
	Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,	999
	Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	I pray you do.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO]	999
	999
	I will attend her here,	999
	And woo her with some spirit when she comes.	999
	Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain	999
	She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:	999
	Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear	999
	As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:	999
	Say she be mute and will not speak a word;	999
	Then I'll commend her volubility,	999
	And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:	999
	If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,	999
	As though she bid me stay by her a week:	999
	If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day	999
	When I shall ask the banns and when be married.	999
	But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.	999
	999
	[Enter KATHARINA]	999
	999
	Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:	999
	They call me Katharina that do talk of me.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,	999
	And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;	999
	But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom	999
	Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,	999
	For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,	999
	Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;	999
	Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,	999
	Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,	999
	Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,	999
	Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither	999
	Remove you hence: I knew you at the first	999
	You were a moveable.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Why, what's a moveable?	999
	999
KATHARINA	A join'd-stool.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Asses are made to bear, and so are you.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Women are made to bear, and so are you.	999
	999
KATHARINA	No such jade as you, if me you mean.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;	999
	For, knowing thee to be but young and light--	999
	999
KATHARINA	Too light for such a swain as you to catch;	999
	And yet as heavy as my weight should be.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Should be! should--buzz!	999
	999
KATHARINA	Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?	999
	999
KATHARINA	Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.	999
	999
KATHARINA	If I be waspish, best beware my sting.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	My remedy is then, to pluck it out.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Who knows not where a wasp does	999
	wear his sting? In his tail.	999
	999
KATHARINA	In his tongue.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Whose tongue?	999
	999
KATHARINA	Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,	999
	Good Kate; I am a gentleman.	999
	999
KATHARINA	That I'll try.	999
	999
	[She strikes him]	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.	999
	999
KATHARINA	So may you lose your arms:	999
	If you strike me, you are no gentleman;	999
	And if no gentleman, why then no arms.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!	999
	999
KATHARINA	What is your crest? a coxcomb?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.	999
	999
KATHARINA	No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.	999
	999
KATHARINA	It is my fashion, when I see a crab.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.	999
	999
KATHARINA	There is, there is.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Then show it me.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Had I a glass, I would.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	What, you mean my face?	999
	999
KATHARINA	Well aim'd of such a young one.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Yet you are wither'd.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	'Tis with cares.	999
	999
KATHARINA	I care not.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.	999
	999
KATHARINA	I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.	999
	'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,	999
	And now I find report a very liar;	999
	For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,	999
	But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:	999
	Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,	999
	Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,	999
	Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,	999
	But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,	999
	With gentle conference, soft and affable.	999
	Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?	999
	O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig	999
	Is straight and slender and as brown in hue	999
	As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.	999
	O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Did ever Dian so become a grove	999
	As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?	999
	O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;	999
	And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!	999
	999
KATHARINA	Where did you study all this goodly speech?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	It is extempore, from my mother-wit.	999
	999
KATHARINA	A witty mother! witless else her son.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Am I not wise?	999
	999
KATHARINA	Yes; keep you warm.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:	999
	And therefore, setting all this chat aside,	999
	Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented	999
	That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;	999
	And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.	999
	Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;	999
	For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,	999
	Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,	999
	Thou must be married to no man but me;	999
	For I am he am born to tame you Kate,	999
	And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate	999
	Conformable as other household Kates.	999
	Here comes your father: never make denial;	999
	I must and will have Katharina to my wife.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO]	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	How but well, sir? how but well?	999
	It were impossible I should speed amiss.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?	999
	999
KATHARINA	Call you me daughter? now, I promise you	999
	You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,	999
	To wish me wed to one half lunatic;	999
	A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,	999
	That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,	999
	That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:	999
	If she be curst, it is for policy,	999
	For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;	999
	She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;	999
	For patience she will prove a second Grissel,	999
	And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:	999
	And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,	999
	That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.	999
	999
KATHARINA	I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.	999
	999
GREMIO	Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee	999
	hang'd first.	999
	999
TRANIO	Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:	999
	If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?	999
	'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,	999
	That she shall still be curst in company.	999
	I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe	999
	How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!	999
	She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss	999
	She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,	999
	That in a twink she won me to her love.	999
	O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,	999
	How tame, when men and women are alone,	999
	A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.	999
	Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,	999
	To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.	999
	Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;	999
	I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	I know not what to say: but give me your hands;	999
	God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.	999
	999
	999
GREMIO	|	999
	|  Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.	999
TRANIO	|	999
	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;	999
	I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:	999
	We will have rings and things and fine array;	999
	And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally]	999
	999
GREMIO	Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,	999
	And venture madly on a desperate mart.	999
	999
TRANIO	'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:	999
	'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.	999
	999
GREMIO	No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.	999
	But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:	999
	Now is the day we long have looked for:	999
	I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.	999
	999
TRANIO	And I am one that love Bianca more	999
	Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.	999
	999
GREMIO	Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.	999
	999
TRANIO	Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.	999
	999
GREMIO	But thine doth fry.	999
	Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.	999
	999
TRANIO	But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:	999
	'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both	999
	That can assure my daughter greatest dower	999
	Shall have my Bianca's love.	999
	Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?	999
	999
GREMIO	First, as you know, my house within the city	999
	Is richly furnished with plate and gold;	999
	Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;	999
	My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;	999
	In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;	999
	In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,	999
	Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,	999
	Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,	999
	Valance of Venice gold in needlework,	999
	Pewter and brass and all things that belong	999
	To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm	999
	I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,	999
	Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,	999
	And all things answerable to this portion.	999
	Myself am struck in years, I must confess;	999
	And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,	999
	If whilst I live she will be only mine.	999
	999
TRANIO	That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:	999
	I am my father's heir and only son:	999
	If I may have your daughter to my wife,	999
	I'll leave her houses three or four as good,	999
	Within rich Pisa walls, as any one	999
	Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;	999
	Besides two thousand ducats by the year	999
	Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.	999
	What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?	999
	999
GREMIO	Two thousand ducats by the year of land!	999
	My land amounts not to so much in all:	999
	That she shall have; besides an argosy	999
	That now is lying in Marseilles' road.	999
	What, have I choked you with an argosy?	999
	999
TRANIO	Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less	999
	Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,	999
	And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,	999
	And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.	999
	999
GREMIO	Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;	999
	And she can have no more than all I have:	999
	If you like me, she shall have me and mine.	999
	999
TRANIO	Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,	999
	By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	I must confess your offer is the best;	999
	And, let your father make her the assurance,	999
	She is your own; else, you must pardon me,	999
	if you should die before him, where's her dower?	999
	999
TRANIO	That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.	999
	999
GREMIO	And may not young men die, as well as old?	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Well, gentlemen,	999
	I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know	999
	My daughter Katharina is to be married:	999
	Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca	999
	Be bride to you, if you this assurance;	999
	If not, Signior Gremio:	999
	And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.	999
	999
GREMIO	Adieu, good neighbour.	999
	999
	[Exit BAPTISTA]	999
	999
		Now I fear thee not:	999
	Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool	999
	To give thee all, and in his waning age	999
	Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!	999
	An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
TRANIO	A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!	999
	Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.	999
	'Tis in my head to do my master good:	999
	I see no reason but supposed Lucentio	999
	Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'	999
	And that's a wonder: fathers commonly	999
	Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,	999
	A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Padua. BAPTISTA'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA]	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:	999
	Have you so soon forgot the entertainment	999
	Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	But, wrangling pedant, this is	999
	The patroness of heavenly harmony:	999
	Then give me leave to have prerogative;	999
	And when in music we have spent an hour,	999
	Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Preposterous ass, that never read so far	999
	To know the cause why music was ordain'd!	999
	Was it not to refresh the mind of man	999
	After his studies or his usual pain?	999
	Then give me leave to read philosophy,	999
	And while I pause, serve in your harmony.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.	999
	999
BIANCA	Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,	999
	To strive for that which resteth in my choice:	999
	I am no breeching scholar in the schools;	999
	I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,	999
	But learn my lessons as I please myself.	999
	And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:	999
	Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;	999
	His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?	999
	999
LUCENTIO	That will be never: tune your instrument.	999
	999
BIANCA	Where left we last?	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Here, madam:	999
	'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;	999
	Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'	999
	999
BIANCA	Construe them.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am	999
	Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,	999
	'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;	999
	'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes	999
	a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'	999
	bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might	999
	beguile the old pantaloon.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Madam, my instrument's in tune.	999
	999
BIANCA	Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.	999
	999
BIANCA	Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat	999
	Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I	999
	trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed	999
	he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'	999
	despair not.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Madam, 'tis now in tune.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	All but the base.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	How fiery and forward our pedant is!	999
	Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:	999
	Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.	999
	999
BIANCA	In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides	999
	Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.	999
	999
BIANCA	I must believe my master; else, I promise you,	999
	I should be arguing still upon that doubt:	999
	But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:	999
	Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,	999
	That I have been thus pleasant with you both.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	You may go walk, and give me leave a while:	999
	My lessons make no music in three parts.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,	999
	Our fine musician groweth amorous.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Madam, before you touch the instrument,	999
	To learn the order of my fingering,	999
	I must begin with rudiments of art;	999
	To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,	999
	More pleasant, pithy and effectual,	999
	Than hath been taught by any of my trade:	999
	And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.	999
	999
BIANCA	Why, I am past my gamut long ago.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.	999
	999
BIANCA	[Reads]  ''Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,	999
	'A re,' to Plead Hortensio's passion;	999
	'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,	999
	'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection:	999
	'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:	999
	'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.'	999
	Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not:	999
	Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,	999
	To change true rules for old inventions.	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
Servant	Mistress, your father prays you leave your books	999
	And help to dress your sister's chamber up:	999
	You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.	999
	999
BIANCA	Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BIANCA and Servant]	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HORTENSIO	But I have cause to pry into this pedant:	999
	Methinks he looks as though he were in love:	999
	Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble	999
	To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,	999
	Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,	999
	Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA,	999
	LUCENTIO, and others, attendants]	999
	999
BAPTISTA	[To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio, this is the	999
	'pointed day.	999
	That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,	999
	And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.	999
	What will be said? what mockery will it be,	999
	To want the bridegroom when the priest attends	999
	To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!	999
	What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?	999
	999
KATHARINA	No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced	999
	To give my hand opposed against my heart	999
	Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;	999
	Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.	999
	I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,	999
	Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:	999
	And, to be noted for a merry man,	999
	He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,	999
	Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;	999
	Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.	999
	Now must the world point at poor Katharina,	999
	And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,	999
	If it would please him come and marry her!'	999
	999
TRANIO	Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.	999
	Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,	999
	Whatever fortune stays him from his word:	999
	Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;	999
	Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Would Katharina had never seen him though!	999
	999
	[Exit weeping, followed by BIANCA and others]	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;	999
	For such an injury would vex a very saint,	999
	Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.	999
	999
	[Enter BIONDELLO]	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Master, master! news, old news, and such news as	999
	you never heard of!	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Is it new and old too? how may that be?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Is he come?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Why, no, sir.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	What then?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	He is coming.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	When will he be here?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	When he stands where I am and sees you there.	999
	999
TRANIO	But say, what to thine old news?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old	999
	jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair	999
	of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,	999
	another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the	999
	town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;	999
	with two broken points: his horse hipped with an	999
	old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;	999
	besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose	999
	in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected	999
	with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with	999
	spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,	999
	stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the	999
	bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;	999
	near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit	999
	and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being	999
	restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been	999
	often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth	999
	six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,	999
	which hath two letters for her name fairly set down	999
	in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Who comes with him?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned	999
	like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a	999
	kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red	999
	and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty	999
	fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a	999
	very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian	999
	footboy or a gentleman's lackey.	999
	999
TRANIO	'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;	999
	Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Why, sir, he comes not.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Didst thou not say he comes?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Who? that Petruchio came?	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Ay, that Petruchio came.	999
	999
BIONDELLO	No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Why, that's all one.	999
	999
BIONDELLO	   Nay, by Saint Jamy,	999
	I hold you a penny,	999
	A horse and a man	999
	Is more than one,	999
	And yet not many.	999
	999
	[Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO]	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?	999
	999
BAPTISTA	You are welcome, sir.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	And yet I come not well.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	And yet you halt not.	999
	999
TRANIO	Not so well apparell'd	999
	As I wish you were.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Were it better, I should rush in thus.	999
	But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?	999
	How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:	999
	And wherefore gaze this goodly company,	999
	As if they saw some wondrous monument,	999
	Some comet or unusual prodigy?	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:	999
	First were we sad, fearing you would not come;	999
	Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.	999
	Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,	999
	An eye-sore to our solemn festival!	999
	999
TRANIO	And tells us, what occasion of import	999
	Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,	999
	And sent you hither so unlike yourself?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:	999
	Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,	999
	Though in some part enforced to digress;	999
	Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse	999
	As you shall well be satisfied withal.	999
	But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:	999
	The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.	999
	999
TRANIO	See not your bride in these unreverent robes:	999
	Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:	999
	To me she's married, not unto my clothes:	999
	Could I repair what she will wear in me,	999
	As I can change these poor accoutrements,	999
	'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.	999
	But what a fool am I to chat with you,	999
	When I should bid good morrow to my bride,	999
	And seal the title with a lovely kiss!	999
	999
	[Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO]	999
	999
TRANIO	He hath some meaning in his mad attire:	999
	We will persuade him, be it possible,	999
	To put on better ere he go to church.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	I'll after him, and see the event of this.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and attendants]	999
	999
TRANIO	But to her love concerneth us to add	999
	Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,	999
	As I before unparted to your worship,	999
	I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,	999
	It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--	999
	And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;	999
	And make assurance here in Padua	999
	Of greater sums than I have promised.	999
	So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,	999
	And marry sweet Bianca with consent.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Were it not that my fellow-school-master	999
	Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,	999
	'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;	999
	Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,	999
	I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.	999
	999
TRANIO	That by degrees we mean to look into,	999
	And watch our vantage in this business:	999
	We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,	999
	The narrow-prying father, Minola,	999
	The quaint musician, amorous Licio;	999
	All for my master's sake, Lucentio.	999
	999
	[Re-enter GREMIO]	999
	999
	Signior Gremio, came you from the church?	999
	999
GREMIO	As willingly as e'er I came from school.	999
	999
TRANIO	And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?	999
	999
GREMIO	A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,	999
	A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.	999
	999
TRANIO	Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.	999
	999
GREMIO	Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.	999
	999
TRANIO	Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.	999
	999
GREMIO	Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!	999
	I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest	999
	Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,	999
	'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,	999
	That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;	999
	And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,	999
	The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff	999
	That down fell priest and book and book and priest:	999
	'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'	999
	999
TRANIO	What said the wench when he rose again?	999
	999
GREMIO	Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,	999
	As if the vicar meant to cozen him.	999
	But after many ceremonies done,	999
	He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if	999
	He had been aboard, carousing to his mates	999
	After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel	999
	And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;	999
	Having no other reason	999
	But that his beard grew thin and hungerly	999
	And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.	999
	This done, he took the bride about the neck	999
	And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack	999
	That at the parting all the church did echo:	999
	And I seeing this came thence for very shame;	999
	And after me, I know, the rout is coming.	999
	Such a mad marriage never was before:	999
	Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.	999
	999
	[Music]	999

	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:	999
	I know you think to dine with me to-day,	999
	And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;	999
	But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,	999
	And therefore here I mean to take my leave.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Is't possible you will away to-night?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	I must away to-day, before night come:	999
	Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,	999
	You would entreat me rather go than stay.	999
	And, honest company, I thank you all,	999
	That have beheld me give away myself	999
	To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:	999
	Dine with my father, drink a health to me;	999
	For I must hence; and farewell to you all.	999
	999
TRANIO	Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	It may not be.	999
	999
GREMIO	                  Let me entreat you.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	It cannot be.	999
	999
KATHARINA	                  Let me entreat you.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	I am content.	999
	999
KATHARINA	                  Are you content to stay?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	I am content you shall entreat me stay;	999
	But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Now, if you love me, stay.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Grumio, my horse.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Nay, then,	999
	Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;	999
	No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.	999
	The door is open, sir; there lies your way;	999
	You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;	999
	For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:	999
	'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,	999
	That take it on you at the first so roundly.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.	999
	999
KATHARINA	I will be angry: what hast thou to do?	999
	Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.	999
	999
GREMIO	Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.	999
	999
KATARINA	Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:	999
	I see a woman may be made a fool,	999
	If she had not a spirit to resist.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.	999
	Obey the bride, you that attend on her;	999
	Go to the feast, revel and domineer,	999
	Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,	999
	Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:	999
	But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.	999
	Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;	999
	I will be master of what is mine own:	999
	She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,	999
	My household stuff, my field, my barn,	999
	My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;	999
	And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;	999
	I'll bring mine action on the proudest he	999
	That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,	999
	Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;	999
	Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.	999
	Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch	999
	thee, Kate:	999
	I'll buckler thee against a million.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, and GRUMIO]	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.	999
	999
GREMIO	Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.	999
	999
TRANIO	Of all mad matches never was the like.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?	999
	999
BIANCA	That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.	999
	999
GREMIO	I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Neighbours and friends, though bride and	999
	bridegroom wants	999
	For to supply the places at the table,	999
	You know there wants no junkets at the feast.	999
	Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place:	999
	And let Bianca take her sister's room.	999
	999
TRANIO	Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?	999
	999
BAPTISTA	She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.	999

	THE TAMING OF THE SHREW	999
	999
	999
ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	PETRUCHIO'S country house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter GRUMIO]	999
	999
GRUMIO	Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and	999
	all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever	999
	man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent	999
	before to make a fire, and they are coming after to	999
	warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon	999
	hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my	999
	tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my	999
	belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but	999
	I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,	999
	considering the weather, a taller man than I will	999
	take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.	999
	999
	[Enter CURTIS]	999
	999
CURTIS	Who is that calls so coldly?	999
	999
GRUMIO	A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide	999
	from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run	999
	but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.	999
	999
CURTIS	Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?	999
	999
GRUMIO	O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast	999
	on no water.	999
	999
CURTIS	Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?	999
	999
GRUMIO	She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou	999
	knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it	999
	hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and	999
	myself, fellow Curtis.	999
	999
CURTIS	Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and	999
	so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a	999
	fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,	999
	whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon	999
	feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?	999
	999
CURTIS	I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?	999
	999
GRUMIO	A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and	999
	therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for	999
	my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.	999
	999
CURTIS	There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as	999
	will thaw.	999
	999
CURTIS	Come, you are so full of cony-catching!	999
	999
GRUMIO	Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.	999
	Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house	999
	trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the	999
	serving-men in their new fustian, their white	999
	stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?	999
	Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,	999
	the carpets laid, and every thing in order?	999
	999
CURTIS	All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.	999
	999
GRUMIO	First, know, my horse is tired; my master and	999
	mistress fallen out.	999
	999
CURTIS	How?	999
	999
GRUMIO	Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby	999
	hangs a tale.	999
	999
CURTIS	Let's ha't, good Grumio.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Lend thine ear.	999
	999
CURTIS	Here.	999
	999
GRUMIO	There.	999
	999
	[Strikes him]	999
	999
CURTIS	This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.	999
	999
GRUMIO	And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this	999
	cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech	999
	listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a	999
	foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--	999
	999
CURTIS	Both of one horse?	999
	999
GRUMIO	What's that to thee?	999
	999
CURTIS	Why, a horse.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,	999
	thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she	999
	under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how	999
	miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her	999
	with the horse upon her, how he beat me because	999
	her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt	999
	to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,	999
	that never prayed before, how I cried, how the	999
	horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I	999
	lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,	999
	which now shall die in oblivion and thou return	999
	unexperienced to thy grave.	999
	999
CURTIS	By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall	999
	find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?	999
	Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,	999
	Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be	999
	sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their	999
	garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy	999
	with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair	999
	of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their	999
	hands. Are they all ready?	999
	999
CURTIS	They are.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Call them forth.	999
	999
CURTIS	Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to	999
	countenance my mistress.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Why, she hath a face of her own.	999
	999
CURTIS	Who knows not that?	999
	999
GRUMIO	Thou, it seems, that calls for company to	999
	countenance her.	999
	999
CURTIS	I call them forth to credit her.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.	999
	999
	[Enter four or five Serving-men]	999
	999
NATHANIEL	Welcome home, Grumio!	999
	999

	999
JOSEPH	What, Grumio!	999
	999
NICHOLAS	Fellow Grumio!	999
	999
NATHANIEL	How now, old lad?	999
	999
GRUMIO	Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,	999
	you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce	999
	companions, is all ready, and all things neat?	999
	999
NATHANIEL	All things is ready. How near is our master?	999
	999
GRUMIO	E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be	999
	not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.	999
	999
	[Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA]	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Where be these knaves? What, no man at door	999
	To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!	999
	Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?	999
	999
ALL SERVING-MEN	Here, here, sir; here, sir.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!	999
	You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!	999
	What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?	999
	Where is the foolish knave I sent before?	999
	999
GRUMIO	Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!	999
	Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,	999
	And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?	999
	999
GRUMIO	Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,	999
	And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;	999
	There was no link to colour Peter's hat,	999
	And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:	999
	There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;	999
	The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;	999
	Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Servants]	999
	999
	[Singing]	999
	999
	Where is the life that late I led--	999
	Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--	999
	Sound, sound, sound, sound!	999
	999
	[Re-enter Servants with supper]	999
	999
	Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.	999
	Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	It was the friar of orders grey,	999
	As he forth walked on his way:--	999
	Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:	999
	Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.	999
	999
	[Strikes him]	999
	999
	Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!	999
	Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,	999
	And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:	999
	One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.	999
	Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?	999
	999
	[Enter one with water]	999
	999
	Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.	999
	You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?	999
	999
	[Strikes him]	999
	999
KATHARINA	Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!	999
	Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.	999
	Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?	999
	What's this? mutton?	999
	999
First Servant	Ay.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Who brought it?	999
	999
PETER	I.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.	999
	What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?	999
	How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,	999
	And serve it thus to me that love it not?	999
	Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;	999
	999
	[Throws the meat, &c. about the stage]	999
	999
	You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!	999
	What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.	999
	999
KATHARINA	I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:	999
	The meat was well, if you were so contented.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;	999
	And I expressly am forbid to touch it,	999
	For it engenders choler, planteth anger;	999
	And better 'twere that both of us did fast,	999
	Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,	999
	Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.	999
	Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,	999
	And, for this night, we'll fast for company:	999
	Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Re-enter Servants severally]	999
	999
NATHANIEL	Peter, didst ever see the like?	999
	999
PETER	He kills her in her own humour.	999
	999
	[Re-enter CURTIS]	999
	999
GRUMIO	Where is he?	999
	999
CURTIS	In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;	999
	And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,	999
	Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,	999
	And sits as one new-risen from a dream.	999
	Away, away! for he is coming hither.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Re-enter PETRUCHIO]	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Thus have I politicly begun my reign,	999
	And 'tis my hope to end successfully.	999
	My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;	999
	And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,	999
	For then she never looks upon her lure.	999
	Another way I have to man my haggard,	999
	To make her come and know her keeper's call,	999
	That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites	999
	That bate and beat and will not be obedient.	999
	She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;	999
	Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;	999
	As with the meat, some undeserved fault	999
	I'll find about the making of the bed;	999
	And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,	999
	This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:	999
	Ay, and amid this hurly I intend	999
	That all is done in reverend care of her;	999
	And in conclusion she shall watch all night:	999
	And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl	999
	And with the clamour keep her still awake.	999
	This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;	999
	And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.	999
	He that knows better how to tame a shrew,	999
	Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.	999

SCENE II	Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter TRANIO and HORTENSIO]	999
	999
TRANIO	Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca	999
	Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?	999
	I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,	999
	Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.	999
	999
	[Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO]	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?	999
	999
BIANCA	What, master, read you? first resolve me that.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	I read that I profess, the Art to Love.	999
	999
BIANCA	And may you prove, sir, master of your art!	999
	999
LUCENTIO	While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,	999
	You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca	999
	Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.	999
	999
TRANIO	O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!	999
	I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Mistake no more: I am not Licio,	999
	Nor a musician, as I seem to be;	999
	But one that scorn to live in this disguise,	999
	For such a one as leaves a gentleman,	999
	And makes a god of such a cullion:	999
	Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.	999
	999
TRANIO	Signior Hortensio, I have often heard	999
	Of your entire affection to Bianca;	999
	And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,	999
	I will with you, if you be so contented,	999
	Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,	999
	Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow	999
	Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,	999
	As one unworthy all the former favours	999
	That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.	999
	999
TRANIO	And here I take the unfeigned oath,	999
	Never to marry with her though she would entreat:	999
	Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!	999
	For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,	999
	I will be married to a wealthy widow,	999
	Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me	999
	As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.	999
	And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.	999
	Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,	999
	Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,	999
	In resolution as I swore before.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
TRANIO	Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace	999
	As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!	999
	Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,	999
	And have forsworn you with Hortensio.	999
	999
BIANCA	Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?	999
	999
TRANIO	Mistress, we have.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	                  Then we are rid of Licio.	999
	999
TRANIO	I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,	999
	That shall be wood and wedded in a day.	999
	999
BIANCA	God give him joy!	999
	999
TRANIO	Ay, and he'll tame her.	999
	999
BIANCA	He says so, Tranio.	999
	999
TRANIO	Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.	999
	999
BIANCA	The taming-school! what, is there such a place?	999
	999
TRANIO	Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;	999
	That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,	999
	To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.	999
	999
	[Enter BIONDELLO]	999
	999
BIONDELLO	O master, master, I have watch'd so long	999
	That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied	999
	An ancient angel coming down the hill,	999
	Will serve the turn.	999
	999
TRANIO	What is he, Biondello?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,	999
	I know not what; but format in apparel,	999
	In gait and countenance surely like a father.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	And what of him, Tranio?	999
	999
TRANIO	If he be credulous and trust my tale,	999
	I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,	999
	And give assurance to Baptista Minola,	999
	As if he were the right Vincentio	999
	Take in your love, and then let me alone.	999
	999
	[Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA]	999
	999
	[Enter a Pedant]	999
	999
Pedant	God save you, sir!	999
	999
TRANIO	                  And you, sir! you are welcome.	999
	Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?	999
	999
Pedant	Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:	999
	But then up farther, and as for as Rome;	999
	And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.	999
	999
TRANIO	What countryman, I pray?	999
	999
Pedant	Of Mantua.	999
	999
TRANIO	Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!	999
	And come to Padua, careless of your life?	999
	999
Pedant	My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.	999
	999
TRANIO	'Tis death for any one in Mantua	999
	To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?	999
	Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,	999
	For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,	999
	Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:	999
	'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,	999
	You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.	999
	999
Pedant	Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;	999
	For I have bills for money by exchange	999
	From Florence and must here deliver them.	999
	999
TRANIO	Well, sir, to do you courtesy,	999
	This will I do, and this I will advise you:	999
	First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?	999
Pedant	Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,	999
	Pisa renowned for grave citizens.	999
	999
TRANIO	Among them know you one Vincentio?	999
	999
Pedant	I know him not, but I have heard of him;	999
	A merchant of incomparable wealth.	999
	999
TRANIO	He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,	999
	In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.	999
	999
BIONDELLO	[Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster,	999
	and all one.	999
	999
TRANIO	To save your life in this extremity,	999
	This favour will I do you for his sake;	999
	And think it not the worst of an your fortunes	999
	That you are like to Sir Vincentio.	999
	His name and credit shall you undertake,	999
	And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:	999
	Look that you take upon you as you should;	999
	You understand me, sir: so shall you stay	999
	Till you have done your business in the city:	999
	If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.	999
	999
Pedant	O sir, I do; and will repute you ever	999
	The patron of my life and liberty.	999
	999
TRANIO	Then go with me to make the matter good.	999
	This, by the way, I let you understand;	999
	my father is here look'd for every day,	999
	To pass assurance of a dower in marriage	999
	'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:	999
	In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:	999
	Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.	999

SCENE III	A room in PETRUCHIO'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KATHARINA and GRUMIO]	999
	999
GRUMIO	No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.	999
	999
KATHARINA	The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:	999
	What, did he marry me to famish me?	999
	Beggars, that come unto my father's door,	999
	Upon entreaty have a present aims;	999
	If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:	999
	But I, who never knew how to entreat,	999
	Nor never needed that I should entreat,	999
	Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,	999
	With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:	999
	And that which spites me more than all these wants,	999
	He does it under name of perfect love;	999
	As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,	999
	'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.	999
	I prithee go and get me some repast;	999
	I care not what, so it be wholesome food.	999
	999
GRUMIO	What say you to a neat's foot?	999
	999
KATHARINA	'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.	999
	999
GRUMIO	I fear it is too choleric a meat.	999
	How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?	999
	999
KATHARINA	I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.	999
	999
GRUMIO	I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.	999
	What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?	999
	999
KATHARINA	A dish that I do love to feed upon.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,	999
	Or else you get no beef of Grumio.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Why then, the mustard without the beef.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,	999
	999
	[Beats him]	999
	999
	That feed'st me with the very name of meat:	999
	Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,	999
	That triumph thus upon my misery!	999
	Go, get thee gone, I say.	999
	999
	[Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat]	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Mistress, what cheer?	999
	999
KATHARINA	Faith, as cold as can be.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.	999
	Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am	999
	To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:	999
	I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.	999
	What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;	999
	And all my pains is sorted to no proof.	999
	Here, take away this dish.	999
	999
KATHARINA	I pray you, let it stand.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	The poorest service is repaid with thanks;	999
	And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.	999
	999
KATHARINA	I thank you, sir.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.	999
	Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	[Aside]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.	999
	Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!	999
	Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love,	999
	Will we return unto thy father's house	999
	And revel it as bravely as the best,	999
	With silken coats and caps and golden rings,	999
	With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things;	999
	With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,	999
	With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery.	999
	What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,	999
	To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.	999
	999
	[Enter Tailor]	999
	999
	Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;	999
	Lay forth the gown.	999
	999
	[Enter Haberdasher]	999
	999
	What news with you, sir?	999
	999
Haberdasher	Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Why, this was moulded on a porringer;	999
	A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:	999
	Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,	999
	A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:	999
	Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.	999
	999
KATHARINA	I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,	999
	And gentlewomen wear such caps as these	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	When you are gentle, you shall have one too,	999
	And not till then.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	[Aside]  That will not be in haste.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;	999
	And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:	999
	Your betters have endured me say my mind,	999
	And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.	999
	My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,	999
	Or else my heart concealing it will break,	999
	And rather than it shall, I will be free	999
	Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,	999
	A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:	999
	I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Love me or love me not, I like the cap;	999
	And it I will have, or I will have none.	999
	999
	[Exit Haberdasher]	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.	999
	O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?	999
	What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:	999
	What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?	999
	Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,	999
	Like to a censer in a barber's shop:	999
	Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	[Aside]  I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.	999
	999
Tailor	You bid me make it orderly and well,	999
	According to the fashion and the time.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,	999
	I did not bid you mar it to the time.	999
	Go, hop me over every kennel home,	999
	For you shall hop without my custom, sir:	999
	I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.	999
	999
KATHARINA	I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,	999
	More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:	999
	Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.	999
	999
Tailor	She says your worship means to make	999
	a puppet of her.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,	999
	thou thimble,	999
	Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!	999
	Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!	999
	Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?	999
	Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;	999
	Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard	999
	As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!	999
	I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.	999
	999
Tailor	Your worship is deceived; the gown is made	999
	Just as my master had direction:	999
	Grumio gave order how it should be done.	999
	999
GRUMIO	I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.	999
	999
Tailor	But how did you desire it should be made?	999
	999
GRUMIO	Marry, sir, with needle and thread.	999
	999
Tailor	But did you not request to have it cut?	999
	999
GRUMIO	Thou hast faced many things.	999
	999
Tailor	I have.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not	999
	me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto	999
	thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did	999
	not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.	999
	999
Tailor	Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Read it.	999
	999
GRUMIO	The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.	999
	999
Tailor	[Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown:'	999
	999
GRUMIO	Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in	999
	the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom	999
	of brown thread: I said a gown.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Proceed.	999
	999
Tailor	[Reads]  'With a small compassed cape:'	999
	999
GRUMIO	I confess the cape.	999
	999
Tailor	[Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve:'	999
	999
GRUMIO	I confess two sleeves.	999
	999
Tailor	[Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.'	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Ay, there's the villany.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.	999
	I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and	999
	sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,	999
	though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.	999
	999
Tailor	This is true that I say: an I had thee	999
	in place where, thou shouldst know it.	999
	999
GRUMIO	I am for thee straight: take thou the	999
	bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.	999
	999
GRUMIO	You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Go, take it up unto thy master's use.	999
	999
GRUMIO	Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'	999
	gown for thy master's use!	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?	999
	999
GRUMIO	O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:	999
	Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!	999
	O, fie, fie, fie!	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	[Aside]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.	999
	Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:	999
	Take no unkindness of his hasty words:	999
	Away! I say; commend me to thy master.	999
	999
	[Exit Tailor]	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's	999
	Even in these honest mean habiliments:	999
	Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;	999
	For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;	999
	And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,	999
	So honour peereth in the meanest habit.	999
	What is the jay more precious than the lark,	999
	Because his fathers are more beautiful?	999
	Or is the adder better than the eel,	999
	Because his painted skin contents the eye?	999
	O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse	999
	For this poor furniture and mean array.	999
	if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me;	999
	And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,	999
	To feast and sport us at thy father's house.	999
	Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;	999
	And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;	999
	There will we mount, and thither walk on foot	999
	Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,	999
	And well we may come there by dinner-time.	999
	999
KATHARINA	I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;	999
	And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	It shall be seven ere I go to horse:	999
	Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,	999
	You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:	999
	I will not go to-day; and ere I do,	999
	It shall be what o'clock I say it is.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	[Aside]  Why, so this gallant will command the sun.	999

SCENE IV	Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter TRANIO, and the Pedant dressed like VINCENTIO]	999
	999
TRANIO	Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?	999
	999
Pedant	Ay, what else? and but I be deceived	999
	Signior Baptista may remember me,	999
	Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,	999
	Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.	999
	999
TRANIO	'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,	999
	With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.	999
	999
Pedant	I warrant you.	999
	999
	[Enter BIONDELLO]	999
	999
	But, sir, here comes your boy;	999
	'Twere good he were school'd.	999
	999
TRANIO	Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,	999
	Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:	999
	Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Tut, fear not me.	999
	999
TRANIO	But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	I told him that your father was at Venice,	999
	And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.	999
	999
TRANIO	Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.	999
	Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.	999
	999
	[Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO]	999
	999
	Signior Baptista, you are happily met.	999
	999
	[To the Pedant]	999
	999
	Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:	999
	I pray you stand good father to me now,	999
	Give me Bianca for my patrimony.	999
	999
Pedant	Soft son!	999
	Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua	999
	To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio	999
	Made me acquainted with a weighty cause	999
	Of love between your daughter and himself:	999
	And, for the good report I hear of you	999
	And for the love he beareth to your daughter	999
	And she to him, to stay him not too long,	999
	I am content, in a good father's care,	999
	To have him match'd; and if you please to like	999
	No worse than I, upon some agreement	999
	Me shall you find ready and willing	999
	With one consent to have her so bestow'd;	999
	For curious I cannot be with you,	999
	Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:	999
	Your plainness and your shortness please me well.	999
	Right true it is, your son Lucentio here	999
	Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,	999
	Or both dissemble deeply their affections:	999
	And therefore, if you say no more than this,	999
	That like a father you will deal with him	999
	And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,	999
	The match is made, and all is done:	999
	Your son shall have my daughter with consent.	999
	999
TRANIO	I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best	999
	We be affied and such assurance ta'en	999
	As shall with either part's agreement stand?	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,	999
	Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:	999
	Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;	999
	And happily we might be interrupted.	999
	999
TRANIO	Then at my lodging, an it like you:	999
	There doth my father lie; and there, this night,	999
	We'll pass the business privately and well.	999
	Send for your daughter by your servant here:	999
	My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.	999
	The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,	999
	You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,	999
	And bid Bianca make her ready straight;	999
	And, if you will, tell what hath happened,	999
	Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,	999
	And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.	999
	999
BIONDELLO	I pray the gods she may with all my heart!	999
	999
TRANIO	Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.	999
	999
	[Exit BIONDELLO]	999
	999
	Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?	999
	Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:	999
	Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	I follow you.	999
	999
	[Exeunt TRANIO, Pedant, and BAPTISTA]	999
	999
	[Re-enter BIONDELLO]	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Cambio!	999
	999
LUCENTIO	What sayest thou, Biondello?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Biondello, what of that?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to	999
	expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	I pray thee, moralize them.	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the	999
	deceiving father of a deceitful son.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	And what of him?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	And then?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your	999
	command at all hours.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	And what of all this?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a	999
	counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,	999
	'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the	999
	church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient	999
	honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,	999
	I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for	999
	ever and a day.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Hearest thou, Biondello?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an	999
	afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to	999
	stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,	999
	sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint	999
	Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against	999
	you come with your appendix.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LUCENTIO	I may, and will, if she be so contented:	999
	She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?	999
	Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:	999
	It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.	999

	[Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Servants]	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.	999
	Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!	999
	999
KATHARINA	The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	I say it is the moon that shines so bright.	999
	999
KATHARINA	I know it is the sun that shines so bright.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,	999
	It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,	999
	Or ere I journey to your father's house.	999
	Go on, and fetch our horses back again.	999
	Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Say as he says, or we shall never go.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,	999
	And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:	999
	An if you please to call it a rush-candle,	999
	Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	I say it is the moon.	999
	999
KATHARINA	I know it is the moon.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:	999
	But sun it is not, when you say it is not;	999
	And the moon changes even as your mind.	999
	What you will have it named, even that it is;	999
	And so it shall be so for Katharina.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,	999
	And not unluckily against the bias.	999
	But, soft! company is coming here.	999
	999
	[Enter VINCENTIO]	999
	999
	[To VINCENTIO]	999
	999
	Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?	999
	Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,	999
	Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?	999
	Such war of white and red within her cheeks!	999
	What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,	999
	As those two eyes become that heavenly face?	999
	Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.	999
	Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,	999
	Whither away, or where is thy abode?	999
	Happy the parents of so fair a child;	999
	Happier the man, whom favourable stars	999
	Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:	999
	This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,	999
	And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,	999
	That have been so bedazzled with the sun	999
	That everything I look on seemeth green:	999
	Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;	999
	Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known	999
	Which way thou travellest: if along with us,	999
	We shall be joyful of thy company.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,	999
	That with your strange encounter much amazed me,	999
	My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;	999
	And bound I am to Padua; there to visit	999
	A son of mine, which long I have not seen.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	What is his name?	999
	999
VINCENTIO	                  Lucentio, gentle sir.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Happily we met; the happier for thy son.	999
	And now by law, as well as reverend age,	999
	I may entitle thee my loving father:	999
	The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,	999
	Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,	999
	Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,	999
	Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;	999
	Beside, so qualified as may beseem	999
	The spouse of any noble gentleman.	999
	Let me embrace with old Vincentio,	999
	And wander we to see thy honest son,	999
	Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,	999
	Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest	999
	Upon the company you overtake?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	I do assure thee, father, so it is.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;	999
	For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but HORTENSIO]	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.	999

BIONDELLO	Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee	999
	at home; therefore leave us.	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and	999
	then come back to my master's as soon as I can.	999

	with Attendants]	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:	999
	My father's bears more toward the market-place;	999
	Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	You shall not choose but drink before you go:	999
	I think I shall command your welcome here,	999
	And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.	999
	999
	[Knocks]	999
	999
GREMIO	They're busy within; you were best knock louder.	999
	999
	[Pedant looks out of the window]	999
	999
Pedant	What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?	999
	999
VINCENTIO	Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?	999
	999
Pedant	He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to	999
	make merry withal?	999
	999
Pedant	Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall	999
	need none, so long as I live.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.	999
	Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,	999
	I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is	999
	come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.	999
	999
Pedant	Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here	999
	looking out at the window.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	Art thou his father?	999
	999
Pedant	Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	[To VINCENTIO]  Why, how now, gentleman! why, this	999
	is flat knavery, to take upon you another man's name.	999
	999
Pedant	Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to	999
	cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BIONDELLO]	999
	999
BIONDELLO	I have seen them in the church together: God send	999
	'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old	999
	master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	[Seeing BIONDELLO]	999
	999
	Come hither, crack-hemp.	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Hope I may choose, sir.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I	999
	never saw you before in all my life.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see	999
	thy master's father, Vincentio?	999

TRANIO	Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?	999
	999
VINCENTIO	What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal	999
	gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet	999
	hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I	999
	am undone! I am undone! while I play the good	999
	husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at	999

	999
BAPTISTA	What, is the man lunatic?	999
	999
TRANIO	Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your	999
	habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,	999
	what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I	999
	thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do	999
	you think is his name?	999
	999
VINCENTIO	His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought	999
	him up ever since he was three years old, and his	999
	name is Tranio.	999
	999
Pedant	Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is	999
	mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold	999
	on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my	999
	son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?	999
	999

	999
	[Enter one with an Officer]	999

	Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,	999
	I charge you see that he be forthcoming.	999

	999
GREMIO	Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.	999
	999
GREMIO	Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be	999
	cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this	999
	is the right Vincentio.	999
	999
Pedant	Swear, if thou darest.	999
	999
GREMIO	Nay, I dare not swear it.	999
	999
TRANIO	Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.	999
	999
GREMIO	Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!	999
	999
VINCENTIO	Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O	999
	monstrous villain!	999
	999
	[Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA]	999
	999
BIONDELLO	O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,	999
	forswear him, or else we are all undone.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	[Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	Lives my sweet son?	999
	999
	[Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and Pedant, as fast	999
	as may be]	999
	999
BIANCA	Pardon, dear father.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	How hast thou offended?	999
	Where is Lucentio?	999
	999
LUCENTIO	                  Here's Lucentio,	999
	Right son to the right Vincentio;	999
	That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,	999
	While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.	999
	999
GREMIO	Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!	999
	999
VINCENTIO	Where is that damned villain Tranio,	999
	That faced and braved me in this matter so?	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?	999
	999
BIANCA	Cambio is changed into Lucentio.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love	999
	Made me exchange my state with Tranio,	999
	While he did bear my countenance in the town;	999
	And happily I have arrived at the last	999
	Unto the wished haven of my bliss.	999
	What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;	999
	Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent	999
	me to the gaol.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter	999
	without asking my good will?	999
	999
VINCENTIO	Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but	999
	I will in, to be revenged for this villany.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BAPTISTA	And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.	999
	999
	[Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA]	999
	999
GREMIO	My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,	999
	Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KATHARINA	Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	First kiss me, Kate, and we will.	999
	999
KATHARINA	What, in the midst of the street?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	What, art thou ashamed of me?	999
	999
KATHARINA	No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:	999
	Better once than never, for never too late.	999

SCENE II	Padua. LUCENTIO'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the Pedant,	999
	LUCENTIO, BIANCA, PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO,	999
	and Widow, TRANIO, BIONDELLO, and GRUMIO the	999
	Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet]	999
	999
LUCENTIO	At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:	999
	And time it is, when raging war is done,	999
	To smile at scapes and perils overblown.	999
	My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,	999
	While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.	999
	Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,	999
	And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,	999
	Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:	999
	My banquet is to close our stomachs up,	999
	After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;	999
	For now we sit to chat as well as eat.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Padua affords nothing but what is kind.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	For both our sakes, I would that word were true.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.	999
	999
Widow	Then never trust me, if I be afeard.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:	999
	I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.	999
	999
Widow	He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Roundly replied.	999
	999
KATHARINA	                  Mistress, how mean you that?	999
	999
Widow	Thus I conceive by him.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.	999
	999
KATHARINA	'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'	999
	I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.	999
	999
Widow	Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,	999
	Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:	999
	And now you know my meaning,	999
	999
KATHARINA	A very mean meaning.	999
	999
Widow	Right, I mean you.	999
	999
KATHARINA	And I am mean indeed, respecting you.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	To her, Kate!	999
	999
HORTENSIO	To her, widow!	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	That's my office.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!	999
	999
	[Drinks to HORTENSIO]	999
	999
BAPTISTA	How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?	999
	999
GREMIO	Believe me, sir, they butt together well.	999
	999
BIANCA	Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body	999
	Would say your head and butt were head and horn.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?	999
	999
BIANCA	Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,	999
	Have at you for a bitter jest or two!	999
	999
BIANCA	Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;	999
	And then pursue me as you draw your bow.	999
	You are welcome all.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow]	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.	999
	This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;	999
	Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.	999
	999
TRANIO	O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,	999
	Which runs himself and catches for his master.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	A good swift simile, but something currish.	999
	999
TRANIO	'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:	999
	'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;	999
	And, as the jest did glance away from me,	999
	'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,	999
	I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance	999
	Let's each one send unto his wife;	999
	And he whose wife is most obedient	999
	To come at first when he doth send for her,	999
	Shall win the wager which we will propose.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Content. What is the wager?	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Twenty crowns.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Twenty crowns!	999
	I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,	999
	But twenty times so much upon my wife.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	A hundred then.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	                  Content.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	A match! 'tis done.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Who shall begin?	999
	999
LUCENTIO	                  That will I.	999
	Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.	999
	999
BIONDELLO	I go.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BIONDELLO]	999
	999
	How now! what news?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	Sir, my mistress sends you word	999
	That she is busy and she cannot come.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	How! she is busy and she cannot come!	999
	Is that an answer?	999
	999
GREMIO	                  Ay, and a kind one too:	999
	Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	I hope better.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife	999
	To come to me forthwith.	999
	999
	[Exit BIONDELLO]	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	O, ho! entreat her!	999
	Nay, then she must needs come.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	I am afraid, sir,	999
	Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BIONDELLO]	999
	999
	Now, where's my wife?	999
	999
BIONDELLO	She says you have some goodly jest in hand:	999
	She will not come: she bids you come to her.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,	999
	Intolerable, not to be endured!	999
	Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;	999
	Say, I command her to come to me.	999
	999
	[Exit GRUMIO]	999
	999
HORTENSIO	I know her answer.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	                  What?	999
	999
HORTENSIO	She will not.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!	999
	999
	[Re-enter KATARINA]	999
	999
KATHARINA	What is your will, sir, that you send for me?	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?	999
	999
KATHARINA	They sit conferring by the parlor fire.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.	999
	Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:	999
	Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.	999
	999
	[Exit KATHARINA]	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.	999
	999
HORTENSIO	And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,	999
	And awful rule and right supremacy;	999
	And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?	999
	999
BAPTISTA	Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!	999
	The wager thou hast won; and I will add	999
	Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;	999
	Another dowry to another daughter,	999
	For she is changed, as she had never been.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Nay, I will win my wager better yet	999
	And show more sign of her obedience,	999
	Her new-built virtue and obedience.	999
	See where she comes and brings your froward wives	999
	As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.	999
	999
	[Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow]	999
	999
	Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:	999
	Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.	999
	999
Widow	Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,	999
	Till I be brought to such a silly pass!	999
	999
BIANCA	Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?	999
	999
LUCENTIO	I would your duty were as foolish too:	999
	The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,	999
	Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.	999
	999
BIANCA	The more fool you, for laying on my duty.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women	999
	What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.	999
	999
Widow	Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Come on, I say; and first begin with her.	999
	999
Widow	She shall not.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	I say she shall: and first begin with her.	999
	999
KATHARINA	Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,	999
	And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,	999
	To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:	999
	It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,	999
	Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,	999
	And in no sense is meet or amiable.	999
	A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,	999
	Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;	999
	And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty	999
	Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.	999
	Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,	999
	Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,	999
	And for thy maintenance commits his body	999
	To painful labour both by sea and land,	999
	To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,	999
	Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;	999
	And craves no other tribute at thy hands	999
	But love, fair looks and true obedience;	999
	Too little payment for so great a debt.	999
	Such duty as the subject owes the prince	999
	Even such a woman oweth to her husband;	999
	And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,	999
	And not obedient to his honest will,	999
	What is she but a foul contending rebel	999
	And graceless traitor to her loving lord?	999
	I am ashamed that women are so simple	999
	To offer war where they should kneel for peace;	999
	Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,	999
	When they are bound to serve, love and obey.	999
	Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,	999
	Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,	999
	But that our soft conditions and our hearts	999
	Should well agree with our external parts?	999
	Come, come, you froward and unable worms!	999
	My mind hath been as big as one of yours,	999
	My heart as great, my reason haply more,	999
	To bandy word for word and frown for frown;	999
	But now I see our lances are but straws,	999
	Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,	999
	That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.	999
	Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,	999
	And place your hands below your husband's foot:	999
	In token of which duty, if he please,	999
	My hand is ready; may it do him ease.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.	999
	999
VINCENTIO	'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	But a harsh hearing when women are froward.	999
	999
PETRUCHIO	Come, Kate, we'll to bed.	999
	We three are married, but you two are sped.	999
	999
	[To LUCENTIO]	999
	999
	'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;	999
	And, being a winner, God give you good night!	999
	999
	[Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA]	999
	999
HORTENSIO	Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.	999
	999
LUCENTIO	'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.	999

	[Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO]	999
	999
	Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er	999
	and drown? Have you a mind to sink?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,	999
	incharitable dog!	999
	999
Boatswain	Work you then.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!	999
	We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.	999
	999
GONZALO	I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were	999
	no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an	999
	unstanched wench.	999
	999
Boatswain	Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to	999
	sea again; lay her off.	999
	999
	[Enter Mariners wet]	999
	999
Mariners	All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!	999
	999
Boatswain	What, must our mouths be cold?	999
	999
GONZALO	The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,	999
	For our case is as theirs.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	I'm out of patience.	999
	999
ANTONIO	We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:	999
	This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning	999
	The washing of ten tides!	999
	999
GONZALO	He'll be hang'd yet,	999
	Though every drop of water swear against it	999
	And gape at widest to glut him.	999
	999
	[A confused noise within:   'Mercy on us!'--	999
	'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and	999
	children!'--	999
	'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!']	999
	999
ANTONIO	Let's all sink with the king.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Let's take leave of him.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN]	999
	999
GONZALO	Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an	999
	acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any	999
	thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain	999
	die a dry death.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

	THE TEMPEST	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA]	999
	999
MIRANDA	If by your art, my dearest father, you have	999
	Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.	999
	The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,	999
	But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,	999
	Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered	999
	With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,	999
	Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,	999
	Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock	999
	Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.	999
	Had I been any god of power, I would	999
	Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere	999
	It should the good ship so have swallow'd and	999
	The fraughting souls within her.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Be collected:	999
	No more amazement: tell your piteous heart	999
	There's no harm done.	999
	999
MIRANDA	O, woe the day!	999
	999
PROSPERO	No harm.	999
	I have done nothing but in care of thee,	999
	Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who	999
	Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing	999
	Of whence I am, nor that I am more better	999
	Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,	999
	And thy no greater father.	999
	999
MIRANDA	More to know	999
	Did never meddle with my thoughts.	999
	999
PROSPERO	'Tis time	999
	I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,	999
	And pluck my magic garment from me. So:	999
	999
	[Lays down his mantle]	999
	999
	Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.	999
	The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd	999
	The very virtue of compassion in thee,	999
	I have with such provision in mine art	999
	So safely ordered that there is no soul--	999
	No, not so much perdition as an hair	999
	Betid to any creature in the vessel	999
	Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;	999
	For thou must now know farther.	999
	999
MIRANDA	You have often	999
	Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd	999
	And left me to a bootless inquisition,	999
	Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'	999
	999
PROSPERO	The hour's now come;	999
	The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;	999
	Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember	999
	A time before we came unto this cell?	999
	I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not	999
	Out three years old.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Certainly, sir, I can.	999
	999
PROSPERO	By what? by any other house or person?	999
	Of any thing the image tell me that	999
	Hath kept with thy remembrance.	999
	999
MIRANDA	'Tis far off	999
	And rather like a dream than an assurance	999
	That my remembrance warrants. Had I not	999
	Four or five women once that tended me?	999
	999
PROSPERO	Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it	999
	That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else	999
	In the dark backward and abysm of time?	999
	If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,	999
	How thou camest here thou mayst.	999
	999
MIRANDA	But that I do not.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,	999
	Thy father was the Duke of Milan and	999
	A prince of power.	999
	999
MIRANDA	                  Sir, are not you my father?	999
	999
PROSPERO	Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and	999
	She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father	999
	Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir	999
	And princess no worse issued.	999
	999
MIRANDA	O the heavens!	999
	What foul play had we, that we came from thence?	999
	Or blessed was't we did?	999
	999
PROSPERO	Both, both, my girl:	999
	By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,	999
	But blessedly holp hither.	999
	999
MIRANDA	O, my heart bleeds	999
	To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,	999
	Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.	999
	999
PROSPERO	My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--	999
	I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should	999
	Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself	999
	Of all the world I loved and to him put	999
	The manage of my state; as at that time	999
	Through all the signories it was the first	999
	And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed	999
	In dignity, and for the liberal arts	999
	Without a parallel; those being all my study,	999
	The government I cast upon my brother	999
	And to my state grew stranger, being transported	999
	And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--	999
	Dost thou attend me?	999
	999
MIRANDA	Sir, most heedfully.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Being once perfected how to grant suits,	999
	How to deny them, who to advance and who	999
	To trash for over-topping, new created	999
	The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,	999
	Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key	999
	Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state	999
	To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was	999
	The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,	999
	And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.	999
	999
MIRANDA	O, good sir, I do.	999
	999
PROSPERO	                  I pray thee, mark me.	999
	I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated	999
	To closeness and the bettering of my mind	999
	With that which, but by being so retired,	999
	O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother	999
	Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,	999
	Like a good parent, did beget of him	999
	A falsehood in its contrary as great	999
	As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,	999
	A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,	999
	Not only with what my revenue yielded,	999
	But what my power might else exact, like one	999
	Who having into truth, by telling of it,	999
	Made such a sinner of his memory,	999
	To credit his own lie, he did believe	999
	He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution	999
	And executing the outward face of royalty,	999
	With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--	999
	Dost thou hear?	999
	999
MIRANDA	                  Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.	999
	999
PROSPERO	To have no screen between this part he play'd	999
	And him he play'd it for, he needs will be	999
	Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library	999
	Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties	999
	He thinks me now incapable; confederates--	999
	So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples	999
	To give him annual tribute, do him homage,	999
	Subject his coronet to his crown and bend	999
	The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--	999
	To most ignoble stooping.	999
	999
MIRANDA	O the heavens!	999
	999
PROSPERO	Mark his condition and the event; then tell me	999
	If this might be a brother.	999
	999
MIRANDA	I should sin	999
	To think but nobly of my grandmother:	999
	Good wombs have borne bad sons.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Now the condition.	999
	The King of Naples, being an enemy	999
	To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;	999
	Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises	999
	Of homage and I know not how much tribute,	999
	Should presently extirpate me and mine	999
	Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan	999
	With all the honours on my brother: whereon,	999
	A treacherous army levied, one midnight	999
	Fated to the purpose did Antonio open	999
	The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,	999
	The ministers for the purpose hurried thence	999
	Me and thy crying self.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Alack, for pity!	999
	I, not remembering how I cried out then,	999
	Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint	999
	That wrings mine eyes to't.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Hear a little further	999
	And then I'll bring thee to the present business	999
	Which now's upon's; without the which this story	999
	Were most impertinent.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Wherefore did they not	999
	That hour destroy us?	999
	999
PROSPERO	Well demanded, wench:	999
	My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,	999
	So dear the love my people bore me, nor set	999
	A mark so bloody on the business, but	999
	With colours fairer painted their foul ends.	999
	In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,	999
	Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared	999
	A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,	999
	Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats	999
	Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,	999
	To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh	999
	To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,	999
	Did us but loving wrong.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Alack, what trouble	999
	Was I then to you!	999
	999
PROSPERO	                  O, a cherubim	999
	Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.	999
	Infused with a fortitude from heaven,	999
	When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,	999
	Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me	999
	An undergoing stomach, to bear up	999
	Against what should ensue.	999
	999
MIRANDA	How came we ashore?	999
	999
PROSPERO	By Providence divine.	999
	Some food we had and some fresh water that	999
	A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,	999
	Out of his charity, being then appointed	999
	Master of this design, did give us, with	999
	Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,	999
	Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,	999
	Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me	999
	From mine own library with volumes that	999
	I prize above my dukedom.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Would I might	999
	But ever see that man!	999
	999
PROSPERO	Now I arise:	999
	999
	[Resumes his mantle]	999
	999
	Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.	999
	Here in this island we arrived; and here	999
	Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit	999
	Than other princesses can that have more time	999
	For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,	999
	For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason	999
	For raising this sea-storm?	999
	999
PROSPERO	Know thus far forth.	999
	By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,	999
	Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies	999
	Brought to this shore; and by my prescience	999
	I find my zenith doth depend upon	999
	A most auspicious star, whose influence	999
	If now I court not but omit, my fortunes	999
	Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:	999
	Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,	999
	And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.	999
	999
	[MIRANDA sleeps]	999
	999
	Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.	999
	Approach, my Ariel, come.	999
	999
	[Enter ARIEL]	999
	999
ARIEL	All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come	999
	To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,	999
	To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride	999
	On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task	999
	Ariel and all his quality.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Hast thou, spirit,	999
	Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?	999
	999
ARIEL	To every article.	999
	I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,	999
	Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,	999
	I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,	999
	And burn in many places; on the topmast,	999
	The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,	999
	Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors	999
	O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary	999
	And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks	999
	Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune	999
	Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,	999
	Yea, his dread trident shake.	999
	999
PROSPERO	My brave spirit!	999
	Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil	999
	Would not infect his reason?	999
	999
ARIEL	Not a soul	999
	But felt a fever of the mad and play'd	999
	Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners	999
	Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,	999
	Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,	999
	With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--	999
	Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty	999
	And all the devils are here.'	999
	999
PROSPERO	Why that's my spirit!	999
	But was not this nigh shore?	999
	999
ARIEL	Close by, my master.	999
	999
PROSPERO	But are they, Ariel, safe?	999
	999
ARIEL	Not a hair perish'd;	999
	On their sustaining garments not a blemish,	999
	But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,	999
	In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.	999
	The king's son have I landed by himself;	999
	Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs	999
	In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,	999
	His arms in this sad knot.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Of the king's ship	999
	The mariners say how thou hast disposed	999
	And all the rest o' the fleet.	999
	999
ARIEL	Safely in harbour	999
	Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once	999
	Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew	999
	From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:	999
	The mariners all under hatches stow'd;	999
	Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,	999
	I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet	999
	Which I dispersed, they all have met again	999
	And are upon the Mediterranean flote,	999
	Bound sadly home for Naples,	999
	Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd	999
	And his great person perish.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Ariel, thy charge	999
	Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.	999
	What is the time o' the day?	999
	999
ARIEL	Past the mid season.	999
	999
PROSPERO	At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now	999
	Must by us both be spent most preciously.	999
	999
ARIEL	Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,	999
	Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,	999
	Which is not yet perform'd me.	999
	999
PROSPERO	How now? moody?	999
	What is't thou canst demand?	999
	999
ARIEL	My liberty.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Before the time be out? no more!	999
	999
ARIEL	I prithee,	999
	Remember I have done thee worthy service;	999
	Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served	999
	Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise	999
	To bate me a full year.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Dost thou forget	999
	From what a torment I did free thee?	999
	999
ARIEL	No.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze	999
	Of the salt deep,	999
	To run upon the sharp wind of the north,	999
	To do me business in the veins o' the earth	999
	When it is baked with frost.	999
	999
ARIEL	I do not, sir.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot	999
	The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy	999
	Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?	999
	999
ARIEL	No, sir.	999
	999
PROSPERO	     Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.	999
	999
ARIEL	Sir, in Argier.	999
	999
PROSPERO	                  O, was she so? I must	999
	Once in a month recount what thou hast been,	999
	Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,	999
	For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible	999
	To enter human hearing, from Argier,	999
	Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did	999
	They would not take her life. Is not this true?	999
	999
ARIEL	Ay, sir.	999
	999
PROSPERO	This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child	999
	And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,	999
	As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;	999
	And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate	999
	To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,	999
	Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,	999
	By help of her more potent ministers	999
	And in her most unmitigable rage,	999
	Into a cloven pine; within which rift	999
	Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain	999
	A dozen years; within which space she died	999
	And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans	999
	As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--	999
	Save for the son that she did litter here,	999
	A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with	999
	A human shape.	999
	999
ARIEL	                  Yes, Caliban her son.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban	999
	Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st	999
	What torment I did find thee in; thy groans	999
	Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts	999
	Of ever angry bears: it was a torment	999
	To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax	999
	Could not again undo: it was mine art,	999
	When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape	999
	The pine and let thee out.	999
	999
ARIEL	I thank thee, master.	999
	999
PROSPERO	If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak	999
	And peg thee in his knotty entrails till	999
	Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.	999
	999
ARIEL	Pardon, master;	999
	I will be correspondent to command	999
	And do my spiriting gently.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Do so, and after two days	999
	I will discharge thee.	999
	999
ARIEL	That's my noble master!	999
	What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?	999
	999
PROSPERO	Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject	999
	To no sight but thine and mine, invisible	999
	To every eyeball else. Go take this shape	999
	And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!	999
	999
	[Exit ARIEL]	999
	999
	Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!	999
	999
MIRANDA	     The strangeness of your story put	999
	Heaviness in me.	999
	999
PROSPERO	                  Shake it off. Come on;	999
	We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never	999
	Yields us kind answer.	999
	999
MIRANDA	'Tis a villain, sir,	999
	I do not love to look on.	999
	999
PROSPERO	But, as 'tis,	999
	We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,	999
	Fetch in our wood and serves in offices	999
	That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!	999
	Thou earth, thou! speak.	999
	999
CALIBAN	[Within]  There's wood enough within.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:	999
	Come, thou tortoise! when?	999
	999
	[Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph]	999
	999
	Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,	999
	Hark in thine ear.	999
	999
ARIEL	                  My lord it shall be done.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PROSPERO	Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself	999
	Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!	999
	999
	[Enter CALIBAN]	999
	999
CALIBAN	As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd	999
	With raven's feather from unwholesome fen	999
	Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye	999
	And blister you all o'er!	999
	999
PROSPERO	For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,	999
	Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins	999
	Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,	999
	All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd	999
	As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging	999
	Than bees that made 'em.	999
	999
CALIBAN	I must eat my dinner.	999
	This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,	999
	Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,	999
	Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me	999
	Water with berries in't, and teach me how	999
	To name the bigger light, and how the less,	999
	That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee	999
	And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,	999
	The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:	999
	Cursed be I that did so! All the charms	999
	Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!	999
	For I am all the subjects that you have,	999
	Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me	999
	In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me	999
	The rest o' the island.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Thou most lying slave,	999
	Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,	999
	Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee	999
	In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate	999
	The honour of my child.	999
	999
CALIBAN	O ho, O ho! would't had been done!	999
	Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else	999
	This isle with Calibans.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Abhorred slave,	999
	Which any print of goodness wilt not take,	999
	Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,	999
	Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour	999
	One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,	999
	Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like	999
	A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes	999
	With words that made them known. But thy vile race,	999
	Though thou didst learn, had that in't which	999
	good natures	999
	Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou	999
	Deservedly confined into this rock,	999
	Who hadst deserved more than a prison.	999
	999
CALIBAN	You taught me language; and my profit on't	999
	Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you	999
	For learning me your language!	999
	999
PROSPERO	Hag-seed, hence!	999
	Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,	999
	To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?	999
	If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly	999
	What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,	999
	Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar	999
	That beasts shall tremble at thy din.	999
	999
CALIBAN	No, pray thee.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	I must obey: his art is of such power,	999
	It would control my dam's god, Setebos,	999
	and make a vassal of him.	999
	999
PROSPERO	So, slave; hence!	999
	999
	[Exit CALIBAN]	999
	999
	[Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing;	999
	FERDINAND following]	999
	999
	ARIEL'S song.	999
	999
	Come unto these yellow sands,	999
	And then take hands:	999
	Courtsied when you have and kiss'd	999
	The wild waves whist,	999
	Foot it featly here and there;	999
	And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.	999
	Hark, hark!	999
	999
	[Burthen [dispersedly, within]  Bow-wow]	999
	999
	The watch-dogs bark!	999
	999
	[Burthen Bow-wow]	999
	999
	Hark, hark! I hear	999
	The strain of strutting chanticleer	999
	Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?	999
	It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon	999
	Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,	999
	Weeping again the king my father's wreck,	999
	This music crept by me upon the waters,	999
	Allaying both their fury and my passion	999
	With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,	999
	Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.	999
	No, it begins again.	999
	999
	[ARIEL sings]	999
	999
	Full fathom five thy father lies;	999
	Of his bones are coral made;	999
	Those are pearls that were his eyes:	999
	Nothing of him that doth fade	999
	But doth suffer a sea-change	999
	Into something rich and strange.	999
	Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell	999
	999
	[Burthen Ding-dong]	999
	999
	Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.	999
	999
FERDINAND	The ditty does remember my drown'd father.	999
	This is no mortal business, nor no sound	999
	That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.	999
	999
PROSPERO	The fringed curtains of thine eye advance	999
	And say what thou seest yond.	999
	999
MIRANDA	What is't? a spirit?	999
	Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,	999
	It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.	999
	999
PROSPERO	No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses	999
	As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest	999
	Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd	999
	With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him	999
	A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows	999
	And strays about to find 'em.	999
	999
MIRANDA	I might call him	999
	A thing divine, for nothing natural	999
	I ever saw so noble.	999
	999
PROSPERO	[Aside] It goes on, I see,	999
	As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee	999
	Within two days for this.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Most sure, the goddess	999
	On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer	999
	May know if you remain upon this island;	999
	And that you will some good instruction give	999
	How I may bear me here: my prime request,	999
	Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!	999
	If you be maid or no?	999
	999
MIRANDA	No wonder, sir;	999
	But certainly a maid.	999
	999
FERDINAND	My language! heavens!	999
	I am the best of them that speak this speech,	999
	Were I but where 'tis spoken.	999
	999
PROSPERO	How? the best?	999
	What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?	999
	999
FERDINAND	A single thing, as I am now, that wonders	999
	To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;	999
	And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,	999
	Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld	999
	The king my father wreck'd.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Alack, for mercy!	999
	999
FERDINAND	Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan	999
	And his brave son being twain.	999
	999
PROSPERO	[Aside]	The Duke of Milan	999
	And his more braver daughter could control thee,	999
	If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight	999
	They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,	999
	I'll set thee free for this.	999
	999
	[To FERDINAND]	999
	999
		        A word, good sir;	999
	I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Why speaks my father so ungently? This	999
	Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first	999
	That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father	999
	To be inclined my way!	999
	999
FERDINAND	O, if a virgin,	999
	And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you	999
	The queen of Naples.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Soft, sir! one word more.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	They are both in either's powers; but this swift business	999
	I must uneasy make, lest too light winning	999
	Make the prize light.	999
	999
	[To FERDINAND]	999
	999
		One word more; I charge thee	999
	That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp	999
	The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself	999
	Upon this island as a spy, to win it	999
	From me, the lord on't.	999
	999
FERDINAND	No, as I am a man.	999
	999
MIRANDA	There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:	999
	If the ill spirit have so fair a house,	999
	Good things will strive to dwell with't.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Follow me.	999
	Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;	999
	I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:	999
	Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be	999
	The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks	999
	Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.	999
	999
FERDINAND	No;	999
	I will resist such entertainment till	999
	Mine enemy has more power.	999
	999
	[Draws, and is charmed from moving]	999
	999
MIRANDA	O dear father,	999
	Make not too rash a trial of him, for	999
	He's gentle and not fearful.	999
	999
PROSPERO	What? I say,	999
	My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;	999
	Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience	999
	Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,	999
	For I can here disarm thee with this stick	999
	And make thy weapon drop.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Beseech you, father.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Hence! hang not on my garments.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Sir, have pity;	999
	I'll be his surety.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Silence! one word more	999
	Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!	999
	An advocate for an imposter! hush!	999
	Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,	999
	Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!	999
	To the most of men this is a Caliban	999
	And they to him are angels.	999
	999
MIRANDA	My affections	999
	Are then most humble; I have no ambition	999
	To see a goodlier man.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Come on; obey:	999
	Thy nerves are in their infancy again	999
	And have no vigour in them.	999
	999
FERDINAND	So they are;	999
	My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.	999
	My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,	999
	The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,	999
	To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,	999
	Might I but through my prison once a day	999
	Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth	999
	Let liberty make use of; space enough	999
	Have I in such a prison.	999
	999
PROSPERO	[Aside]                It works.	999
	999
	[To FERDINAND]	999
	999
		                  Come on.	999
	Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!	999
	999
	[To FERDINAND]	999
	999
		                  Follow me.	999
	999
	[To ARIEL]	999
	999
	Hark what thou else shalt do me.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Be of comfort;	999
	My father's of a better nature, sir,	999
	Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted	999
	Which now came from him.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Thou shalt be free	999
	As mountain winds: but then exactly do	999
	All points of my command.	999
	999
ARIEL	To the syllable.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Come, follow. Speak not for him.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Another part of the island.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO,	999
	ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others]	999
	999
GONZALO	Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,	999
	So have we all, of joy; for our escape	999
	Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe	999
	Is common; every day some sailor's wife,	999
	The masters of some merchant and the merchant	999
	Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,	999
	I mean our preservation, few in millions	999
	Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh	999
	Our sorrow with our comfort.	999
	999
ALONSO	Prithee, peace.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	He receives comfort like cold porridge.	999
	999
ANTONIO	The visitor will not give him o'er so.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;	999
	by and by it will strike.	999
	999
GONZALO	Sir,--	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	One: tell.	999
	999
GONZALO	When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,	999
	Comes to the entertainer--	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	A dollar.	999
	999
GONZALO	Dolour comes to him, indeed: you	999
	have spoken truer than you purposed.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.	999
	999
GONZALO	Therefore, my lord,--	999
	999
ANTONIO	Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!	999
	999
ALONSO	I prithee, spare.	999
	999
GONZALO	Well, I have done: but yet,--	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	He will be talking.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Which, of he or Adrian, for a good	999
	wager, first begins to crow?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	The old cock.	999
	999
ANTONIO	The cockerel.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Done. The wager?	999
	999
ANTONIO	A laughter.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	A match!	999
	999
ADRIAN	Though this island seem to be desert,--	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.	999
	999
ADRIAN	Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Yet,--	999
	999
ADRIAN	Yet,--	999
	999
ANTONIO	He could not miss't.	999
	999
ADRIAN	It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate	999
	temperance.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Temperance was a delicate wench.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.	999
	999
ADRIAN	The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	As if it had lungs and rotten ones.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.	999
	999
GONZALO	Here is everything advantageous to life.	999
	999
ANTONIO	True; save means to live.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Of that there's none, or little.	999
	999
GONZALO	How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!	999
	999
ANTONIO	The ground indeed is tawny.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	With an eye of green in't.	999
	999
ANTONIO	He misses not much.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.	999
	999
GONZALO	But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost	999
	beyond credit,--	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	As many vouched rarities are.	999
	999
GONZALO	That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in	999
	the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and	999
	glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with	999
	salt water.	999
	999
ANTONIO	If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not	999
	say he lies?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report	999
	999
GONZALO	Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we	999
	put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of	999
	the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.	999
	999
ADRIAN	Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to	999
	their queen.	999
	999
GONZALO	Not since widow Dido's time.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?	999
	widow Dido!	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,	999
	how you take it!	999
	999
ADRIAN	'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:	999
	she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.	999
	999
GONZALO	This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.	999
	999
ADRIAN	Carthage?	999
	999
GONZALO	I assure you, Carthage.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath	999
	raised the wall and houses too.	999
	999
ANTONIO	What impossible matter will he make easy next?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	I think he will carry this island home in his pocket	999
	and give it his son for an apple.	999
	999
ANTONIO	And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring	999
	forth more islands.	999
	999
GONZALO	Ay.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Why, in good time.	999
	999
GONZALO	Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now	999
	as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage	999
	of your daughter, who is now queen.	999
	999
ANTONIO	And the rarest that e'er came there.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.	999
	999
ANTONIO	O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.	999
	999
GONZALO	Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I	999
	wore it? I mean, in a sort.	999
	999
ANTONIO	That sort was well fished for.	999
	999
GONZALO	When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?	999
	999
ALONSO	You cram these words into mine ears against	999
	The stomach of my sense. Would I had never	999
	Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,	999
	My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,	999
	Who is so far from Italy removed	999
	I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir	999
	Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish	999
	Hath made his meal on thee?	999
	999
FRANCISCO	Sir, he may live:	999
	I saw him beat the surges under him,	999
	And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,	999
	Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted	999
	The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head	999
	'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd	999
	Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke	999
	To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,	999
	As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt	999
	He came alive to land.	999
	999
ALONSO	No, no, he's gone.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,	999
	That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,	999
	But rather lose her to an African;	999
	Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,	999
	Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.	999
	999
ALONSO	Prithee, peace.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise	999
	By all of us, and the fair soul herself	999
	Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at	999
	Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your	999
	son,	999
	I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have	999
	More widows in them of this business' making	999
	Than we bring men to comfort them:	999
	The fault's your own.	999
	999
ALONSO	So is the dear'st o' the loss.	999
	999
GONZALO	My lord Sebastian,	999
	The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness	999
	And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,	999
	When you should bring the plaster.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Very well.	999
	999
ANTONIO	And most chirurgeonly.	999
	999
GONZALO	It is foul weather in us all, good sir,	999
	When you are cloudy.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Foul weather?	999
	999
ANTONIO	Very foul.	999
	999
GONZALO	Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--	999
	999
ANTONIO	He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Or docks, or mallows.	999
	999
GONZALO	And were the king on't, what would I do?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	'Scape being drunk for want of wine.	999
	999
GONZALO	I' the commonwealth I would by contraries	999
	Execute all things; for no kind of traffic	999
	Would I admit; no name of magistrate;	999
	Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,	999
	And use of service, none; contract, succession,	999
	Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;	999
	No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;	999
	No occupation; all men idle, all;	999
	And women too, but innocent and pure;	999
	No sovereignty;--	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	                  Yet he would be king on't.	999
	999
ANTONIO	The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the	999
	beginning.	999
	999
GONZALO	All things in common nature should produce	999
	Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,	999
	Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,	999
	Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,	999
	Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,	999
	To feed my innocent people.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	No marrying 'mong his subjects?	999
	999
ANTONIO	None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.	999
	999
GONZALO	I would with such perfection govern, sir,	999
	To excel the golden age.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	God save his majesty!	999
	999
ANTONIO	Long live Gonzalo!	999
	999
GONZALO	                  And,--do you mark me, sir?	999
	999
ALONSO	Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.	999
	999
GONZALO	I do well believe your highness; and	999
	did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,	999
	who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that	999
	they always use to laugh at nothing.	999
	999
ANTONIO	'Twas you we laughed at.	999
	999
GONZALO	Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing	999
	to you: so you may continue and laugh at	999
	nothing still.	999
	999
ANTONIO	What a blow was there given!	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	An it had not fallen flat-long.	999
	999
GONZALO	You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift	999
	the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue	999
	in it five weeks without changing.	999
	999
	[Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music]	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Nay, good my lord, be not angry.	999
	999
GONZALO	No, I warrant you; I will not adventure	999
	my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh	999
	me asleep, for I am very heavy?	999
	999
ANTONIO	Go sleep, and hear us.	999
	999
	[All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO]	999
	999
ALONSO	What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes	999
	Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find	999
	They are inclined to do so.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Please you, sir,	999
	Do not omit the heavy offer of it:	999
	It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,	999
	It is a comforter.	999
	999
ANTONIO	                  We two, my lord,	999
	Will guard your person while you take your rest,	999
	And watch your safety.	999
	999
ALONSO	Thank you. Wondrous heavy.	999
	999
	[ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL]	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	What a strange drowsiness possesses them!	999
	999
ANTONIO	It is the quality o' the climate.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Why	999
	Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not	999
	Myself disposed to sleep.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Nor I; my spirits are nimble.	999
	They fell together all, as by consent;	999
	They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,	999
	Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--	999
	And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,	999
	What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and	999
	My strong imagination sees a crown	999
	Dropping upon thy head.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	What, art thou waking?	999
	999
ANTONIO	Do you not hear me speak?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	I do; and surely	999
	It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st	999
	Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?	999
	This is a strange repose, to be asleep	999
	With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,	999
	And yet so fast asleep.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Noble Sebastian,	999
	Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st	999
	Whiles thou art waking.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Thou dost snore distinctly;	999
	There's meaning in thy snores.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I am more serious than my custom: you	999
	Must be so too, if heed me; which to do	999
	Trebles thee o'er.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	                  Well, I am standing water.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I'll teach you how to flow.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Do so: to ebb	999
	Hereditary sloth instructs me.	999
	999
ANTONIO	O,	999
	If you but knew how you the purpose cherish	999
	Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,	999
	You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,	999
	Most often do so near the bottom run	999
	By their own fear or sloth.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Prithee, say on:	999
	The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim	999
	A matter from thee, and a birth indeed	999
	Which throes thee much to yield.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Thus, sir:	999
	Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,	999
	Who shall be of as little memory	999
	When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--	999
	For he's a spirit of persuasion, only	999
	Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,	999
	'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd	999
	And he that sleeps here swims.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	I have no hope	999
	That he's undrown'd.	999
	999
ANTONIO	O, out of that 'no hope'	999
	What great hope have you! no hope that way is	999
	Another way so high a hope that even	999
	Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,	999
	But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me	999
	That Ferdinand is drown'd?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	He's gone.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Then, tell me,	999
	Who's the next heir of Naples?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Claribel.	999
	999
ANTONIO	She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells	999
	Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples	999
	Can have no note, unless the sun were post--	999
	The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins	999
	Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?	999
	We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,	999
	And by that destiny to perform an act	999
	Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come	999
	In yours and my discharge.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	What stuff is this! how say you?	999
	'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;	999
	So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions	999
	There is some space.	999
	999
ANTONIO	A space whose every cubit	999
	Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel	999
	Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,	999
	And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death	999
	That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse	999
	Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples	999
	As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate	999
	As amply and unnecessarily	999
	As this Gonzalo; I myself could make	999
	A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore	999
	The mind that I do! what a sleep were this	999
	For your advancement! Do you understand me?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Methinks I do.	999
	999
ANTONIO	                  And how does your content	999
	Tender your own good fortune?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	I remember	999
	You did supplant your brother Prospero.	999
	999
ANTONIO	True:	999
	And look how well my garments sit upon me;	999
	Much feater than before: my brother's servants	999
	Were then my fellows; now they are my men.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	But, for your conscience?	999
	999
ANTONIO	Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,	999
	'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not	999
	This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,	999
	That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they	999
	And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,	999
	No better than the earth he lies upon,	999
	If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;	999
	Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,	999
	Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,	999
	To the perpetual wink for aye might put	999
	This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who	999
	Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,	999
	They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;	999
	They'll tell the clock to any business that	999
	We say befits the hour.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Thy case, dear friend,	999
	Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,	999
	I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke	999
	Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;	999
	And I the king shall love thee.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Draw together;	999
	And when I rear my hand, do you the like,	999
	To fall it on Gonzalo.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	O, but one word.	999
	999
	[They talk apart]	999
	999
	[Re-enter ARIEL, invisible]	999
	999
ARIEL	My master through his art foresees the danger	999
	That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--	999
	For else his project dies--to keep them living.	999
	999
	[Sings in GONZALO's ear]	999
	999
	While you here do snoring lie,	999
	Open-eyed conspiracy	999
	His time doth take.	999
	If of life you keep a care,	999
	Shake off slumber, and beware:	999
	Awake, awake!	999
	999
ANTONIO	Then let us both be sudden.	999
	999
GONZALO	Now, good angels	999
	Preserve the king.	999
	999
	[They wake]	999
	999
ALONSO	Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?	999
	Wherefore this ghastly looking?	999
	999
GONZALO	What's the matter?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Whiles we stood here securing your repose,	999
	Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing	999
	Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?	999
	It struck mine ear most terribly.	999
	999
ALONSO	I heard nothing.	999
	999
ANTONIO	O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,	999
	To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar	999
	Of a whole herd of lions.	999
	999
ALONSO	Heard you this, Gonzalo?	999
	999
GONZALO	Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,	999
	And that a strange one too, which did awake me:	999
	I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,	999
	I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,	999
	That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,	999
	Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.	999
	999
ALONSO	Lead off this ground; and let's make further search	999
	For my poor son.	999
	999
GONZALO	Heavens keep him from these beasts!	999
	For he is, sure, i' the island.	999
	999
ALONSO	Lead away.	999
	999
ARIEL	Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:	999
	So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

	999
	THE TEMPEST	999
	999
	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Another part of the island.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of	999
	thunder heard]	999
	999
CALIBAN	All the infections that the sun sucks up	999
	From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him	999
	By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me	999
	And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,	999
	Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,	999
	Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark	999
	Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but	999
	For every trifle are they set upon me;	999
	Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me	999
	And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which	999
	Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount	999
	Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I	999
	All wound with adders who with cloven tongues	999
	Do hiss me into madness.	999
	999
	[Enter TRINCULO]	999
	999
		    Lo, now, lo!	999
	999
	Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me	999
	For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;	999
	Perchance he will not mind me.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off	999
	any weather at all, and another storm brewing;	999
	I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black	999
	cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul	999
	bombard that would shed his liquor. If it	999
	should thunder as it did before, I know not	999
	where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot	999
	choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we	999
	here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:	999
	he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-	999
	like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-	999
	John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,	999
	as once I was, and had but this fish painted,	999
	not a holiday fool there but would give a piece	999
	of silver: there would this monster make a	999
	man; any strange beast there makes a man:	999
	when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame	999
	beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead	999
	Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like	999
	arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose	999
	my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,	999
	but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a	999
	thunderbolt.	999
	999
	[Thunder]	999
	999
	Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to	999
	creep under his gaberdine; there is no other	999
	shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with	999
	strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the	999
	dregs of the storm be past.	999
	999
	[Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand]	999
	999
STEPHANO	   I shall no more to sea, to sea,	999
	Here shall I die ashore--	999
	999
	This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's	999
	funeral: well, here's my comfort. [Drinks]	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,	999
	The gunner and his mate	999
	Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,	999
	But none of us cared for Kate;	999
	For she had a tongue with a tang,	999
	Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!	999
	She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,	999
	Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:	999
	Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!	999
	999
	This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.	999
	[Drinks]	999
	999
CALIBAN	Do not torment me: Oh!	999
	999
STEPHANO	What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put	999
	tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I	999
	have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your	999
	four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as	999
	ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;	999
	and it shall be said so again while Stephano	999
	breathes at's nostrils.	999
	999
CALIBAN	The spirit torments me; Oh!	999
	999
STEPHANO	This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who	999
	hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil	999
	should he learn our language? I will give him some	999
	relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him	999
	and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a	999
	present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.	999
	999
CALIBAN	Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.	999
	999
STEPHANO	He's in his fit now and does not talk after the	999
	wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have	999
	never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his	999
	fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will	999
	not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that	999
	hath him, and that soundly.	999
	999
CALIBAN	Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I	999
	know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that	999
	which will give language to you, cat: open your	999
	mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,	999
	and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:	999
	open your chaps again.	999
	999
TRINCULO	I should know that voice: it should be--but he is	999
	drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!	999
	999
STEPHANO	Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!	999
	His forward voice now is to speak well of his	999
	friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches	999
	and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will	999
	recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I	999
	will pour some in thy other mouth.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Stephano!	999
	999
STEPHANO	Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is	999
	a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no	999
	long spoon.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and	999
	speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy	999
	good friend Trinculo.	999
	999
STEPHANO	If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee	999
	by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,	999
	these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How	999
	camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can	999
	he vent Trinculos?	999
	999
TRINCULO	I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But	999
	art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art	999
	not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me	999
	under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of	999
	the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O	999
	Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!	999
	999
STEPHANO	Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.	999
	999
CALIBAN	[Aside]  These be fine things, an if they be	999
	not sprites.	999
	That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.	999
	I will kneel to him.	999
	999
STEPHANO	How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?	999
	swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I	999
	escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors	999
	heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of	999
	the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was	999
	cast ashore.	999
	999
CALIBAN	I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;	999
	for the liquor is not earthly.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Here; swear then how thou escapedst.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a	999
	duck, I'll be sworn.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a	999
	duck, thou art made like a goose.	999
	999
TRINCULO	O Stephano. hast any more of this?	999
	999
STEPHANO	The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the	999
	sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!	999
	how does thine ague?	999
	999
CALIBAN	Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?	999
	999
STEPHANO	Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'	999
	the moon when time was.	999
	999
CALIBAN	I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:	999
	My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish	999
	it anon with new contents swear.	999
	999
TRINCULO	By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!	999
	I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'	999
	the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well	999
	drawn, monster, in good sooth!	999
	999
CALIBAN	I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;	999
	And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.	999
	999
TRINCULO	By this light, a most perfidious and drunken	999
	monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.	999
	999
CALIBAN	I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Come on then; down, and swear.	999
	999
TRINCULO	I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed	999
	monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my	999
	heart to beat him,--	999
	999
STEPHANO	Come, kiss.	999
	999
TRINCULO	But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!	999
	999
CALIBAN	I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;	999
	I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.	999
	A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!	999
	I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,	999
	Thou wondrous man.	999
	999
TRINCULO	A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a	999
	Poor drunkard!	999
	999
CALIBAN	I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;	999
	And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;	999
	Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how	999
	To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee	999
	To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee	999
	Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?	999
	999
STEPHANO	I prithee now, lead the way without any more	999
	talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company	999
	else being drowned, we will inherit here: here;	999
	bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by	999
	and by again.	999
	999
CALIBAN	[Sings drunkenly]	999
	Farewell master; farewell, farewell!	999
	999
TRINCULO	A howling monster: a drunken monster!	999
	999
CALIBAN	   No more dams I'll make for fish	999
	Nor fetch in firing	999
	At requiring;	999
	Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish	999
	'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban	999
	Has a new master: get a new man.	999
	999
	Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,	999
	hey-day, freedom!	999
	999
STEPHANO	O brave monster! Lead the way.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Before PROSPERO'S Cell.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log]	999
	999
FERDINAND	There be some sports are painful, and their labour	999
	Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness	999
	Are nobly undergone and most poor matters	999
	Point to rich ends. This my mean task	999
	Would be as heavy to me as odious, but	999
	The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead	999
	And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is	999
	Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,	999
	And he's composed of harshness. I must remove	999
	Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,	999
	Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress	999
	Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness	999
	Had never like executor. I forget:	999
	But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,	999
	Most busy lest, when I do it.	999
	999
	[Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen]	999
	999
MIRANDA	Alas, now, pray you,	999
	Work not so hard: I would the lightning had	999
	Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!	999
	Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,	999
	'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father	999
	Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;	999
	He's safe for these three hours.	999
	999
FERDINAND	O most dear mistress,	999
	The sun will set before I shall discharge	999
	What I must strive to do.	999
	999
MIRANDA	If you'll sit down,	999
	I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;	999
	I'll carry it to the pile.	999
	999
FERDINAND	No, precious creature;	999
	I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,	999
	Than you should such dishonour undergo,	999
	While I sit lazy by.	999
	999
MIRANDA	It would become me	999
	As well as it does you: and I should do it	999
	With much more ease; for my good will is to it,	999
	And yours it is against.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Poor worm, thou art infected!	999
	This visitation shows it.	999
	999
MIRANDA	You look wearily.	999
	999
FERDINAND	No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me	999
	When you are by at night. I do beseech you--	999
	Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--	999
	What is your name?	999
	999
MIRANDA	                  Miranda.--O my father,	999
	I have broke your hest to say so!	999
	999
FERDINAND	Admired Miranda!	999
	Indeed the top of admiration! worth	999
	What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady	999
	I have eyed with best regard and many a time	999
	The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage	999
	Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues	999
	Have I liked several women; never any	999
	With so fun soul, but some defect in her	999
	Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed	999
	And put it to the foil: but you, O you,	999
	So perfect and so peerless, are created	999
	Of every creature's best!	999
	999
MIRANDA	I do not know	999
	One of my sex; no woman's face remember,	999
	Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen	999
	More that I may call men than you, good friend,	999
	And my dear father: how features are abroad,	999
	I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,	999
	The jewel in my dower, I would not wish	999
	Any companion in the world but you,	999
	Nor can imagination form a shape,	999
	Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle	999
	Something too wildly and my father's precepts	999
	I therein do forget.	999
	999
FERDINAND	I am in my condition	999
	A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;	999
	I would, not so!--and would no more endure	999
	This wooden slavery than to suffer	999
	The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:	999
	The very instant that I saw you, did	999
	My heart fly to your service; there resides,	999
	To make me slave to it; and for your sake	999
	Am I this patient log--man.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Do you love me?	999
	999
FERDINAND	O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound	999
	And crown what I profess with kind event	999
	If I speak true! if hollowly, invert	999
	What best is boded me to mischief! I	999
	Beyond all limit of what else i' the world	999
	Do love, prize, honour you.	999
	999
MIRANDA	I am a fool	999
	To weep at what I am glad of.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Fair encounter	999
	Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace	999
	On that which breeds between 'em!	999
	999
FERDINAND	Wherefore weep you?	999
	999
MIRANDA	At mine unworthiness that dare not offer	999
	What I desire to give, and much less take	999
	What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;	999
	And all the more it seeks to hide itself,	999
	The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!	999
	And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!	999
	I am your wife, it you will marry me;	999
	If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow	999
	You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,	999
	Whether you will or no.	999
	999
FERDINAND	My mistress, dearest;	999
	And I thus humble ever.	999
	999
MIRANDA	My husband, then?	999
	999
FERDINAND	Ay, with a heart as willing	999
	As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.	999
	999
MIRANDA	And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewell	999
	Till half an hour hence.	999
	999
FERDINAND	A thousand thousand!	999
	999
	[Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally]	999
	999
PROSPERO	So glad of this as they I cannot be,	999
	Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing	999
	At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,	999
	For yet ere supper-time must I perform	999
	Much business appertaining.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Another part of the island.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO]	999
	999
STEPHANO	Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink	999
	water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and	999
	board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They	999
	say there's but five upon this isle: we are three	999
	of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the	999
	state totters.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes	999
	are almost set in thy head.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Where should they be set else? he were a brave	999
	monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.	999
	999
STEPHANO	My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:	999
	for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I	999
	could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off	999
	and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,	999
	monster, or my standard.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.	999
	999
STEPHANO	We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say	999
	nothing neither.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a	999
	good moon-calf.	999
	999
CALIBAN	How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.	999
	I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to	999
	justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,	999
	was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much	999
	sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,	999
	being but half a fish and half a monster?	999
	999
CALIBAN	Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?	999
	999
TRINCULO	'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!	999
	999
CALIBAN	Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you	999
	prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's	999
	my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.	999
	999
CALIBAN	I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to	999
	hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?	999
	999
STEPHANO	Marry, will I	kneel and repeat it; I will stand,	999
	and so shall Trinculo.	999
	999
	[Enter ARIEL, invisible]	999
	999
CALIBAN	As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a	999
	sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.	999
	999
ARIEL	Thou liest.	999
	999
CALIBAN	Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my	999
	valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by	999
	this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Why, I said nothing.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.	999
	999
CALIBAN	I say, by sorcery he got this isle;	999
	From me he got it. if thy greatness will	999
	Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,	999
	But this thing dare not,--	999
	999
STEPHANO	That's most certain.	999
	999
CALIBAN	Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.	999
	999
STEPHANO	How now shall this be compassed?	999
	Canst thou bring me to the party?	999
	999
CALIBAN	Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,	999
	Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.	999
	999
ARIEL	Thou liest; thou canst not.	999
	999
CALIBAN	What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!	999
	I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows	999
	And take his bottle from him: when that's gone	999
	He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him	999
	Where the quick freshes are.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Trinculo, run into no further danger:	999
	interrupt the monster one word further, and,	999
	by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors	999
	and make a stock-fish of thee.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther	999
	off.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Didst thou not say he lied?	999
	999
ARIEL	Thou liest.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Do I so? take thou that.	999
	999
	[Beats TRINCULO]	999
	999
	As you like this, give me the lie another time.	999
	999
TRINCULO	I did not give the lie. Out o' your	999
	wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!	999
	this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on	999
	your monster, and the devil take your fingers!	999
	999
CALIBAN	Ha, ha, ha!	999
	999
STEPHANO	Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther	999
	off.	999
	999
CALIBAN	Beat him enough: after a little time	999
	I'll beat him too.	999
	999
STEPHANO	                  Stand farther. Come, proceed.	999
	999
CALIBAN	Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,	999
	I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,	999
	Having first seized his books, or with a log	999
	Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,	999
	Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember	999
	First to possess his books; for without them	999
	He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not	999
	One spirit to command: they all do hate him	999
	As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.	999
	He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--	999
	Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal	999
	And that most deeply to consider is	999
	The beauty of his daughter; he himself	999
	Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,	999
	But only Sycorax my dam and she;	999
	But she as far surpasseth Sycorax	999
	As great'st does least.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Is it so brave a lass?	999
	999
CALIBAN	Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.	999
	And bring thee forth brave brood.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I	999
	will be king and queen--save our graces!--and	999
	Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou	999
	like the plot, Trinculo?	999
	999
TRINCULO	Excellent.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,	999
	while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.	999
	999
CALIBAN	Within this half hour will he be asleep:	999
	Wilt thou destroy him then?	999
	999
STEPHANO	Ay, on mine honour.	999
	999
ARIEL	This will I tell my master.	999
	999
CALIBAN	Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:	999
	Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch	999
	You taught me but while-ere?	999
	999
STEPHANO	At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any	999
	reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	Flout 'em and scout 'em	999
	And scout 'em and flout 'em	999
	Thought is free.	999
	999
CALIBAN	That's not the tune.	999
	999
	[Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe]	999
	999
STEPHANO	What is this same?	999
	999
TRINCULO	This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture	999
	of Nobody.	999
	999
STEPHANO	If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:	999
	if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.	999
	999
TRINCULO	O, forgive me my sins!	999
	999
STEPHANO	He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!	999
	999
CALIBAN	Art thou afeard?	999
	999
STEPHANO	No, monster, not I.	999
	999
CALIBAN	Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,	999
	Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.	999
	Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments	999
	Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices	999
	That, if I then had waked after long sleep,	999
	Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,	999
	The clouds methought would open and show riches	999
	Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,	999
	I cried to dream again.	999
	999
STEPHANO	This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall	999
	have my music for nothing.	999
	999
CALIBAN	When Prospero is destroyed.	999
	999
STEPHANO	That shall be by and by: I remember the story.	999
	999
TRINCULO	The sound is going away; let's follow it, and	999
	after do our work.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see	999
	this tabourer; he lays it on.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.	999

SCENE III	Another part of the island.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO,	999
	ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others]	999
	999
GONZALO	By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;	999
	My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed	999
	Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,	999
	I needs must rest me.	999
	999
ALONSO	Old lord, I cannot blame thee,	999
	Who am myself attach'd with weariness,	999
	To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.	999
	Even here I will put off my hope and keep it	999
	No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd	999
	Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks	999
	Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.	999
	999
ANTONIO	[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  I am right glad that he's so	999
	out of hope.	999
	Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose	999
	That you resolved to effect.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	[Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantage	999
	Will we take throughly.	999
	999
ANTONIO	[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  Let it be to-night;	999
	For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they	999
	Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance	999
	As when they are fresh.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	[Aside to ANTONIO]  I say, to-night: no more.	999
	999
	[Solemn and strange music]	999
	999
ALONSO	What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!	999
	999
GONZALO	Marvellous sweet music!	999
	999
	[Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several	999
	strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet;	999
	they dance about it with gentle actions of	999
	salutation; and, inviting the King, &c. to	999
	eat, they depart]	999
	999
ALONSO	Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	A living drollery. Now I will believe	999
	That there are unicorns, that in Arabia	999
	There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix	999
	At this hour reigning there.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I'll believe both;	999
	And what does else want credit, come to me,	999
	And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did	999
	lie,	999
	Though fools at home condemn 'em.	999
	999
GONZALO	If in Naples	999
	I should report this now, would they believe me?	999
	If I should say, I saw such islanders--	999
	For, certes, these are people of the island--	999
	Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,	999
	Their manners are more gentle-kind than of	999
	Our human generation you shall find	999
	Many, nay, almost any.	999
	999
PROSPERO	[Aside]              Honest lord,	999
	Thou hast said well; for some of you there present	999
	Are worse than devils.	999
	999
ALONSO	I cannot too much muse	999
	Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,	999
	Although they want the use of tongue, a kind	999
	Of excellent dumb discourse.	999
	999
PROSPERO	[Aside]	Praise in departing.	999
	999
FRANCISCO	They vanish'd strangely.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	No matter, since	999
	They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.	999
	Will't please you taste of what is here?	999
	999
ALONSO	Not I.	999
	999
GONZALO	Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,	999
	Who would believe that there were mountaineers	999
	Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em	999
	Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men	999
	Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find	999
	Each putter-out of five for one will bring us	999
	Good warrant of.	999
	999
ALONSO	                  I will stand to and feed,	999
	Although my last: no matter, since I feel	999
	The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,	999
	Stand to and do as we.	999
	999
	[Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a	999
	harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and,	999
	with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes]	999
	999
ARIEL	You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,	999
	That hath to instrument this lower world	999
	And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea	999
	Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island	999
	Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men	999
	Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;	999
	And even with such-like valour men hang and drown	999
	Their proper selves.	999
	999
	[ALONSO, SEBASTIAN &c. draw their swords]	999
	999
		You fools! I and my fellows	999
	Are ministers of Fate: the elements,	999
	Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well	999
	Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs	999
	Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish	999
	One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers	999
	Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,	999
	Your swords are now too massy for your strengths	999
	And will not be uplifted. But remember--	999
	For that's my business to you--that you three	999
	From Milan did supplant good Prospero;	999
	Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,	999
	Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed	999
	The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have	999
	Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,	999
	Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,	999
	They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:	999
	Lingering perdition, worse than any death	999
	Can be at once, shall step by step attend	999
	You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--	999
	Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls	999
	Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow	999
	And a clear life ensuing.	999
	999
	[He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music	999
	enter the Shapes again, and dance, with	999
	mocks and mows, and carrying out the table]	999
	999
PROSPERO	Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou	999
	Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:	999
	Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated	999
	In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life	999
	And observation strange, my meaner ministers	999
	Their several kinds have done. My high charms work	999
	And these mine enemies are all knit up	999
	In their distractions; they now are in my power;	999
	And in these fits I leave them, while I visit	999
	Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,	999
	And his and mine loved darling.	999
	999
	[Exit above]	999
	999
GONZALO	I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you	999
	In this strange stare?	999
	999
ALONSO	O, it is monstrous, monstrous:	999
	Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;	999
	The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,	999
	That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced	999
	The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.	999
	Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and	999
	I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded	999
	And with him there lie mudded.	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	But one fiend at a time,	999
	I'll fight their legions o'er.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I'll be thy second.	999
	999
	[Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO]	999
	999
GONZALO	All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,	999
	Like poison given to work a great time after,	999
	Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you	999
	That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly	999
	And hinder them from what this ecstasy	999
	May now provoke them to.	999
	999
ADRIAN	Follow, I pray you.	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Before PROSPERO'S cell.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA]	999
	999
PROSPERO	If I have too austerely punish'd you,	999
	Your compensation makes amends, for I	999
	Have given you here a third of mine own life,	999
	Or that for which I live; who once again	999
	I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations	999
	Were but my trials of thy love and thou	999
	Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,	999
	I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,	999
	Do not smile at me that I boast her off,	999
	For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise	999
	And make it halt behind her.	999
	999
FERDINAND	I do believe it	999
	Against an oracle.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition	999
	Worthily purchased take my daughter: but	999
	If thou dost break her virgin-knot before	999
	All sanctimonious ceremonies may	999
	With full and holy rite be minister'd,	999
	No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall	999
	To make this contract grow: but barren hate,	999
	Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew	999
	The union of your bed with weeds so loathly	999
	That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,	999
	As Hymen's lamps shall light you.	999
	999
FERDINAND	As I hope	999
	For quiet days, fair issue and long life,	999
	With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,	999
	The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.	999
	Our worser genius can, shall never melt	999
	Mine honour into lust, to take away	999
	The edge of that day's celebration	999
	When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,	999
	Or Night kept chain'd below.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Fairly spoke.	999
	Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.	999
	What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!	999
	999
	[Enter ARIEL]	999
	999
ARIEL	What would my potent master? here I am.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service	999
	Did worthily perform; and I must use you	999
	In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,	999
	O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:	999
	Incite them to quick motion; for I must	999
	Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple	999
	Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,	999
	And they expect it from me.	999
	999
ARIEL	Presently?	999
	999
PROSPERO	Ay, with a twink.	999
	999
ARIEL	   Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'	999
	And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'	999
	Each one, tripping on his toe,	999
	Will be here with mop and mow.	999
	Do you love me, master? no?	999
	999
PROSPERO	Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach	999
	Till thou dost hear me call.	999
	999
ARIEL	Well, I conceive.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PROSPERO	Look thou be true; do not give dalliance	999
	Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw	999
	To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,	999
	Or else, good night your vow!	999
	999
FERDINAND	I warrant you sir;	999
	The white cold virgin snow upon my heart	999
	Abates the ardour of my liver.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Well.	999
	Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,	999
	Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!	999
	No tongue! all eyes! be silent.	999
	999
	[Soft music]	999
	999
	[Enter IRIS]	999
	999
IRIS	Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas	999
	Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;	999
	Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,	999
	And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;	999
	Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,	999
	Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,	999
	To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,	999
	Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,	999
	Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;	999
	And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,	999
	Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,	999
	Whose watery arch and messenger am I,	999
	Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,	999
	Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,	999
	To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:	999
	Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.	999
	999
	[Enter CERES]	999
	999
CERES	Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er	999
	Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;	999
	Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers	999
	Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,	999
	And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown	999
	My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,	999
	Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen	999
	Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?	999
	999
IRIS	A contract of true love to celebrate;	999
	And some donation freely to estate	999
	On the blest lovers.	999
	999
CERES	Tell me, heavenly bow,	999
	If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,	999
	Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot	999
	The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,	999
	Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company	999
	I have forsworn.	999
	999
IRIS	                  Of her society	999
	Be not afraid: I met her deity	999
	Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son	999
	Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done	999
	Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,	999
	Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid	999
	Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain;	999
	Mars's hot minion is returned again;	999
	Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,	999
	Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows	999
	And be a boy right out.	999
	999
CERES	High'st queen of state,	999
	Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.	999
	999
	[Enter JUNO]	999
	999
JUNO	How does my bounteous sister? Go with me	999
	To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be	999
	And honour'd in their issue.	999
	999
	[They sing:]	999
	999
JUNO	   Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,	999
	Long continuance, and increasing,	999
	Hourly joys be still upon you!	999
	Juno sings her blessings upon you.	999
	999
CERES	   Earth's increase, foison plenty,	999
	Barns and garners never empty,	999
	Vines and clustering bunches growing,	999
	Plants with goodly burthen bowing;	999
	Spring come to you at the farthest	999
	In the very end of harvest!	999
	Scarcity and want shall shun you;	999
	Ceres' blessing so is on you.	999
	999
FERDINAND	This is a most majestic vision, and	999
	Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold	999
	To think these spirits?	999
	999
PROSPERO	Spirits, which by mine art	999
	I have from their confines call'd to enact	999
	My present fancies.	999
	999
FERDINAND	Let me live here ever;	999
	So rare a wonder'd father and a wife	999
	Makes this place Paradise.	999
	999
	[Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on	999
	employment]	999
	999
PROSPERO	Sweet, now, silence!	999
	Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;	999
	There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,	999
	Or else our spell is marr'd.	999
	999
IRIS	You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,	999
	With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,	999
	Leave your crisp channels and on this green land	999
	Answer your summons; Juno does command:	999
	Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate	999
	A contract of true love; be not too late.	999
	999
	[Enter certain Nymphs]	999
	999
	You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,	999
	Come hither from the furrow and be merry:	999
	Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on	999
	And these fresh nymphs encounter every one	999
	In country footing.	999
	999
	[Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they	999
	join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance;	999
	towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts	999
	suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a	999
	strange, hollow, and confused noise, they	999
	heavily vanish]	999
	999
PROSPERO	[Aside]  I had forgot that foul conspiracy	999
	Of the beast Caliban and his confederates	999
	Against my life: the minute of their plot	999
	Is almost come.	999
	999
	[To the Spirits]	999
	999
	Well done! avoid; no more!	999
	999
FERDINAND	This is strange: your father's in some passion	999
	That works him strongly.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Never till this day	999
	Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.	999
	999
PROSPERO	You do look, my son, in a moved sort,	999
	As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.	999
	Our revels now are ended. These our actors,	999
	As I foretold you, were all spirits and	999
	Are melted into air, into thin air:	999
	And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,	999
	The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,	999
	The solemn temples, the great globe itself,	999
	Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve	999
	And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,	999
	Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff	999
	As dreams are made on, and our little life	999
	Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;	999
	Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:	999
	Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:	999
	If you be pleased, retire into my cell	999
	And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,	999
	To still my beating mind.	999
	999
	999
FERDINAND	|	999
	|  We wish your peace.	999
MIRANDA	|	999
	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
PROSPERO	Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.	999
	999
	[Enter ARIEL]	999
	999
ARIEL	Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?	999
	999
PROSPERO	Spirit,	999
	We must prepare to meet with Caliban.	999
	999
ARIEL	Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,	999
	I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd	999
	Lest I might anger thee.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?	999
	999
ARIEL	I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;	999
	So fun of valour that they smote the air	999
	For breathing in their faces; beat the ground	999
	For kissing of their feet; yet always bending	999
	Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;	999
	At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd	999
	their ears,	999
	Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses	999
	As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears	999
	That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through	999
	Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,	999
	Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them	999
	I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,	999
	There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake	999
	O'erstunk their feet.	999
	999
PROSPERO	This was well done, my bird.	999
	Thy shape invisible retain thou still:	999
	The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,	999
	For stale to catch these thieves.	999
	999
ARIEL	I go, I go.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PROSPERO	A devil, a born devil, on whose nature	999
	Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,	999
	Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;	999
	And as with age his body uglier grows,	999
	So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,	999
	Even to roaring.	999
	999
	[Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, &c]	999
	999
	Come, hang them on this line.	999
	999
	[PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter	999
	CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet]	999
	999
CALIBAN	Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not	999
	Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Monster, your fairy, which you say is	999
	a harmless fairy, has done little better than	999
	played the Jack with us.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at	999
	which my nose is in great indignation.	999
	999
STEPHANO	So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take	999
	a displeasure against you, look you,--	999
	999
TRINCULO	Thou wert but a lost monster.	999
	999
CALIBAN	Good my lord, give me thy favour still.	999
	Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to	999
	Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.	999
	All's hush'd as midnight yet.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--	999
	999
STEPHANO	There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,	999
	monster, but an infinite loss.	999
	999
TRINCULO	That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your	999
	harmless fairy, monster.	999
	999
STEPHANO	I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears	999
	for my labour.	999
	999
CALIBAN	Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,	999
	This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.	999
	Do that good mischief which may make this island	999
	Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,	999
	For aye thy foot-licker.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.	999
	999
TRINCULO	O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look	999
	what a wardrobe here is for thee!	999
	999
CALIBAN	Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.	999
	999
TRINCULO	O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.	999
	O king Stephano!	999
	999
STEPHANO	Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have	999
	that gown.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Thy grace shall have it.	999
	999
CALIBAN	The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean	999
	To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone	999
	And do the murder first: if he awake,	999
	From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,	999
	Make us strange stuff.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,	999
	is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under	999
	the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your	999
	hair and prove a bald jerkin.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.	999
	999
STEPHANO	I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:	999
	wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this	999
	country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent	999
	pass of pate; there's another garment for't.	999
	999
TRINCULO	Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and	999
	away with the rest.	999
	999
CALIBAN	I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,	999
	And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes	999
	With foreheads villanous low.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this	999
	away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you	999
	out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.	999
	999
TRINCULO	And this.	999
	999
STEPHANO	Ay, and this.	999
	999
	[A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits,	999
	in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about,	999
	PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on]	999

PROSPERO	Hey, Mountain, hey!	999

ARIEL	Silver I there it goes, Silver!	999

	999
	[CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are	999
	driven out]	999
	999
	Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints	999
	With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews	999
	With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them	999
	Than pard or cat o' mountain.	999
	999
ARIEL	Hark, they roar!	999
	999
PROSPERO	Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour	999
	Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:	999
	Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou	999

	999
	999
SCENE I	Before PROSPERO'S cell.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL]	999
	999
PROSPERO	Now does my project gather to a head:	999
	My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time	999
	Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?	999
	999
ARIEL	On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,	999
	You said our work should cease.	999
	999
PROSPERO	I did say so,	999
	When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,	999
	How fares the king and's followers?	999
	999
ARIEL	Confined together	999
	In the same fashion as you gave in charge,	999
	Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,	999
	In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;	999
	They cannot budge till your release. The king,	999
	His brother and yours, abide all three distracted	999
	And the remainder mourning over them,	999
	Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly	999
	Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'	999
	His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops	999
	From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em	999
	That if you now beheld them, your affections	999
	Would become tender.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Dost thou think so, spirit?	999
	999
ARIEL	Mine would, sir, were I human.	999
	999
PROSPERO	And mine shall.	999
	Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling	999
	Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,	999
	One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,	999
	Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?	999
	Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,	999
	Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury	999
	Do I take part: the rarer action is	999
	In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,	999
	The sole drift of my purpose doth extend	999
	Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:	999
	My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,	999
	And they shall be themselves.	999
	999
ARIEL	I'll fetch them, sir.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PROSPERO	Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,	999
	And ye that on the sands with printless foot	999
	Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him	999
	When he comes back; you demi-puppets that	999
	By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,	999
	Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime	999
	Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice	999
	To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,	999
	Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd	999
	The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,	999
	And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault	999
	Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder	999
	Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak	999
	With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory	999
	Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up	999
	The pine and cedar: graves at my command	999
	Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth	999
	By my so potent art. But this rough magic	999
	I here abjure, and, when I have required	999
	Some heavenly music, which even now I do,	999
	To work mine end upon their senses that	999
	This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,	999
	Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,	999
	And deeper than did ever plummet sound	999
	I'll drown my book.	999
	999
	[Solemn music]	999
	999
	[Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a	999
	frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO;	999
	SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,	999
	attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all	999
	enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,	999
	and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO	999
	observing, speaks:]	999
	999
	A solemn air and the best comforter	999
	To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,	999
	Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,	999
	For you are spell-stopp'd.	999
	Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,	999
	Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,	999
	Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,	999
	And as the morning steals upon the night,	999
	Melting the darkness, so their rising senses	999
	Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle	999
	Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,	999
	My true preserver, and a loyal sir	999
	To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces	999
	Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly	999
	Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:	999
	Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.	999
	Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,	999
	You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,	999
	Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,	999
	Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,	999
	Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,	999
	Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding	999
	Begins to swell, and the approaching tide	999
	Will shortly fill the reasonable shore	999
	That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them	999
	That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,	999
	Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:	999
	I will discase me, and myself present	999
	As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;	999
	Thou shalt ere long be free.	999
	999
	[ARIEL sings and helps to attire him]	999
	999
	Where the bee sucks. there suck I:	999
	In a cowslip's bell I lie;	999
	There I couch when owls do cry.	999
	On the bat's back I do fly	999
	After summer merrily.	999
	Merrily, merrily shall I live now	999
	Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:	999
	But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.	999
	To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:	999
	There shalt thou find the mariners asleep	999
	Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain	999
	Being awake, enforce them to this place,	999
	And presently, I prithee.	999
	999
ARIEL	I drink the air before me, and return	999
	Or ere your pulse twice beat.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
GONZALO	All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement	999
	Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us	999
	Out of this fearful country!	999
	999
PROSPERO	Behold, sir king,	999
	The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:	999
	For more assurance that a living prince	999
	Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;	999
	And to thee and thy company I bid	999
	A hearty welcome.	999
	999
ALONSO	                  Whether thou best he or no,	999
	Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,	999
	As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse	999
	Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,	999
	The affliction of my mind amends, with which,	999
	I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,	999
	An if this be at all, a most strange story.	999
	Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat	999
	Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero	999
	Be living and be here?	999
	999
PROSPERO	First, noble friend,	999
	Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot	999
	Be measured or confined.	999
	999
GONZALO	Whether this be	999
	Or be not, I'll not swear.	999
	999
PROSPERO	You do yet taste	999
	Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you	999
	Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!	999
	999
	[Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO]	999
	999
	But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,	999
	I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you	999
	And justify you traitors: at this time	999
	I will tell no tales.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	[Aside]  The devil speaks in him.	999
	999
PROSPERO	No.	999
	For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother	999
	Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive	999
	Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require	999
	My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,	999
	Thou must restore.	999
	999
ALONSO	                  If thou be'st Prospero,	999
	Give us particulars of thy preservation;	999
	How thou hast met us here, who three hours since	999
	Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--	999
	How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--	999
	My dear son Ferdinand.	999
	999
PROSPERO	I am woe for't, sir.	999
	999
ALONSO	Irreparable is the loss, and patience	999
	Says it is past her cure.	999
	999
PROSPERO	I rather think	999
	You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace	999
	For the like loss I have her sovereign aid	999
	And rest myself content.	999
	999
ALONSO	You the like loss!	999
	999
PROSPERO	As great to me as late; and, supportable	999
	To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker	999
	Than you may call to comfort you, for I	999
	Have lost my daughter.	999
	999
ALONSO	A daughter?	999
	O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,	999
	The king and queen there! that they were, I wish	999
	Myself were mudded in that oozy bed	999
	Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?	999
	999
PROSPERO	In this last tempest. I perceive these lords	999
	At this encounter do so much admire	999
	That they devour their reason and scarce think	999
	Their eyes do offices of truth, their words	999
	Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have	999
	Been justled from your senses, know for certain	999
	That I am Prospero and that very duke	999
	Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely	999
	Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,	999
	To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;	999
	For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,	999
	Not a relation for a breakfast nor	999
	Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;	999
	This cell's my court: here have I few attendants	999
	And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.	999
	My dukedom since you have given me again,	999
	I will requite you with as good a thing;	999
	At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye	999
	As much as me my dukedom.	999
	999
	[Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA	999
	playing at chess]	999
	999
MIRANDA	Sweet lord, you play me false.	999
	999
FERDINAND	No, my dear'st love,	999
	I would not for the world.	999
	999
MIRANDA	Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,	999
	And I would call it, fair play.	999
	999
ALONSO	If this prove	999
	A vision of the Island, one dear son	999
	Shall I twice lose.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	A most high miracle!	999
	999
FERDINAND	Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;	999
	I have cursed them without cause.	999
	999
	[Kneels]	999
	999
ALONSO	Now all the blessings	999
	Of a glad father compass thee about!	999
	Arise, and say how thou camest here.	999
	999
MIRANDA	O, wonder!	999
	How many goodly creatures are there here!	999
	How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,	999
	That has such people in't!	999
	999
PROSPERO	'Tis new to thee.	999
	999
ALONSO	What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?	999
	Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:	999
	Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,	999
	And brought us thus together?	999
	999
FERDINAND	Sir, she is mortal;	999
	But by immortal Providence she's mine:	999
	I chose her when I could not ask my father	999
	For his advice, nor thought I had one. She	999
	Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,	999
	Of whom so often I have heard renown,	999
	But never saw before; of whom I have	999
	Received a second life; and second father	999
	This lady makes him to me.	999
	999
ALONSO	I am hers:	999
	But, O, how oddly will it sound that I	999
	Must ask my child forgiveness!	999
	999
PROSPERO	There, sir, stop:	999
	Let us not burthen our remembrance with	999
	A heaviness that's gone.	999
	999
GONZALO	I have inly wept,	999
	Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,	999
	And on this couple drop a blessed crown!	999
	For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way	999
	Which brought us hither.	999
	999
ALONSO	I say, Amen, Gonzalo!	999
	999
GONZALO	Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue	999
	Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice	999
	Beyond a common joy, and set it down	999
	With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage	999
	Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,	999
	And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife	999
	Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom	999
	In a poor isle and all of us ourselves	999
	When no man was his own.	999
	999
ALONSO	[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your hands:	999
	Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart	999
	That doth not wish you joy!	999
	999
GONZALO	Be it so! Amen!	999
	999
	[Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain	999
	amazedly following]	999
	999
	O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:	999
	I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,	999
	This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,	999
	That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?	999
	Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?	999
	999
Boatswain	The best news is, that we have safely found	999
	Our king and company; the next, our ship--	999
	Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--	999
	Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when	999
	We first put out to sea.	999
	999
ARIEL	[Aside to PROSPERO]  Sir, all this service	999
	Have I done since I went.	999
	999
PROSPERO	[Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!	999
	999
ALONSO	These are not natural events; they strengthen	999
	From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?	999
	999
Boatswain	If I did think, sir, I were well awake,	999
	I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,	999
	And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;	999
	Where but even now with strange and several noises	999
	Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,	999
	And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,	999
	We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;	999
	Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld	999
	Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master	999
	Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,	999
	Even in a dream, were we divided from them	999
	And were brought moping hither.	999
	999
ARIEL	[Aside to PROSPERO]          Was't well done?	999
	999
PROSPERO	[Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.	999
	999
ALONSO	This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod	999
	And there is in this business more than nature	999
	Was ever conduct of: some oracle	999
	Must rectify our knowledge.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Sir, my liege,	999
	Do not infest your mind with beating on	999
	The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure	999
	Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,	999
	Which to you shall seem probable, of every	999
	These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful	999
	And think of each thing well.	999
	999
	[Aside to ARIEL]	999
	999
		        Come hither, spirit:	999
	Set Caliban and his companions free;	999
	Untie the spell.	999
	999
	[Exit ARIEL]	999
	999
	How fares my gracious sir?	999
	There are yet missing of your company	999
	Some few odd lads that you remember not.	999
	999
	[Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO	999
	and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel]	999
	999
STEPHANO	Every man shift for all the rest, and	999
	let no man take care for himself; for all is	999
	but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!	999
	999
TRINCULO	If these be true spies which I wear in my head,	999
	here's a goodly sight.	999
	999
CALIBAN	O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!	999
	How fine my master is! I am afraid	999
	He will chastise me.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Ha, ha!	999
	What things are these, my lord Antonio?	999
	Will money buy 'em?	999
	999
ANTONIO	Very like; one of them	999
	Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.	999
	999
PROSPERO	Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,	999
	Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,	999
	His mother was a witch, and one so strong	999
	That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,	999
	And deal in her command without her power.	999
	These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--	999
	For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them	999
	To take my life. Two of these fellows you	999
	Must know and own; this thing of darkness!	999
	Acknowledge mine.	999
	999
CALIBAN	                  I shall be pinch'd to death.	999
	999
ALONSO	Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	He is drunk now: where had he wine?	999
	999
ALONSO	And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they	999
	Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?	999
	How camest thou in this pickle?	999
	999
TRINCULO	I have been in such a pickle since I	999
	saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of	999
	my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Why, how now, Stephano!	999
	999
STEPHANO	O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.	999
	999
PROSPERO	You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?	999
	999
STEPHANO	I should have been a sore one then.	999
	999
ALONSO	This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.	999
	999
	[Pointing to Caliban]	999
	999
PROSPERO	He is as disproportion'd in his manners	999
	As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;	999
	Take with you your companions; as you look	999
	To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.	999
	999
CALIBAN	Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter	999
	And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass	999
	Was I, to take this drunkard for a god	999
	And worship this dull fool!	999
	999
PROSPERO	Go to; away!	999
	999
ALONSO	Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Or stole it, rather.	999
	999
	[Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO]	999
	999
PROSPERO	Sir, I invite your highness and your train	999
	To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest	999
	For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste	999
	With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it	999
	Go quick away; the story of my life	999
	And the particular accidents gone by	999
	Since I came to this isle: and in the morn	999
	I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,	999
	Where I have hope to see the nuptial	999
	Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;	999
	And thence retire me to my Milan, where	999
	Every third thought shall be my grave.	999
	999
ALONSO	I long	999
	To hear the story of your life, which must	999
	Take the ear strangely.	999
	999
PROSPERO	I'll deliver all;	999
	And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales	999
	And sail so expeditious that shall catch	999
	Your royal fleet far off.	999
	999
	[Aside to ARIEL]	999
	999
		    My Ariel, chick,	999
	That is thy charge: then to the elements	999
	Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.	999

	THE TEMPEST	999
	999
	EPILOGUE	999
	999
	999
	SPOKEN BY PROSPERO	999
	999
	Now my charms are all o'erthrown,	999
	And what strength I have's mine own,	999
	Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,	999
	I must be here confined by you,	999
	Or sent to Naples. Let me not,	999
	Since I have my dukedom got	999
	And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell	999
	In this bare island by your spell;	999
	But release me from my bands	999
	With the help of your good hands:	999
	Gentle breath of yours my sails	999
	Must fill, or else my project fails,	999
	Which was to please. Now I want	999
	Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,	999
	And my ending is despair,	999
	Unless I be relieved by prayer,	999
	Which pierces so that it assaults	999
	Mercy itself and frees all faults.	999
	As you from crimes would pardon'd be,	999
	Let your indulgence set me free.	999

	999
DUKE ORSINO	If music be the food of love, play on;	999
	Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,	999
	The appetite may sicken, and so die.	999
	That strain again! it had a dying fall:	999
	O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,	999
	That breathes upon a bank of violets,	999
	Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:	999
	'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.	999
	O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,	999
	That, notwithstanding thy capacity	999
	Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,	999
	Of what validity and pitch soe'er,	999
	But falls into abatement and low price,	999
	Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy	999
	That it alone is high fantastical.	999
	999
CURIO	Will you go hunt, my lord?	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	What, Curio?	999
	999
CURIO	The hart.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	        Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:	999
	O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,	999
	Methought she purged the air of pestilence!	999
	That instant was I turn'd into a hart;	999
	And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,	999
	E'er since pursue me.	999
	999
	[Enter VALENTINE]	999
	999
		How now! what news from her?	999
	999
VALENTINE	So please my lord, I might not be admitted;	999
	But from her handmaid do return this answer:	999
	The element itself, till seven years' heat,	999
	Shall not behold her face at ample view;	999
	But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk	999
	And water once a day her chamber round	999
	With eye-offending brine: all this to season	999
	A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh	999
	And lasting in her sad remembrance.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame	999
	To pay this debt of love but to a brother,	999
	How will she love, when the rich golden shaft	999
	Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else	999
	That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,	999
	These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd	999
	Her sweet perfections with one self king!	999
	Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:	999
	Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.	999

	999
VIOLA	What country, friends, is this?	999
	999
Captain	This is Illyria, lady.	999
	999
VIOLA	And what should I do in Illyria?	999
	My brother he is in Elysium.	999
	Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?	999
	999
Captain	It is perchance that you yourself were saved.	999
	999
VIOLA	O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.	999
	999
Captain	True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,	999
	Assure yourself, after our ship did split,	999
	When you and those poor number saved with you	999
	Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,	999
	Most provident in peril, bind himself,	999
	Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,	999
	To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;	999
	Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,	999
	I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves	999
	So long as I could see.	999
	999
VIOLA	For saying so, there's gold:	999
	Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,	999
	Whereto thy speech serves for authority,	999
	The like of him. Know'st thou this country?	999
	999
Captain	Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born	999
	Not three hours' travel from this very place.	999
	999
VIOLA	Who governs here?	999
	999
Captain	A noble duke, in nature as in name.	999
	999
VIOLA	What is the name?	999
	999
Captain	Orsino.	999
	999
VIOLA	Orsino! I have heard my father name him:	999
	He was a bachelor then.	999
	999
Captain	And so is now, or was so very late;	999
	For but a month ago I went from hence,	999
	And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,	999
	What great ones do the less will prattle of,--	999
	That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.	999
	999
VIOLA	What's she?	999
	999
Captain	A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count	999
	That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her	999
	In the protection of his son, her brother,	999
	Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,	999
	They say, she hath abjured the company	999
	And sight of men.	999
	999
VIOLA	                  O that I served that lady	999
	And might not be delivered to the world,	999
	Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,	999
	What my estate is!	999
	999
Captain	That were hard to compass;	999
	Because she will admit no kind of suit,	999
	No, not the duke's.	999
	999
VIOLA	There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;	999
	And though that nature with a beauteous wall	999
	Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee	999
	I will believe thou hast a mind that suits	999
	With this thy fair and outward character.	999
	I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,	999
	Conceal me what I am, and be my aid	999
	For such disguise as haply shall become	999
	The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:	999
	Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:	999
	It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing	999
	And speak to him in many sorts of music	999
	That will allow me very worth his service.	999
	What else may hap to time I will commit;	999
	Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.	999
	999
Captain	Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:	999
	When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.	999
	999

	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	What a plague means my niece, to take the death of	999
	her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.	999
	999
MARIA	By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'	999
	nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great	999
	exceptions to your ill hours.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Why, let her except, before excepted.	999
	999
MARIA	Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest	999
	limits of order.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:	999
	these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be	999
	these boots too: an they be not, let them hang	999
	themselves in their own straps.	999
	999
MARIA	That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard	999
	my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish	999
	knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?	999
	999
MARIA	Ay, he.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.	999
	999
MARIA	What's that to the purpose?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.	999
	999
MARIA	Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:	999
	he's a very fool and a prodigal.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the	999
	viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages	999
	word for word without book, and hath all the good	999
	gifts of nature.	999
	999
MARIA	He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that	999
	he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that	999
	he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he	999
	hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent	999
	he would quickly have the gift of a grave.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors	999
	that say so of him. Who are they?	999
	999
MARIA	They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to	999
	her as long as there is a passage in my throat and	999
	drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill	999
	that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn	999
	o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!	999
	Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR ANDREW]	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Sweet Sir Andrew!	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Bless you, fair shrew.	999
	999
MARIA	And you too, sir.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	What's that?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	My niece's chambermaid.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.	999
	999
MARIA	My name is Mary, sir.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Good Mistress Mary Accost,--	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board	999
	her, woo her, assail her.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	By my troth, I would not undertake her in this	999
	company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?	999
	999
MARIA	Fare you well, gentlemen.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst	999
	never draw sword again.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	An you part so, mistress, I would I might never	999
	draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have	999
	fools in hand?	999
	999
MARIA	Sir, I have not you by the hand.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.	999
	999
MARIA	Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring	999
	your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?	999
	999
MARIA	It's dry, sir.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can	999
	keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?	999
	999
MARIA	A dry jest, sir.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Are you full of them?	999
	999
MARIA	Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,	999
	now I let go your hand, I am barren.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I	999
	see thee so put down?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary	999
	put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit	999
	than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a	999
	great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	No question.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home	999
	to-morrow, Sir Toby.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Pourquoi, my dear knight?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had	999
	bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in	999
	fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but	999
	followed the arts!	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Why, would that have mended my hair?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	But it becomes me well enough, does't not?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I	999
	hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs	999
	and spin it off.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece	999
	will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one	999
	she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above	999
	her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I	999
	have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,	999
	man.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the	999
	strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques	999
	and revels sometimes altogether.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the	999
	degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare	999
	with an old man.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Faith, I can cut a caper.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	And I can cut the mutton to't.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong	999
	as any man in Illyria.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have	999
	these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to	999
	take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost	999
	thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in	999
	a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not	999
	so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What	999
	dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?	999
	I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy	999
	leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a	999
	flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Taurus! That's sides and heart.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the	999
	caper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!	999

VALENTINE	If the duke continue these favours towards you,	999
	Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath	999
	known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.	999
	999
VIOLA	You either fear his humour or my negligence, that	999
	you call in question the continuance of his love:	999
	is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?	999
	999
VALENTINE	No, believe me.	999
	999
VIOLA	I thank you. Here comes the count.	999

	999
DUKE ORSINO	Who saw Cesario, ho?	999
	999
VIOLA	On your attendance, my lord; here.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,	999
	Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd	999
	To thee the book even of my secret soul:	999
	Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;	999
	Be not denied access, stand at her doors,	999
	And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow	999
	Till thou have audience.	999
	999
VIOLA	Sure, my noble lord,	999
	If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow	999
	As it is spoke, she never will admit me.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds	999
	Rather than make unprofited return.	999
	999
VIOLA	Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	O, then unfold the passion of my love,	999
	Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:	999
	It shall become thee well to act my woes;	999
	She will attend it better in thy youth	999
	Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.	999
	999
VIOLA	I think not so, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Dear lad, believe it;	999
	For they shall yet belie thy happy years,	999
	That say thou art a man: Diana's lip	999
	Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe	999
	Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,	999
	And all is semblative a woman's part.	999
	I know thy constellation is right apt	999
	For this affair. Some four or five attend him;	999
	All, if you will; for I myself am best	999
	When least in company. Prosper well in this,	999
	And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,	999
	To call his fortunes thine.	999

	999
MARIA	Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will	999
	not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in	999
	way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.	999
	999
Clown	Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this	999
	world needs to fear no colours.	999
	999
MARIA	Make that good.	999
	999
Clown	He shall see none to fear.	999
	999
MARIA	A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that	999
	saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'	999
	999
Clown	Where, good Mistress Mary?	999
	999
MARIA	In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.	999
	999
Clown	Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those	999
	that are fools, let them use their talents.	999
	999
MARIA	Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,	999
	to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?	999
	999
Clown	Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,	999
	for turning away, let summer bear it out.	999
	999
MARIA	You are resolute, then?	999
	999
Clown	Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.	999
	999
MARIA	That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both	999
	break, your gaskins fall.	999
	999
Clown	Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if	999
	Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a	999
	piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.	999
	999

	lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.	999

	[Exit]	999
	999
Clown	Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!	999
	Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft	999

	pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?	999

	999
Clown	Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:	999
	besides, you grow dishonest.	999
	999
Clown	Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel	999
	will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is	999
	the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend	999
	himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if	999
	he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing	999
	that's mended is but patched: virtue that	999
	transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that	999
	amends is but patched with virtue. If that this	999
	simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,	999
	what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but	999
	calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take	999
	away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Sir, I bade them take away you.	999
	999
Clown	Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non	999
	facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not	999
	motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to	999
	prove you a fool.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Can you do it?	999
	999
Clown	Dexterously, good madonna.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Make your proof.	999
	999
Clown	I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse	999
	of virtue, answer me.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.	999
	999
Clown	Good madonna, why mournest thou?	999
	999
OLIVIA	Good fool, for my brother's death.	999
	999
Clown	I think his soul is in hell, madonna.	999
	999
OLIVIA	I know his soul is in heaven, fool.	999
	999
Clown	The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's	999
	soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.	999
	999
OLIVIA	What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:	999
	infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the	999
	better fool.	999
	999
Clown	God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the	999
	better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be	999
	sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his	999
	word for two pence that you are no fool.	999
	999
OLIVIA	How say you to that, Malvolio?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a	999
	barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day	999
	with an ordinary fool that has no more brain	999
	than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard	999
	already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to	999
	him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,	999
	that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better	999
	than the fools' zanies.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste	999
	with a distempered appetite. To be generous,	999
	guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those	999
	things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:	999
	there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do	999
	nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet	999
	man, though he do nothing but reprove.	999
	999
Clown	Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou	999
	speakest well of fools!	999
	999
	[Re-enter MARIA]	999
	999
MARIA	Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much	999
	desires to speak with you.	999
	999
OLIVIA	From the Count Orsino, is it?	999
	999
MARIA	I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Who of my people hold him in delay?	999
	999
MARIA	Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but	999
	madman: fie on him!	999
	999
	[Exit MARIA]	999
	999
	Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I	999
	am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.	999
	999
	[Exit MALVOLIO]	999
	999
	Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and	999
	people dislike it.	999
	999
Clown	Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest	999
	son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with	999
	brains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has a	999
	most weak pia mater.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH]	999
	999
OLIVIA	By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	A gentleman.	999
	999
OLIVIA	A gentleman! what gentleman?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these	999
	pickle-herring! How now, sot!	999
	999
Clown	Good Sir Toby!	999
	999
OLIVIA	Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Ay, marry, what is he?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give	999
	me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
OLIVIA	What's a drunken man like, fool?	999
	999
Clown	Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one	999
	draught above heat makes him a fool; the second mads	999
	him; and a third drowns him.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my	999
	coz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he's	999
	drowned: go, look after him.	999
	999
Clown	He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look	999
	to the madman.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Re-enter MALVOLIO]	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with	999
	you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to	999
	understand so much, and therefore comes to speak	999
	with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to	999
	have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore	999
	comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,	999
	lady? he's fortified against any denial.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Tell him he shall not speak with me.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your	999
	door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to	999
	a bench, but he'll speak with you.	999
	999
OLIVIA	What kind o' man is he?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Why, of mankind.	999
	999
OLIVIA	What manner of man?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Of what personage and years is he?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for	999
	a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a	999
	cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him	999
	in standing water, between boy and man. He is very	999
	well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one	999
	would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Gentlewoman, my lady calls.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Re-enter MARIA]	999
	999
OLIVIA	Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.	999
	We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.	999
	999
	[Enter VIOLA, and Attendants]	999
	999
VIOLA	The honourable lady of the house, which is she?	999
	999
OLIVIA	Speak to me; I shall answer for her.	999
	Your will?	999
	999
VIOLA	Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I	999
	pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,	999
	for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away	999
	my speech, for besides that it is excellently well	999
	penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good	999
	beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very	999
	comptible, even to the least sinister usage.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Whence came you, sir?	999
	999
VIOLA	I can say little more than I have studied, and that	999
	question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me	999
	modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,	999
	that I may proceed in my speech.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Are you a comedian?	999
	999
VIOLA	No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs	999
	of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you	999
	the lady of the house?	999
	999
OLIVIA	If I do not usurp myself, I am.	999
	999
VIOLA	Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp	999
	yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours	999
	to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will	999
	on with my speech in your praise, and then show you	999
	the heart of my message.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.	999
	999
VIOLA	Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.	999
	999
OLIVIA	It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,	999
	keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,	999
	and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you	999
	than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if	999
	you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of	999
	moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.	999
	999
MARIA	Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.	999
	999
VIOLA	No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little	999
	longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet	999
	lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when	999
	the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.	999
	999
VIOLA	It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of	999
	war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my	999
	hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?	999
	999
VIOLA	The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I	999
	learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I	999
	would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,	999
	divinity, to any other's, profanation.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.	999
	999
	[Exeunt MARIA and Attendants]	999
	999
	Now, sir, what is your text?	999
	999
VIOLA	Most sweet lady,--	999
	999
OLIVIA	A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.	999
	Where lies your text?	999
	999
VIOLA	In Orsino's bosom.	999
	999
OLIVIA	In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?	999
	999
VIOLA	To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.	999
	999
OLIVIA	O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?	999
	999
VIOLA	Good madam, let me see your face.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate	999
	with my face? You are now out of your text: but	999
	we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.	999
	Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't	999
	not well done?	999
	999
	[Unveiling]	999
	999
VIOLA	Excellently done, if God did all.	999
	999
OLIVIA	'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.	999
	999
VIOLA	'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white	999
	Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:	999
	Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,	999
	If you will lead these graces to the grave	999
	And leave the world no copy.	999
	999
OLIVIA	O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give	999
	out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be	999
	inventoried, and every particle and utensil	999
	labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,	999
	indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to	999
	them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were	999
	you sent hither to praise me?	999
	999
VIOLA	I see you what you are, you are too proud;	999
	But, if you were the devil, you are fair.	999
	My lord and master loves you: O, such love	999
	Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd	999
	The nonpareil of beauty!	999
	999
OLIVIA	How does he love me?	999
	999
VIOLA	With adorations, fertile tears,	999
	With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:	999
	Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,	999
	Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;	999
	In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;	999
	And in dimension and the shape of nature	999
	A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;	999
	He might have took his answer long ago.	999
	999
VIOLA	If I did love you in my master's flame,	999
	With such a suffering, such a deadly life,	999
	In your denial I would find no sense;	999
	I would not understand it.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Why, what would you?	999
	999
VIOLA	Make me a willow cabin at your gate,	999
	And call upon my soul within the house;	999
	Write loyal cantons of contemned love	999
	And sing them loud even in the dead of night;	999
	Halloo your name to the reverberate hills	999
	And make the babbling gossip of the air	999
	Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest	999
	Between the elements of air and earth,	999
	But you should pity me!	999
	999
OLIVIA	You might do much.	999
	What is your parentage?	999
	999
VIOLA	Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:	999
	I am a gentleman.	999
	999
OLIVIA	                  Get you to your lord;	999
	I cannot love him: let him send no more;	999
	Unless, perchance, you come to me again,	999
	To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:	999
	I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.	999
	999
VIOLA	I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:	999
	My master, not myself, lacks recompense.	999
	Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;	999
	And let your fervor, like my master's, be	999
	Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
OLIVIA	'What is your parentage?'	999
	'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:	999
	I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;	999
	Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,	999
	Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:	999
	soft, soft!	999
	Unless the master were the man. How now!	999
	Even so quickly may one catch the plague?	999
	Methinks I feel this youth's perfections	999
	With an invisible and subtle stealth	999
	To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.	999
	What ho, Malvolio!	999
	999
	[Re-enter MALVOLIO]	999
	999
MALVOLIO	                  Here, madam, at your service.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Run after that same peevish messenger,	999
	The county's man: he left this ring behind him,	999
	Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.	999
	Desire him not to flatter with his lord,	999
	Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:	999
	If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,	999
	I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Madam, I will.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
OLIVIA	I do I know not what, and fear to find	999
	Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.	999
	Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;	999
	What is decreed must be, and be this so.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The sea-coast.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN]	999
	999
ANTONIO	Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over	999
	me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps	999
	distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your	999
	leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad	999
	recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.	999
	999
ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere	999
	extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a	999
	touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me	999
	what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges	999
	me in manners the rather to express myself. You	999
	must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,	999
	which I called Roderigo. My father was that	999
	Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard	999
	of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both	999
	born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,	999
	would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;	999
	for some hour before you took me from the breach of	999
	the sea was my sister drowned.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Alas the day!	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled	999
	me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,	999
	though I could not with such estimable wonder	999
	overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly	999
	publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but	999
	call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt	999
	water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.	999
	999
ANTONIO	If you will not murder me for my love, let me be	999
	your servant.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	If you will not undo what you have done, that is,	999
	kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.	999
	Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,	999
	and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that	999
	upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell	999
	tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ANTONIO	The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!	999
	I have many enemies in Orsino's court,	999
	Else would I very shortly see thee there.	999
	But, come what may, I do adore thee so,	999
	That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.	999

	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following]	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?	999
	999
VIOLA	Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since	999
	arrived but hither.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have	999
	saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.	999
	She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord	999
	into a desperate assurance she will none of him:	999
	and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to	999
	come again in his affairs, unless it be to report	999
	your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.	999
	999
VIOLA	She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her	999
	will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth	999
	stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be	999
	it his that finds it.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
VIOLA	I left no ring with her: what means this lady?	999
	Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!	999
	She made good view of me; indeed, so much,	999
	That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,	999
	For she did speak in starts distractedly.	999
	She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion	999
	Invites me in this churlish messenger.	999
	None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.	999
	I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,	999
	Poor lady, she were better love a dream.	999
	Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,	999
	Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.	999
	How easy is it for the proper-false	999
	In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!	999
	Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!	999
	For such as we are made of, such we be.	999
	How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;	999
	And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;	999
	And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.	999
	What will become of this? As I am man,	999
	My state is desperate for my master's love;	999
	As I am woman,--now alas the day!--	999
	What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!	999
	O time! thou must untangle this, not I;	999
	It is too hard a knot for me to untie!	999

SCENE III	OLIVIA's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed after	999
	midnight is to be up betimes; and 'diluculo	999
	surgere,' thou know'st,--	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know, to be up	999
	late is to be up late.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.	999
	To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is	999
	early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go	999
	to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the	999
	four elements?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists	999
	of eating and drinking.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.	999
	Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!	999
	999
	[Enter Clown]	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Here comes the fool, i' faith.	999
	999
Clown	How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture	999
	of 'we three'?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I	999
	had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,	999
	and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In	999
	sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last	999
	night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the	999
	Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas	999
	very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy	999
	leman: hadst it?	999
	999
Clown	I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose	999
	is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the	999
	Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all	999
	is done. Now, a song.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--	999
	999
Clown	Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	A love-song, a love-song.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Ay, ay: I care not for good life.	999
	999
Clown	[Sings]	999
	999
	O mistress mine, where are you roaming?	999
	O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,	999
	That can sing both high and low:	999
	Trip no further, pretty sweeting;	999
	Journeys end in lovers meeting,	999
	Every wise man's son doth know.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Excellent good, i' faith.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Good, good.	999
	999
Clown	[Sings]	999
	999
	What is love? 'tis not hereafter;	999
	Present mirth hath present laughter;	999
	What's to come is still unsure:	999
	In delay there lies no plenty;	999
	Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,	999
	Youth's a stuff will not endure.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	A contagious breath.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.	999
	But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? shall we	999
	rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three	999
	souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.	999
	999
Clown	By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'	999
	999
Clown	'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall be	999
	constrained in't to call thee knave, knight.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to	999
	call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'	999
	999
Clown	I shall never begin if I hold my peace.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Good, i' faith. Come, begin.	999
	999
	[Catch sung]	999
	999
	[Enter MARIA]	999
	999
MARIA	What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady	999
	have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him	999
	turn you out of doors, never trust me.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's	999
	a Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.' Am not	999
	I consanguineous? am I not of her blood?	999
	Tillyvally. Lady!	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'	999
	999
Clown	Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do	999
	I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it	999
	more natural.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	[Sings]  'O, the twelfth day of December,'--	999
	999
MARIA	For the love o' God, peace!	999
	999
	[Enter MALVOLIO]	999
	999
MALVOLIO	My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have ye	999
	no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like	999
	tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an	999
	alehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your	999
	coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse	999
	of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor	999
	time in you?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me	999
	tell you, that, though she harbours you as her	999
	kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If	999
	you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you	999
	are welcome to the house; if not, an it would please	999
	you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid	999
	you farewell.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'	999
	999
MARIA	Nay, good Sir Toby.	999
	999
Clown	'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Is't even so?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	'But I will never die.'	999
	999
Clown	Sir Toby, there you lie.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	This is much credit to you.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	'Shall I bid him go?'	999
	999
Clown	'What an if you do?'	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'	999
	999
Clown	'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than a	999
	steward? Dost thou think, because thou art	999
	virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?	999
	999
Clown	Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the	999
	mouth too.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with	999
	crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at any	999
	thing more than contempt, you would not give means	999
	for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
MARIA	Go shake your ears.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's	999
	a-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then to	999
	break promise with him and make a fool of him.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'll	999
	deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.	999
	999
MARIA	Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight: since the	999
	youth of the count's was today with thy lady, she is	999
	much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me	999
	alone with him: if I do not gull him into a	999
	nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not	999
	think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:	999
	I know I can do it.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.	999
	999
MARIA	Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,	999
	dear knight?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason	999
	good enough.	999
	999
MARIA	The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing	999
	constantly, but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,	999
	that cons state without book and utters it by great	999
	swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so	999
	crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is	999
	his grounds of faith that all that look on him love	999
	him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find	999
	notable cause to work.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	What wilt thou do?	999
	999
MARIA	I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of	999
	love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape	999
	of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure	999
	of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find	999
	himself most feelingly personated. I can write very	999
	like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we	999
	can hardly make distinction of our hands.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Excellent! I smell a device.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	I have't in my nose too.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,	999
	that they come from my niece, and that she's in	999
	love with him.	999
	999
MARIA	My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	And your horse now would make him an ass.	999
	999
MARIA	Ass, I doubt not.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	O, 'twill be admirable!	999
	999
MARIA	Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic will	999
	work with him. I will plant you two, and let the	999
	fool make a third, where he shall find the letter:	999
	observe his construction of it. For this night, to	999
	bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Good night, Penthesilea.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Before me, she's a good wench.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me:	999
	what o' that?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	I was adored once too.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for	999
	more money.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i'	999
	the end, call me cut.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late	999
	to go to bed now: come, knight; come, knight.	999

SCENE IV	DUKE ORSINO's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and others]	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.	999
	Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,	999
	That old and antique song we heard last night:	999
	Methought it did relieve my passion much,	999
	More than light airs and recollected terms	999
	Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:	999
	Come, but one verse.	999
	999
CURIO	He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Who was it?	999
	999
CURIO	Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady	999
	Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Seek him out, and play the tune the while.	999
	999
	[Exit CURIO. Music plays]	999
	999
	Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,	999
	In the sweet pangs of it remember me;	999
	For such as I am all true lovers are,	999
	Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,	999
	Save in the constant image of the creature	999
	That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?	999
	999
VIOLA	It gives a very echo to the seat	999
	Where Love is throned.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Thou dost speak masterly:	999
	My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye	999
	Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:	999
	Hath it not, boy?	999
	999
VIOLA	                  A little, by your favour.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	What kind of woman is't?	999
	999
VIOLA	Of your complexion.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?	999
	999
VIOLA	About your years, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Too old by heaven: let still the woman take	999
	An elder than herself: so wears she to him,	999
	So sways she level in her husband's heart:	999
	For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,	999
	Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,	999
	More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,	999
	Than women's are.	999
	999
VIOLA	                  I think it well, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Then let thy love be younger than thyself,	999
	Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;	999
	For women are as roses, whose fair flower	999
	Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.	999
	999
VIOLA	And so they are: alas, that they are so;	999
	To die, even when they to perfection grow!	999
	999
	[Re-enter CURIO and Clown]	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.	999
	Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;	999
	The spinsters and the knitters in the sun	999
	And the free maids that weave their thread with bones	999
	Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,	999
	And dallies with the innocence of love,	999
	Like the old age.	999
	999
Clown	Are you ready, sir?	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Ay; prithee, sing.	999
	999
	[Music]	999
		999
	SONG.	999
Clown	Come away, come away, death,	999
	And in sad cypress let me be laid;	999
	Fly away, fly away breath;	999
	I am slain by a fair cruel maid.	999
	My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,	999
	O, prepare it!	999
	My part of death, no one so true	999
	Did share it.	999
	Not a flower, not a flower sweet	999
	On my black coffin let there be strown;	999
	Not a friend, not a friend greet	999
	My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:	999
	A thousand thousand sighs to save,	999
	Lay me, O, where	999
	Sad true lover never find my grave,	999
	To weep there!	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	There's for thy pains.	999
	999
Clown	No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	I'll pay thy pleasure then.	999
	999
Clown	Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Give me now leave to leave thee.	999
	999
Clown	Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the	999
	tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for	999
	thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such	999
	constancy put to sea, that their business might be	999
	every thing and their intent every where; for that's	999
	it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Let all the rest give place.	999
	999
	[CURIO and Attendants retire]	999
	999
		       Once more, Cesario,	999
	Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:	999
	Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,	999
	Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;	999
	The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,	999
	Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;	999
	But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems	999
	That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.	999
	999
VIOLA	But if she cannot love you, sir?	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	I cannot be so answer'd.	999
	999
VIOLA	Sooth, but you must.	999
	Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,	999
	Hath for your love a great a pang of heart	999
	As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;	999
	You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	There is no woman's sides	999
	Can bide the beating of so strong a passion	999
	As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart	999
	So big, to hold so much; they lack retention	999
	Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,	999
	No motion of the liver, but the palate,	999
	That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;	999
	But mine is all as hungry as the sea,	999
	And can digest as much: make no compare	999
	Between that love a woman can bear me	999
	And that I owe Olivia.	999
	999
VIOLA	Ay, but I know--	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	What dost thou know?	999
	999
VIOLA	Too well what love women to men may owe:	999
	In faith, they are as true of heart as we.	999
	My father had a daughter loved a man,	999
	As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,	999
	I should your lordship.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	And what's her history?	999
	999
VIOLA	A blank, my lord. She never told her love,	999
	But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,	999
	Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,	999
	And with a green and yellow melancholy	999
	She sat like patience on a monument,	999
	Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?	999
	We men may say more, swear more: but indeed	999
	Our shows are more than will; for still we prove	999
	Much in our vows, but little in our love.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	But died thy sister of her love, my boy?	999
	999
VIOLA	I am all the daughters of my father's house,	999
	And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.	999
	Sir, shall I to this lady?	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Ay, that's the theme.	999
	To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,	999
	My love can give no place, bide no denay.	999

	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.	999
	999
FABIAN	Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,	999
	let me be boiled to death with melancholy.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly	999
	rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?	999
	999
FABIAN	I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'	999
	favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will	999
	fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	An we do not, it is pity of our lives.	999

	How now, my metal of India!	999

MARIA	Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's	999
	coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the	999
	sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half	999
	hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I	999
	know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of	999
	him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,	999

MALVOLIO	'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told	999
	me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come	999
	thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one	999
	of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more	999
	exalted respect than any one else that follows her.	999
	What should I think on't?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Here's an overweening rogue!	999
	999
FABIAN	O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock	999
	of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Peace, I say.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	To be Count Malvolio!	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Ah, rogue!	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Pistol him, pistol him.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Peace, peace!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy	999
	married the yeoman of the wardrobe.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Fie on him, Jezebel!	999
	999
FABIAN	O, peace! now he's deeply in: look how	999
	imagination blows him.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Having been three months married to her, sitting in	999
	my state,--	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet	999
	gown; having come from a day-bed, where I have left	999
	Olivia sleeping,--	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Fire and brimstone!	999
	999
FABIAN	O, peace, peace!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	And then to have the humour of state; and after a	999
	demure travel of regard, telling them I know my	999
	place as I would they should do theirs, to for my	999
	kinsman Toby,--	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Bolts and shackles!	999
	999
FABIAN	O peace, peace, peace! now, now.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make	999
	out for him: I frown the while; and perchance wind	999
	up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby	999
	approaches; courtesies there to me,--	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Shall this fellow live?	999
	999
FABIAN	Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar	999
	smile with an austere regard of control,--	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on	999
	your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	What, what?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	'You must amend your drunkenness.'	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Out, scab!	999
	999
FABIAN	Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with	999
	a foolish knight,'--	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	That's me, I warrant you.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	'One Sir Andrew,'--	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	What employment have we here?	999
	999
	[Taking up the letter]	999
	999
FABIAN	Now is the woodcock near the gin.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading	999
	aloud to him!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her	999
	very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her	999
	great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	[Reads]  'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good	999
	wishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave, wax.	999
	Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she	999
	uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?	999
	999
FABIAN	This wins him, liver and all.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	[Reads]	999
	999
	Jove knows I love: But who?	999
	Lips, do not move;	999
	No man must know.	999
	'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers	999
	altered! 'No man must know:' if this should be	999
	thee, Malvolio?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Marry, hang thee, brock!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	[Reads]	999
	I may command where I adore;	999
	But silence, like a Lucrece knife,	999
	With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:	999
	M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.	999
	999
FABIAN	A fustian riddle!	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Excellent wench, say I.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let	999
	me see, let me see, let me see.	999
	999
FABIAN	What dish o' poison has she dressed him!	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command	999
	me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is	999
	evident to any formal capacity; there is no	999
	obstruction in this: and the end,--what should	999
	that alphabetical position portend? If I could make	999
	that resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,	999
	I,--	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.	999
	999
FABIAN	Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as	999
	rank as a fox.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.	999
	999
FABIAN	Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is	999
	excellent at faults.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;	999
	that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.	999
	999
FABIAN	And O shall end, I hope.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	And then I comes behind.	999
	999
FABIAN	Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see	999
	more detraction at your heels than fortunes before	999
	you.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and	999
	yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for	999
	every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!	999
	here follows prose.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I	999
	am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some	999
	are born great, some achieve greatness, and some	999
	have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open	999
	their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;	999
	and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,	999
	cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be	999
	opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let	999
	thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into	999
	the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee	999
	that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy	999
	yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever	999
	cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art	999
	made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see	999
	thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and	999
	not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.	999
	She that would alter services with thee,	999
		         THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'	999
	Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is	999
	open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,	999
	I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross	999
	acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.	999
	I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade	999
	me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady	999
	loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of	999
	late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;	999
	and in this she manifests herself to my love, and	999
	with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits	999
	of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will	999
	be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and	999
	cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting	999
	on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a	999
	postscript.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou	999
	entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;	999
	thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my	999
	presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'	999
	Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do	999
	everything that thou wilt have me.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FABIAN	I will not give my part of this sport for a pension	999
	of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	I could marry this wench for this device.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	So could I too.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Nor I neither.	999
	999
FABIAN	Here comes my noble gull-catcher.	999
	999
	[Re-enter MARIA]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Or o' mine either?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Shall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thy	999
	bond-slave?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	I' faith, or I either?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when	999
	the image of it leaves him he must run mad.	999
	999
MARIA	Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.	999
	999
MARIA	If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark	999
	his first approach before my lady: he will come to	999
	her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she	999
	abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;	999
	and he will smile upon her, which will now be so	999
	unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a	999
	melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him	999
	into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow	999
	me.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!	999

SIR ANDREW	I'll make one too.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	OLIVIA's garden.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabour]	999
	999
VIOLA	Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by	999
	thy tabour?	999
	999
Clown	No, sir, I live by the church.	999
	999
VIOLA	Art thou a churchman?	999
	999
Clown	No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for	999
	I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by	999
	the church.	999
	999
VIOLA	So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a	999
	beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy	999
	tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.	999
	999
Clown	You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is	999
	but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the	999
	wrong side may be turned outward!	999
	999
VIOLA	Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with	999
	words may quickly make them wanton.	999
	999
Clown	I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.	999
	999
VIOLA	Why, man?	999
	999
Clown	Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that	999
	word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words	999
	are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.	999
	999
VIOLA	Thy reason, man?	999
	999
Clown	Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and	999
	words are grown so false, I am loath to prove	999
	reason with them.	999
	999
VIOLA	I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.	999
	999
Clown	Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my	999
	conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be	999
	to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.	999
	999
VIOLA	Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?	999
	999
Clown	No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she	999
	will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and	999
	fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to	999
	herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not	999
	her fool, but her corrupter of words.	999
	999
VIOLA	I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.	999
	999
Clown	Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,	999
	it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but	999
	the fool should be as oft with your master as with	999
	my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.	999
	999
VIOLA	Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.	999
	Hold, there's expenses for thee.	999
	999
Clown	Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!	999
	999
VIOLA	By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for	999
	one;	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy	999
	lady within?	999
	999
Clown	Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?	999
	999
VIOLA	Yes, being kept together and put to use.	999
	999
Clown	I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring	999
	a Cressida to this Troilus.	999
	999
VIOLA	I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.	999
	999
Clown	The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but	999
	a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is	999
	within, sir. I will construe to them whence you	999
	come; who you are and what you would are out of my	999
	welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
VIOLA	This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;	999
	And to do that well craves a kind of wit:	999
	He must observe their mood on whom he jests,	999
	The quality of persons, and the time,	999
	And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather	999
	That comes before his eye. This is a practise	999
	As full of labour as a wise man's art	999
	For folly that he wisely shows is fit;	999
	But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Save you, gentleman.	999
	999
VIOLA	And you, sir.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Dieu vous garde, monsieur.	999
	999
VIOLA	Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous	999
	you should enter, if your trade be to her.	999
	999
VIOLA	I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the	999
	list of my voyage.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.	999
	999
VIOLA	My legs do better understand me, sir, than I	999
	understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	I mean, to go, sir, to enter.	999
	999
VIOLA	I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we	999
	are prevented.	999
	999
	[Enter OLIVIA and MARIA]	999
	999
	Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain	999
	odours on you!	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.	999
	999
VIOLA	My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant	999
	and vouchsafed ear.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em	999
	all three all ready.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.	999
	999
	[Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and MARIA]	999
	999
	Give me your hand, sir.	999
	999
VIOLA	My duty, madam, and most humble service.	999
	999
OLIVIA	What is your name?	999
	999
VIOLA	Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.	999
	999
OLIVIA	My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world	999
	Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:	999
	You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.	999
	999
VIOLA	And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:	999
	Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.	999
	999
OLIVIA	For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,	999
	Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!	999
	999
VIOLA	Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts	999
	On his behalf.	999
	999
OLIVIA	                  O, by your leave, I pray you,	999
	I bade you never speak again of him:	999
	But, would you undertake another suit,	999
	I had rather hear you to solicit that	999
	Than music from the spheres.	999
	999
VIOLA	Dear lady,--	999
	999
OLIVIA	Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,	999
	After the last enchantment you did here,	999
	A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse	999
	Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:	999
	Under your hard construction must I sit,	999
	To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,	999
	Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?	999
	Have you not set mine honour at the stake	999
	And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts	999
	That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving	999
	Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,	999
	Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.	999
	999
VIOLA	I pity you.	999
	999
OLIVIA	          That's a degree to love.	999
	999
VIOLA	No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,	999
	That very oft we pity enemies.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.	999
	O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!	999
	If one should be a prey, how much the better	999
	To fall before the lion than the wolf!	999
	999
	[Clock strikes]	999
	999
	The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.	999
	Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:	999
	And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,	999
	Your were is alike to reap a proper man:	999
	There lies your way, due west.	999
	999
VIOLA	Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition	999
	Attend your ladyship!	999
	You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?	999
	999
OLIVIA	Stay:	999
	I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.	999
	999
VIOLA	That you do think you are not what you are.	999
	999
OLIVIA	If I think so, I think the same of you.	999
	999
VIOLA	Then think you right: I am not what I am.	999
	999
OLIVIA	I would you were as I would have you be!	999
	999
VIOLA	Would it be better, madam, than I am?	999
	I wish it might, for now I am your fool.	999
	999
OLIVIA	O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful	999
	In the contempt and anger of his lip!	999
	A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon	999
	Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.	999
	Cesario, by the roses of the spring,	999
	By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,	999
	I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,	999
	Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.	999
	Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,	999
	For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,	999
	But rather reason thus with reason fetter,	999
	Love sought is good, but given unsought better.	999
	999
VIOLA	By innocence I swear, and by my youth	999
	I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,	999
	And that no woman has; nor never none	999
	Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.	999
	And so adieu, good madam: never more	999
	Will I my master's tears to you deplore.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move	999
	That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.	999

	count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;	999
	I saw't i' the orchard.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	As plain as I see you now.	999
	999
FABIAN	This was a great argument of love in her toward you.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?	999
	999
FABIAN	I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of	999
	judgment and reason.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah	999
	was a sailor.	999
	999
FABIAN	She did show favour to the youth in your sight only	999
	to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to	999
	put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.	999
	You should then have accosted her; and with some	999
	excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should	999
	have banged the youth into dumbness. This was	999
	looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the	999
	double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash	999
	off, and you are now sailed into the north of my	999
	lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle	999
	on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by	999
	some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	An't be any way, it must be with valour; for policy	999
	I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a	999
	politician.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of	999
	valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight	999
	with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall	999
	take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no	999
	love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's	999
	commendation with woman than report of valour.	999
	999
FABIAN	There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;	999
	it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun	999
	of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:	999
	if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be	999
	amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of	999
	paper, although the sheet were big enough for the	999
	bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.	999
	Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou	999
	write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Where shall I find you?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.	999
	999
	[Exit SIR ANDREW]	999
	999
FABIAN	This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand	999
	strong, or so.	999
	999
FABIAN	We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll	999
	not deliver't?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the	999
	youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes	999
	cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were	999
	opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as	999
	will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of	999
	the anatomy.	999
	999
FABIAN	And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no	999
	great presage of cruelty.	999
	999
	[Enter MARIA]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.	999
	999
MARIA	If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself	999
	into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is	999
	turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no	999
	Christian, that means to be saved by believing	999
	rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages	999
	of grossness. He's in yellow stockings.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	And cross-gartered?	999
	999
MARIA	Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school	999
	i' the church. I have dogged him, like his	999
	murderer. He does obey every point of the letter	999
	that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his	999
	face into more lines than is in the new map with the	999
	augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such	999
	a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things	999
	at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,	999
	he'll smile and take't for a great favour.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Come, bring us, bring us where he is.	999

SCENE III	A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO]	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	I would not by my will have troubled you;	999
	But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,	999
	I will no further chide you.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I could not stay behind you: my desire,	999
	More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;	999
	And not all love to see you, though so much	999
	As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,	999
	But jealousy what might befall your travel,	999
	Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,	999
	Unguided and unfriended, often prove	999
	Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,	999
	The rather by these arguments of fear,	999
	Set forth in your pursuit.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	My kind Antonio,	999
	I can no other answer make but thanks,	999
	And thanks; and ever [         ] oft good turns	999
	Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:	999
	But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,	999
	You should find better dealing. What's to do?	999
	Shall we go see the reliques of this town?	999
	999
ANTONIO	To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:	999
	I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes	999
	With the memorials and the things of fame	999
	That do renown this city.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Would you'ld pardon me;	999
	I do not without danger walk these streets:	999
	Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys	999
	I did some service; of such note indeed,	999
	That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Belike you slew great number of his people.	999
	999
ANTONIO	The offence is not of such a bloody nature;	999
	Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel	999
	Might well have given us bloody argument.	999
	It might have since been answer'd in repaying	999
	What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,	999
	Most of our city did: only myself stood out;	999
	For which, if I be lapsed in this place,	999
	I shall pay dear.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	                  Do not then walk too open.	999
	999
ANTONIO	It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.	999
	In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,	999
	Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,	999
	Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge	999
	With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Why I your purse?	999
	999
ANTONIO	Haply your eye shall light upon some toy	999
	You have desire to purchase; and your store,	999
	I think, is not for idle markets, sir.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you	999
	For an hour.	999
	999
ANTONIO	To the Elephant.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	                  I do remember.	999

SCENE IV	OLIVIA's garden.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter OLIVIA and MARIA]	999
	999
OLIVIA	I have sent after him: he says he'll come;	999
	How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?	999
	For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.	999
	I speak too loud.	999
	Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,	999
	And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:	999
	Where is Malvolio?	999
	999
MARIA	He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He	999
	is, sure, possessed, madam.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Why, what's the matter? does he rave?	999
	999
MARIA	No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your	999
	ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if	999
	he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Go call him hither.	999
	999
	[Exit MARIA]	999
	999
	I am as mad as he,	999
	If sad and merry madness equal be.	999
	999
	[Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO]	999
	999
	How now, Malvolio!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Sweet lady, ho, ho.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Smilest thou?	999
	I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some	999
	obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but	999
	what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is	999
	with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and	999
	please all.'	999
	999
OLIVIA	Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It	999
	did come to his hands, and commands shall be	999
	executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.	999
	999
OLIVIA	God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss	999
	thy hand so oft?	999
	999
MARIA	How do you, Malvolio?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.	999
	999
MARIA	Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.	999
	999
OLIVIA	What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	'Some are born great,'--	999
	999
OLIVIA	Ha!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	'Some achieve greatness,'--	999
	999
OLIVIA	What sayest thou?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'	999
	999
OLIVIA	Heaven restore thee!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	'Remember who commended thy yellow stockings,'--	999
	999
OLIVIA	Thy yellow stockings!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'	999
	999
OLIVIA	Cross-gartered!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--	999
	999
OLIVIA	Am I made?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'	999
	999
OLIVIA	Why, this is very midsummer madness.	999
	999
	[Enter Servant]	999
	999
Servant	Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is	999
	returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he	999
	attends your ladyship's pleasure.	999
	999
OLIVIA	I'll come to him.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant]	999
	999
	Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's	999
	my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special	999
	care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the	999
	half of my dowry.	999
	999
	[Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA]	999
	999
MALVOLIO	O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than	999
	Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with	999
	the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may	999
	appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that	999
	in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;	999
	'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;	999
	let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put	999
	thyself into the trick of singularity;' and	999
	consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad	999
	face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the	999
	habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have	999
	limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me	999
	thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this	999
	fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor	999
	after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing	999
	adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no	999
	scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous	999
	or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing	999
	that can be can come between me and the full	999
	prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the	999
	doer of this, and he is to be thanked.	999
	999
	[Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all	999
	the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion	999
	himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.	999
	999
FABIAN	Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?	999
	how is't with you, man?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go	999
	off.	999
	999
MARIA	Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not	999
	I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a	999
	care of him.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Ah, ha! does she so?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently	999
	with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how	999
	is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:	999
	consider, he's an enemy to mankind.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Do you know what you say?	999
	999
MARIA	La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes	999
	it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!	999
	999
FABIAN	Carry his water to the wise woman.	999
	999
MARIA	Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I	999
	live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	How now, mistress!	999
	999
MARIA	O Lord!	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do	999
	you not see you move him? let me alone with him.	999
	999
FABIAN	No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is	999
	rough, and will not be roughly used.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Sir!	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for	999
	gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang	999
	him, foul collier!	999
	999
MARIA	Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	My prayers, minx!	999
	999
MARIA	No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow	999
	things: I am not of your element: you shall know	999
	more hereafter.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Is't possible?	999
	999
FABIAN	If this were played upon a stage now, I could	999
	condemn it as an improbable fiction.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.	999
	999
MARIA	Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.	999
	999
FABIAN	Why, we shall make him mad indeed.	999
	999
MARIA	The house will be the quieter.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My	999
	niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we	999
	may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,	999
	till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt	999
	us to have mercy on him: at which time we will	999
	bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a	999
	finder of madmen. But see, but see.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR ANDREW]	999
	999
FABIAN	More matter for a May morning.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's	999
	vinegar and pepper in't.	999
	999
FABIAN	Is't so saucy?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Give me.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'	999
	999
FABIAN	Good, and valiant.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	[Reads]  'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,	999
	why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'	999
	999
FABIAN	A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	[Reads]  'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my	999
	sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy	999
	throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'	999
	999
FABIAN	Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	[Reads]  'I will waylay thee going home; where if it	999
	be thy chance to kill me,'--	999
	999
FABIAN	Good.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	[Reads]  'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'	999
	999
FABIAN	Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	[Reads]  'Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon	999
	one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but	999
	my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy	999
	friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,	999
		                  ANDREW AGUECHEEK.	999
	If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:	999
	I'll give't him.	999
	999
MARIA	You may have very fit occasion for't: he is now in	999
	some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the	999
	orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest	999
	him, draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible; for	999
	it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a	999
	swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood	999
	more approbation than ever proof itself would have	999
	earned him. Away!	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Nay, let me alone for swearing.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behavior	999
	of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good	999
	capacity and breeding; his employment between his	999
	lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this	999
	letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no	999
	terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a	999
	clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by	999
	word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report	999
	of valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know his	999
	youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous	999
	opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.	999
	This will so fright them both that they will kill	999
	one another by the look, like cockatrices.	999
	999
	[Re-enter OLIVIA, with VIOLA]	999
	999
FABIAN	Here he comes with your niece: give them way till	999
	he take leave, and presently after him.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	I will meditate the while upon some horrid message	999
	for a challenge.	999
	999
	[Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, FABIAN, and MARIA]	999
	999
OLIVIA	I have said too much unto a heart of stone	999
	And laid mine honour too unchary out:	999
	There's something in me that reproves my fault;	999
	But such a headstrong potent fault it is,	999
	That it but mocks reproof.	999
	999
VIOLA	With the same 'havior that your passion bears	999
	Goes on my master's grief.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;	999
	Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;	999
	And I beseech you come again to-morrow.	999
	What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,	999
	That honour saved may upon asking give?	999
	999
VIOLA	Nothing but this; your true love for my master.	999
	999
OLIVIA	How with mine honour may I give him that	999
	Which I have given to you?	999
	999
VIOLA	I will acquit you.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:	999
	A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Gentleman, God save thee.	999
	999
VIOLA	And you, sir.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what	999
	nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know	999
	not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as	999
	the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:	999
	dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for	999
	thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.	999
	999
VIOLA	You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel	999
	to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from	999
	any image of offence done to any man.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,	999
	if you hold your life at any price, betake you to	999
	your guard; for your opposite hath in him what	999
	youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.	999
	999
VIOLA	I pray you, sir, what is he?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on	999
	carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private	999
	brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and	999
	his incensement at this moment is so implacable,	999
	that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death	999
	and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.	999
	999
VIOLA	I will return again into the house and desire some	999
	conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard	999
	of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on	999
	others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man	999
	of that quirk.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a	999
	very competent injury: therefore, get you on and	999
	give him his desire. Back you shall not to the	999
	house, unless you undertake that with me which with	999
	as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,	999
	or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you	999
	must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.	999
	999
VIOLA	This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me	999
	this courteous office, as to know of the knight what	999
	my offence to him is: it is something of my	999
	negligence, nothing of my purpose.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this	999
	gentleman till my return.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
VIOLA	Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?	999
	999
FABIAN	I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a	999
	mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.	999
	999
VIOLA	I beseech you, what manner of man is he?	999
	999
FABIAN	Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by	999
	his form, as you are like to find him in the proof	999
	of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,	999
	bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly	999
	have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk	999
	towards him? I will make your peace with him if I	999
	can.	999
	999
VIOLA	I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that	999
	had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I	999
	care not who knows so much of my mettle.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a	999
	firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and	999
	all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal	999
	motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he	999
	pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they	999
	step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can	999
	scarce hold him yonder.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so	999
	cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld	999
	have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,	999
	and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show	999
	on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.	999
	999
	[Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA]	999
	999
	[To FABIAN]	999
	999
	I have his horse to take up the quarrel:	999
	I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.	999
	999
FABIAN	He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and	999
	looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	[To VIOLA]  There's no remedy, sir; he will fight	999
	with you for's oath sake: marry, he hath better	999
	bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now	999
	scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for	999
	the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.	999
	999
VIOLA	[Aside]  Pray God defend me! A little thing would	999
	make me tell them how much I lack of a man.	999
	999
FABIAN	Give ground, if you see him furious.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman	999
	will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;	999
	he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has	999
	promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he	999
	will not hurt you. Come on; to't.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Pray God, he keep his oath!	999
	999
VIOLA	I do assure you, 'tis against my will.	999
	999
	[They draw]	999
	999
	[Enter ANTONIO]	999
	999
ANTONIO	Put up your sword. If this young gentleman	999
	Have done offence, I take the fault on me:	999
	If you offend him, I for him defy you.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	You, sir! why, what are you?	999
	999
ANTONIO	One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more	999
	Than you have heard him brag to you he will.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.	999
	999
	[They draw]	999
	999
	[Enter Officers]	999
	999
FABIAN	O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	I'll be with you anon.	999
	999
VIOLA	Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,	999
	I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily	999
	and reins well.	999
	999
First Officer	This is the man; do thy office.	999
	999
Second Officer	Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.	999
	999
ANTONIO	You do mistake me, sir.	999
	999
First Officer	No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,	999
	Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.	999
	Take him away: he knows I know him well.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I must obey.	999
	999
	[To VIOLA]	999
	999
	This comes with seeking you:	999
	But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.	999
	What will you do, now my necessity	999
	Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me	999
	Much more for what I cannot do for you	999
	Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;	999
	But be of comfort.	999
	999
Second Officer	Come, sir, away.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I must entreat of you some of that money.	999
	999
VIOLA	What money, sir?	999
	For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,	999
	And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,	999
	Out of my lean and low ability	999
	I'll lend you something: my having is not much;	999
	I'll make division of my present with you:	999
	Hold, there's half my coffer.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Will you deny me now?	999
	Is't possible that my deserts to you	999
	Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,	999
	Lest that it make me so unsound a man	999
	As to upbraid you with those kindnesses	999
	That I have done for you.	999
	999
VIOLA	I know of none;	999
	Nor know I you by voice or any feature:	999
	I hate ingratitude more in a man	999
	Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,	999
	Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption	999
	Inhabits our frail blood.	999
	999
ANTONIO	O heavens themselves!	999
	999
Second Officer	Come, sir, I pray you, go.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here	999
	I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,	999
	Relieved him with such sanctity of love,	999
	And to his image, which methought did promise	999
	Most venerable worth, did I devotion.	999
	999
First Officer	What's that to us? The time goes by: away!	999
	999
ANTONIO	But O how vile an idol proves this god	999
	Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.	999
	In nature there's no blemish but the mind;	999
	None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:	999
	Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil	999
	Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.	999
	999
First Officer	The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Lead me on.	999
	999
	[Exit with Officers]	999
	999
VIOLA	Methinks his words do from such passion fly,	999
	That he believes himself: so do not I.	999
	Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,	999
	That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll	999
	whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.	999
	999
VIOLA	He named Sebastian: I my brother know	999
	Yet living in my glass; even such and so	999
	In favour was my brother, and he went	999
	Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,	999
	For him I imitate: O, if it prove,	999
	Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than	999
	a hare: his dishonesty appears in leaving his	999
	friend here in necessity and denying him; and for	999
	his cowardship, ask Fabian.	999
	999
FABIAN	A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	An I do not,--	999
	999
FABIAN	Come, let's see the event.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.	999

	TWELFTH NIGHT	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Before OLIVIA's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SEBASTIAN and Clown]	999
	999
Clown	Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:	999
	Let me be clear of thee.	999
	999
Clown	Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor	999
	I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come	999
	speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario;	999
	nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou	999
	know'st not me.	999
	999
Clown	Vent my folly! he has heard that word of some	999
	great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my	999
	folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,	999
	will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy	999
	strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my	999
	lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There's	999
	money for thee: if you tarry longer, I shall give	999
	worse payment.	999
	999
Clown	By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men	999
	that give fools money get themselves a good	999
	report--after fourteen years' purchase.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY BELCH, and FABIAN]	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are all	999
	the people mad?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.	999
	999
Clown	This will I tell my lady straight: I would not be	999
	in some of your coats for two pence.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Come on, sir; hold.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to work	999
	with him; I'll have an action of battery against	999
	him, if there be any law in Illyria: though I	999
	struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Let go thy hand.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young	999
	soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If	999
	thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two	999
	of this malapert blood from you.	999
	999
	[Enter OLIVIA]	999
	999
OLIVIA	Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Madam!	999
	999
OLIVIA	Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,	999
	Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,	999
	Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!	999
	Be not offended, dear Cesario.	999
	Rudesby, be gone!	999
	999
	[Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN]	999
	999
	I prithee, gentle friend,	999
	Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway	999
	In this uncivil and thou unjust extent	999
	Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,	999
	And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks	999
	This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby	999
	Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:	999
	Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,	999
	He started one poor heart of mine in thee.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	What relish is in this? how runs the stream?	999
	Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:	999
	Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;	999
	If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!	999
	999
OLIVIA	Nay, come, I prithee; would thou'ldst be ruled by me!	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Madam, I will.	999
	999
OLIVIA	                  O, say so, and so be!	999

SCENE II	OLIVIA's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter MARIA and Clown]	999
	999
MARIA	Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard;	999
	make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate: do	999
	it quickly; I'll call Sir Toby the whilst.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
Clown	Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself	999
	in't; and I would I were the first that ever	999
	dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to	999
	become the function well, nor lean enough to be	999
	thought a good student; but to be said an honest man	999
	and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a	999
	careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA]	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Jove bless thee, master Parson.	999
	999
Clown	Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of	999
	Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily	999
	said to a niece of King Gorboduc, 'That that is is;'	999
	so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for,	999
	what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	To him, Sir Topas.	999
	999
Clown	What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	[Within]  Who calls there?	999
	999
Clown	Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio	999
	the lunatic.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.	999
	999
Clown	Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man!	999
	talkest thou nothing but of ladies?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Well said, Master Parson.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged: good Sir	999
	Topas, do not think I am mad: they have laid me	999
	here in hideous darkness.	999
	999
Clown	Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most	999
	modest terms; for I am one of those gentle ones	999
	that will use the devil himself with courtesy:	999
	sayest thou that house is dark?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	As hell, Sir Topas.	999
	999
Clown	Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,	999
	and the clearstores toward the south north are as	999
	lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of	999
	obstruction?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark.	999
	999
Clown	Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no darkness	999
	but ignorance; in which thou art more puzzled than	999
	the Egyptians in their fog.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though	999
	ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say, there	999
	was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you	999
	are: make the trial of it in any constant question.	999
	999
Clown	What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.	999
	999
Clown	What thinkest thou of his opinion?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.	999
	999
Clown	Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness:	999
	thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will	999
	allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest	999
	thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Sir Topas, Sir Topas!	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	My most exquisite Sir Topas!	999
	999
Clown	Nay, I am for all waters.	999
	999
MARIA	Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and	999
	gown: he sees thee not.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how	999
	thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this	999
	knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I	999
	would he were, for I am now so far in offence with	999
	my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this	999
	sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.	999
	999
	[Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA]	999
	999
Clown	[Singing]	999
	999
	'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,	999
	Tell me how thy lady does.'	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Fool!	999
	999
Clown	'My lady is unkind, perdy.'	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Fool!	999
	999
Clown	'Alas, why is she so?'	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Fool, I say!	999
	999
Clown	'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my	999
	hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper:	999
	as I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to	999
	thee for't.	999
	999
Clown	Master Malvolio?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Ay, good fool.	999
	999
Clown	Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I	999
	am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.	999
	999
Clown	But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no	999
	better in your wits than a fool.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness,	999
	send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to	999
	face me out of my wits.	999
	999
Clown	Advise you what you say; the minister is here.	999
	Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!	999
	endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain	999
	bibble babble.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Sir Topas!	999
	999
Clown	Maintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I,	999
	sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas.	999
	Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Fool, fool, fool, I say!	999
	999
Clown	Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I am	999
	shent for speaking to you.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: I	999
	tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.	999
	999
Clown	Well-a-day that you were, sir	999
	999
MALVOLIO	By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and	999
	light; and convey what I will set down to my lady:	999
	it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing	999
	of letter did.	999
	999
Clown	I will help you to't. But tell me true, are you	999
	not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.	999
	999
Clown	Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his	999
	brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I	999
	prithee, be gone.	999
	999
Clown	[Singing]	999
	999
	I am gone, sir,	999
	And anon, sir,	999
	I'll be with you again,	999
	In a trice,	999
	Like to the old Vice,	999
	Your need to sustain;	999
	Who, with dagger of lath,	999
	In his rage and his wrath,	999
	Cries, ah, ha! to the devil:	999
	Like a mad lad,	999
	Pare thy nails, dad;	999
	Adieu, good man devil.	999

SCENE III	OLIVIA's garden.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SEBASTIAN]	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	This is the air; that is the glorious sun;	999
	This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;	999
	And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,	999
	Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?	999
	I could not find him at the Elephant:	999
	Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,	999
	That he did range the town to seek me out.	999
	His counsel now might do me golden service;	999
	For though my soul disputes well with my sense,	999
	That this may be some error, but no madness,	999
	Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune	999
	So far exceed all instance, all discourse,	999
	That I am ready to distrust mine eyes	999
	And wrangle with my reason that persuades me	999
	To any other trust but that I am mad	999
	Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,	999
	She could not sway her house, command her followers,	999
	Take and give back affairs and their dispatch	999
	With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing	999
	As I perceive she does: there's something in't	999
	That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.	999
	999
	[Enter OLIVIA and Priest]	999
	999
OLIVIA	Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,	999
	Now go with me and with this holy man	999
	Into the chantry by: there, before him,	999
	And underneath that consecrated roof,	999
	Plight me the full assurance of your faith;	999
	That my most jealous and too doubtful soul	999
	May live at peace. He shall conceal it	999
	Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,	999
	What time we will our celebration keep	999
	According to my birth. What do you say?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	I'll follow this good man, and go with you;	999
	And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine,	999
	That they may fairly note this act of mine!	999

ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Before OLIVIA's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Clown and FABIAN]	999
	999
FABIAN	Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.	999
	999
Clown	Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.	999
	999
FABIAN	Any thing.	999
	999
Clown	Do not desire to see this letter.	999
	999
FABIAN	This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire my	999
	dog again.	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and Lords]	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?	999
	999
Clown	Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?	999
	999
Clown	Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse	999
	for my friends.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.	999
	999
Clown	No, sir, the worse.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	How can that be?	999
	999
Clown	Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me;	999
	now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by	999
	my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,	999
	and by my friends, I am abused: so that,	999
	conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives	999
	make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for	999
	my friends and the better for my foes.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Why, this is excellent.	999
	999
Clown	By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be	999
	one of my friends.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.	999
	999
Clown	But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would	999
	you could make it another.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	O, you give me ill counsel.	999
	999
Clown	Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,	999
	and let your flesh and blood obey it.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a	999
	double-dealer: there's another.	999
	999
Clown	Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old	999
	saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,	999
	sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of	999
	Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:	999
	if you will let your lady know I am here to speak	999
	with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake	999
	my bounty further.	999
	999
Clown	Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come	999
	again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think	999
	that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:	999
	but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I	999
	will awake it anon.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
VIOLA	Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.	999
	999
	[Enter ANTONIO and Officers]	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	That face of his I do remember well;	999
	Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd	999
	As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:	999
	A bawbling vessel was he captain of,	999
	For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;	999
	With which such scathful grapple did he make	999
	With the most noble bottom of our fleet,	999
	That very envy and the tongue of loss	999
	Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?	999
	999
First Officer	Orsino, this is that Antonio	999
	That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;	999
	And this is he that did the Tiger board,	999
	When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:	999
	Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,	999
	In private brabble did we apprehend him.	999
	999
VIOLA	He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;	999
	But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:	999
	I know not what 'twas but distraction.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!	999
	What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,	999
	Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,	999
	Hast made thine enemies?	999
	999
ANTONIO	Orsino, noble sir,	999
	Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:	999
	Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,	999
	Though I confess, on base and ground enough,	999
	Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:	999
	That most ingrateful boy there by your side,	999
	From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth	999
	Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:	999
	His life I gave him and did thereto add	999
	My love, without retention or restraint,	999
	All his in dedication; for his sake	999
	Did I expose myself, pure for his love,	999
	Into the danger of this adverse town;	999
	Drew to defend him when he was beset:	999
	Where being apprehended, his false cunning,	999
	Not meaning to partake with me in danger,	999
	Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,	999
	And grew a twenty years removed thing	999
	While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,	999
	Which I had recommended to his use	999
	Not half an hour before.	999
	999
VIOLA	How can this be?	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	When came he to this town?	999
	999
ANTONIO	To-day, my lord; and for three months before,	999
	No interim, not a minute's vacancy,	999
	Both day and night did we keep company.	999
	999
	[Enter OLIVIA and Attendants]	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.	999
	But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:	999
	Three months this youth hath tended upon me;	999
	But more of that anon. Take him aside.	999
	999
OLIVIA	What would my lord, but that he may not have,	999
	Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?	999
	Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.	999
	999
VIOLA	Madam!	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Gracious Olivia,--	999
	999
OLIVIA	What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--	999
	999
VIOLA	My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.	999
	999
OLIVIA	If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,	999
	It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear	999
	As howling after music.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Still so cruel?	999
	999
OLIVIA	Still so constant, lord.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,	999
	To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars	999
	My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out	999
	That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?	999
	999
OLIVIA	Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,	999
	Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,	999
	Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy	999
	That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:	999
	Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,	999
	And that I partly know the instrument	999
	That screws me from my true place in your favour,	999
	Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;	999
	But this your minion, whom I know you love,	999
	And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,	999
	Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,	999
	Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.	999
	Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:	999
	I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,	999
	To spite a raven's heart within a dove.	999
	999
VIOLA	And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,	999
	To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Where goes Cesario?	999
	999
VIOLA	After him I love	999
	More than I love these eyes, more than my life,	999
	More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.	999
	If I do feign, you witnesses above	999
	Punish my life for tainting of my love!	999
	999
OLIVIA	Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!	999
	999
VIOLA	Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?	999
	999
OLIVIA	Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?	999
	Call forth the holy father.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Come, away!	999
	999
OLIVIA	Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Husband!	999
	999
OLIVIA	       Ay, husband: can he that deny?	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Her husband, sirrah!	999
	999
VIOLA	No, my lord, not I.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear	999
	That makes thee strangle thy propriety:	999
	Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;	999
	Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art	999
	As great as that thou fear'st.	999
	999
	[Enter Priest]	999
	999
		         O, welcome, father!	999
	Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,	999
	Here to unfold, though lately we intended	999
	To keep in darkness what occasion now	999
	Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know	999
	Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.	999
	999
Priest	A contract of eternal bond of love,	999
	Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,	999
	Attested by the holy close of lips,	999
	Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;	999
	And all the ceremony of this compact	999
	Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:	999
	Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave	999
	I have travell'd but two hours.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be	999
	When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?	999
	Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,	999
	That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?	999
	Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet	999
	Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.	999
	999
VIOLA	My lord, I do protest--	999
	999
OLIVIA	O, do not swear!	999
	Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR ANDREW]	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently	999
	to Sir Toby.	999
	999
OLIVIA	What's the matter?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby	999
	a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your	999
	help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Who has done this, Sir Andrew?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for	999
	a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	My gentleman, Cesario?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for	999
	nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do't	999
	by Sir Toby.	999
	999
VIOLA	Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:	999
	You drew your sword upon me without cause;	999
	But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I	999
	think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown]	999
	999
	Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:	999
	but if he had not been in drink, he would have	999
	tickled you othergates than he did.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	How now, gentleman! how is't with you?	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end	999
	on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?	999
	999
Clown	O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes	999
	were set at eight i' the morning.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I	999
	hate a drunken rogue.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?	999
	999
SIR ANDREW	I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together.	999
	999
SIR TOBY BELCH	Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a	999
	knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!	999
	999
OLIVIA	Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW]	999
	999
	[Enter SEBASTIAN]	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:	999
	But, had it been the brother of my blood,	999
	I must have done no less with wit and safety.	999
	You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that	999
	I do perceive it hath offended you:	999
	Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows	999
	We made each other but so late ago.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,	999
	A natural perspective, that is and is not!	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Antonio, O my dear Antonio!	999
	How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,	999
	Since I have lost thee!	999
	999
ANTONIO	Sebastian are you?	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	                  Fear'st thou that, Antonio?	999
	999
ANTONIO	How have you made division of yourself?	999
	An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin	999
	Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?	999
	999
OLIVIA	Most wonderful!	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	Do I stand there? I never had a brother;	999
	Nor can there be that deity in my nature,	999
	Of here and every where. I had a sister,	999
	Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.	999
	Of charity, what kin are you to me?	999
	What countryman? what name? what parentage?	999
	999
VIOLA	Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;	999
	Such a Sebastian was my brother too,	999
	So went he suited to his watery tomb:	999
	If spirits can assume both form and suit	999
	You come to fright us.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	A spirit I am indeed;	999
	But am in that dimension grossly clad	999
	Which from the womb I did participate.	999
	Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,	999
	I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,	999
	And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'	999
	999
VIOLA	My father had a mole upon his brow.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	And so had mine.	999
	999
VIOLA	And died that day when Viola from her birth	999
	Had number'd thirteen years.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	O, that record is lively in my soul!	999
	He finished indeed his mortal act	999
	That day that made my sister thirteen years.	999
	999
VIOLA	If nothing lets to make us happy both	999
	But this my masculine usurp'd attire,	999
	Do not embrace me till each circumstance	999
	Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump	999
	That I am Viola: which to confirm,	999
	I'll bring you to a captain in this town,	999
	Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help	999
	I was preserved to serve this noble count.	999
	All the occurrence of my fortune since	999
	Hath been between this lady and this lord.	999
	999
SEBASTIAN	[To OLIVIA]  So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:	999
	But nature to her bias drew in that.	999
	You would have been contracted to a maid;	999
	Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,	999
	You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.	999
	If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,	999
	I shall have share in this most happy wreck.	999
	999
	[To VIOLA]	999
	999
	Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times	999
	Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.	999
	999
VIOLA	And all those sayings will I overswear;	999
	And those swearings keep as true in soul	999
	As doth that orbed continent the fire	999
	That severs day from night.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Give me thy hand;	999
	And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.	999
	999
VIOLA	The captain that did bring me first on shore	999
	Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action	999
	Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,	999
	A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.	999
	999
OLIVIA	He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:	999
	And yet, alas, now I remember me,	999
	They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN]	999
	999
	A most extracting frenzy of mine own	999
	From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.	999
	How does he, sirrah?	999
	999
Clown	Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as	999
	well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a	999
	letter to you; I should have given't you to-day	999
	morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,	999
	so it skills not much when they are delivered.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Open't, and read it.	999
	999
Clown	Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers	999
	the madman.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'By the Lord, madam,'--	999
	999
OLIVIA	How now! art thou mad?	999
	999
Clown	No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship	999
	will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Prithee, read i' thy right wits.	999
	999
Clown	So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to	999
	read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Read it you, sirrah.	999
	999
	[To FABIAN]	999
	999
FABIAN	[Reads]  'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the	999
	world shall know it: though you have put me into	999
	darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over	999
	me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as	999
	your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced	999
	me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt	999
	not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.	999
	Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little	999
	unthought of and speak out of my injury.	999
		         THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'	999
	999
OLIVIA	Did he write this?	999
	999
Clown	Ay, madam.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	This savours not much of distraction.	999
	999
OLIVIA	See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.	999
	999
	[Exit FABIAN]	999
	999
	My lord so please you, these things further	999
	thought on,	999
	To think me as well a sister as a wife,	999
	One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,	999
	Here at my house and at my proper cost.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.	999
	999
	[To VIOLA]	999
	999
	Your master quits you; and for your service done him,	999
	So much against the mettle of your sex,	999
	So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,	999
	And since you call'd me master for so long,	999
	Here is my hand: you shall from this time be	999
	Your master's mistress.	999
	999
OLIVIA	A sister! you are she.	999
	999
	[Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO]	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Is this the madman?	999
	999
OLIVIA	Ay, my lord, this same.	999
	How now, Malvolio!	999
	999
MALVOLIO	                  Madam, you have done me wrong,	999
	Notorious wrong.	999
	999
OLIVIA	                  Have I, Malvolio? no.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.	999
	You must not now deny it is your hand:	999
	Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;	999
	Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:	999
	You can say none of this: well, grant it then	999
	And tell me, in the modesty of honour,	999
	Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,	999
	Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,	999
	To put on yellow stockings and to frown	999
	Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;	999
	And, acting this in an obedient hope,	999
	Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,	999
	Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,	999
	And made the most notorious geck and gull	999
	That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,	999
	Though, I confess, much like the character	999
	But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.	999
	And now I do bethink me, it was she	999
	First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,	999
	And in such forms which here were presupposed	999
	Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:	999
	This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;	999
	But when we know the grounds and authors of it,	999
	Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge	999
	Of thine own cause.	999
	999
FABIAN	Good madam, hear me speak,	999
	And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come	999
	Taint the condition of this present hour,	999
	Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,	999
	Most freely I confess, myself and Toby	999
	Set this device against Malvolio here,	999
	Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts	999
	We had conceived against him: Maria writ	999
	The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;	999
	In recompense whereof he hath married her.	999
	How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,	999
	May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;	999
	If that the injuries be justly weigh'd	999
	That have on both sides pass'd.	999
	999
OLIVIA	Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!	999
	999
Clown	Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,	999
	and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was	999
	one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but	999
	that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'	999
	But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such	999
	a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'	999
	and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.	999
	999
MALVOLIO	I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
OLIVIA	He hath been most notoriously abused.	999
	999
DUKE ORSINO	Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:	999
	He hath not told us of the captain yet:	999
	When that is known and golden time convents,	999
	A solemn combination shall be made	999
	Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,	999
	We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;	999
	For so you shall be, while you are a man;	999
	But when in other habits you are seen,	999
	Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all, except Clown]	999
	999
Clown	[Sings]	999
	999
	When that I was and a little tiny boy,	999
	With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,	999
	A foolish thing was but a toy,	999
	For the rain it raineth every day.	999
	999
	But when I came to man's estate,	999
	With hey, ho, &c.	999
	'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,	999
	For the rain, &c.	999
	999
	But when I came, alas! to wive,	999
	With hey, ho, &c.	999
	By swaggering could I never thrive,	999
	For the rain, &c.	999
	999
	But when I came unto my beds,	999
	With hey, ho, &c.	999
	With toss-pots still had drunken heads,	999
	For the rain, &c.	999
	999
	A great while ago the world begun,	999
	With hey, ho, &c.	999
	But that's all one, our play is done,	999
	And we'll strive to please you every day.	999

SCENE	Verona; Milan; the frontiers of Mantua.	999
	999
	999
	999
	999
	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Verona. An open place.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS]	999
	999
VALENTINE	Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:	999
	Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.	999
	Were't not affection chains thy tender days	999
	To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,	999
	I rather would entreat thy company	999
	To see the wonders of the world abroad,	999
	Than, living dully sluggardized at home,	999
	Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.	999
	But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,	999
	Even as I would when I to love begin.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!	999
	Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest	999
	Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:	999
	Wish me partaker in thy happiness	999
	When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,	999
	If ever danger do environ thee,	999
	Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,	999
	For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.	999
	999
VALENTINE	And on a love-book pray for my success?	999
	999
PROTEUS	Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.	999
	999
VALENTINE	That's on some shallow story of deep love:	999
	How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.	999
	999
PROTEUS	That's a deep story of a deeper love:	999
	For he was more than over shoes in love.	999
	999
VALENTINE	'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,	999
	And yet you never swum the Hellespont.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.	999
	999
VALENTINE	No, I will not, for it boots thee not.	999
	999
PROTEUS	What?	999
	999
VALENTINE	To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;	999
	Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth	999
	With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:	999
	If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;	999
	If lost, why then a grievous labour won;	999
	However, but a folly bought with wit,	999
	Or else a wit by folly vanquished.	999
	999
PROTEUS	So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.	999
	999
VALENTINE	So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.	999
	999
PROTEUS	'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Love is your master, for he masters you:	999
	And he that is so yoked by a fool,	999
	Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud	999
	The eating canker dwells, so eating love	999
	Inhabits in the finest wits of all.	999
	999
VALENTINE	And writers say, as the most forward bud	999
	Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,	999
	Even so by love the young and tender wit	999
	Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,	999
	Losing his verdure even in the prime	999
	And all the fair effects of future hopes.	999
	But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,	999
	That art a votary to fond desire?	999
	Once more adieu! my father at the road	999
	Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.	999
	999
PROTEUS	And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.	999
	To Milan let me hear from thee by letters	999
	Of thy success in love, and what news else	999
	Betideth here in absence of thy friend;	999
	And likewise will visit thee with mine.	999
	999
PROTEUS	All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!	999
	999
VALENTINE	As much to you at home! and so, farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PROTEUS	He after honour hunts, I after love:	999
	He leaves his friends to dignify them more,	999
	I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.	999
	Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,	999
	Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,	999
	War with good counsel, set the world at nought;	999
	Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.	999
	999
	[Enter SPEED]	999
	999
SPEED	Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?	999
	999
PROTEUS	But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.	999
	999
SPEED	Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,	999
	And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,	999
	An if the shepherd be a while away.	999
	999
SPEED	You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,	999
	and I a sheep?	999
	999
PROTEUS	I do.	999
	999
SPEED	Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.	999
	999
PROTEUS	A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.	999
	999
SPEED	This proves me still a sheep.	999
	999
PROTEUS	True; and thy master a shepherd.	999
	999
SPEED	Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.	999
	999
PROTEUS	It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.	999
	999
SPEED	The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the	999
	shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks	999
	not me: therefore I am no sheep.	999
	999
PROTEUS	The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the	999
	shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for	999
	wages followest thy master; thy master for wages	999
	follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.	999
	999
SPEED	Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'	999
	999
PROTEUS	But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?	999
	999
SPEED	Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,	999
	a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a	999
	lost mutton, nothing for my labour.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.	999
	999
SPEED	If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.	999
	999
SPEED	Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for	999
	carrying your letter.	999
	999
PROTEUS	You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.	999
	999
SPEED	From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,	999
	'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to	999
	your lover.	999
	999
PROTEUS	But what said she?	999
	999
SPEED	[First nodding]  Ay.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.	999
	999
SPEED	You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask	999
	me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'	999
	999
PROTEUS	And that set together is noddy.	999
	999
SPEED	Now you have taken the pains to set it together,	999
	take it for your pains.	999
	999
PROTEUS	No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.	999
	999
SPEED	Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Why sir, how do you bear with me?	999
	999
SPEED	Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing	999
	but the word 'noddy' for my pains.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.	999
	999
SPEED	And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?	999
	999
SPEED	Open your purse, that the money and the matter may	999
	be both at once delivered.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?	999
	999
SPEED	Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?	999
	999
SPEED	Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,	999
	not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:	999
	and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I	999
	fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your	999
	mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as	999
	hard as steel.	999
	999
PROTEUS	What said she? nothing?	999
	999
SPEED	No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To	999
	testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned	999
	me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your	999
	letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,	999
	Which cannot perish having thee aboard,	999
	Being destined to a drier death on shore.	999
	999
	[Exit SPEED]	999
	999
	I must go send some better messenger:	999
	I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,	999
	Receiving them from such a worthless post.	999
	999

	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA	999
	999
	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	The same. Garden of JULIA's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter JULlA and LUCETTA]	999
	999
JULIA	But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,	999
	Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?	999
	999
LUCETTA	Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.	999
	999
JULIA	Of all the fair resort of gentlemen	999
	That every day with parle encounter me,	999
	In thy opinion which is worthiest love?	999
	999
LUCETTA	Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind	999
	According to my shallow simple skill.	999
	999
JULIA	What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?	999
	999
LUCETTA	As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;	999
	But, were I you, he never should be mine.	999
	999
JULIA	What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?	999
	999
LUCETTA	Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.	999
	999
JULIA	What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?	999
	999
LUCETTA	Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!	999
	999
JULIA	How now! what means this passion at his name?	999
	999
LUCETTA	Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame	999
	That I, unworthy body as I am,	999
	Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.	999
	999
JULIA	Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?	999
	999
LUCETTA	Then thus: of many good I think him best.	999
	999
JULIA	Your reason?	999
	999
LUCETTA	I have no other, but a woman's reason;	999
	I think him so because I think him so.	999
	999
JULIA	And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?	999
	999
LUCETTA	Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.	999
	999
JULIA	Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.	999
	999
LUCETTA	Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.	999
	999
JULIA	His little speaking shows his love but small.	999
	999
LUCETTA	Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.	999
	999
JULIA	They do not love that do not show their love.	999
	999
LUCETTA	O, they love least that let men know their love.	999
	999
JULIA	I would I knew his mind.	999
	999
LUCETTA	Peruse this paper, madam.	999
	999
JULIA	'To Julia.' Say, from whom?	999
	999
LUCETTA	That the contents will show.	999
	999
JULIA	Say, say, who gave it thee?	999
	999
LUCETTA	Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.	999
	He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,	999
	Did in your name receive it: pardon the	999
	fault I pray.	999
	999
JULIA	Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!	999
	Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?	999
	To whisper and conspire against my youth?	999
	Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth	999
	And you an officer fit for the place.	999
	Or else return no more into my sight.	999
	999
LUCETTA	To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.	999
	999
JULIA	Will ye be gone?	999
	999
LUCETTA	                  That you may ruminate.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
JULIA	And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:	999
	It were a shame to call her back again	999
	And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.	999
	What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,	999
	And would not force the letter to my view!	999
	Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that	999
	Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'	999
	Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love	999
	That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse	999
	And presently all humbled kiss the rod!	999
	How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,	999
	When willingly I would have had her here!	999
	How angerly I taught my brow to frown,	999
	When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!	999
	My penance is to call Lucetta back	999
	And ask remission for my folly past.	999
	What ho! Lucetta!	999
	999
	[Re-enter LUCETTA]	999
	999
LUCETTA	                  What would your ladyship?	999
	999
JULIA	Is't near dinner-time?	999
	999
LUCETTA	I would it were,	999
	That you might kill your stomach on your meat	999
	And not upon your maid.	999
	999
JULIA	What is't that you took up so gingerly?	999
	999
LUCETTA	Nothing.	999
	999
JULIA	Why didst thou stoop, then?	999
	999
LUCETTA	To take a paper up that I let fall.	999
	999
JULIA	And is that paper nothing?	999
	999
LUCETTA	Nothing concerning me.	999
	999
JULIA	Then let it lie for those that it concerns.	999
	999
LUCETTA	Madam, it will not lie where it concerns	999
	Unless it have a false interpeter.	999
	999
JULIA	Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.	999
	999
LUCETTA	That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.	999
	Give me a note: your ladyship can set.	999
	999
JULIA	As little by such toys as may be possible.	999
	Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'	999
	999
LUCETTA	It is too heavy for so light a tune.	999
	999
JULIA	Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?	999
	999
LUCETTA	Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.	999
	999
JULIA	And why not you?	999
	999
LUCETTA	                  I cannot reach so high.	999
	999
JULIA	Let's see your song. How now, minion!	999
	999
LUCETTA	Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:	999
	And yet methinks I do not like this tune.	999
	999
JULIA	You do not?	999
	999
LUCETTA	          No, madam; it is too sharp.	999
	999
JULIA	You, minion, are too saucy.	999
	999
LUCETTA	Nay, now you are too flat	999
	And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:	999
	There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.	999
	999
JULIA	The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.	999
	999
LUCETTA	Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.	999
	999
JULIA	This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.	999
	Here is a coil with protestation!	999
	999
	[Tears the letter]	999
	999
	Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:	999
	You would be fingering them, to anger me.	999
	999
LUCETTA	She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased	999
	To be so anger'd with another letter.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
JULIA	 Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!	999
	O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!	999
	Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey	999
	And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!	999
	I'll kiss each several paper for amends.	999
	Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!	999
	As in revenge of thy ingratitude,	999
	I throw thy name against the bruising stones,	999
	Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.	999
	And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'	999
	Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed	999
	Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;	999
	And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.	999
	But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.	999
	Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away	999
	Till I have found each letter in the letter,	999
	Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear	999
	Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock	999
	And throw it thence into the raging sea!	999
	Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,	999
	'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,	999
	To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.	999
	And yet I will not, sith so prettily	999
	He couples it to his complaining names.	999
	Thus will I fold them one on another:	999
	Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.	999
	999
	[Re-enter LUCETTA]	999
	999
LUCETTA	Madam,	999
	Dinner is ready, and your father stays.	999
	999
JULIA	Well, let us go.	999
	999
LUCETTA	What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?	999
	999
JULIA	If you respect them, best to take them up.	999
	999
LUCETTA	Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:	999
	Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.	999
	999
JULIA	I see you have a month's mind to them.	999
	999
LUCETTA	Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;	999
	I see things too, although you judge I wink.	999
	999
JULIA	Come, come; will't please you go?	999

	999
SCENE III	The same. ANTONIO's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO]	999
	999
ANTONIO	Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that	999
	Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?	999
	999
PANTHINO	'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Why, what of him?	999
	999
PANTHINO	                  He wonder'd that your lordship	999
	Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,	999
	While other men, of slender reputation,	999
	Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:	999
	Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;	999
	Some to discover islands far away;	999
	Some to the studious universities.	999
	For any or for all these exercises,	999
	He said that Proteus your son was meet,	999
	And did request me to importune you	999
	To let him spend his time no more at home,	999
	Which would be great impeachment to his age,	999
	In having known no travel in his youth.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Nor need'st thou much importune me to that	999
	Whereon this month I have been hammering.	999
	I have consider'd well his loss of time	999
	And how he cannot be a perfect man,	999
	Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:	999
	Experience is by industry achieved	999
	And perfected by the swift course of time.	999
	Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?	999
	999
PANTHINO	I think your lordship is not ignorant	999
	How his companion, youthful Valentine,	999
	Attends the emperor in his royal court.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I know it well.	999
	999
PANTHINO	'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:	999
	There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,	999
	Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.	999
	And be in eye of every exercise	999
	Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.	999
	999
ANTONIO	I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:	999
	And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,	999
	The execution of it shall make known.	999
	Even with the speediest expedition	999
	I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.	999
	999
PANTHINO	To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,	999
	With other gentlemen of good esteem,	999
	Are journeying to salute the emperor	999
	And to commend their service to his will.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Good company; with them shall Proteus go:	999
	And, in good time! now will we break with him.	999
	999
	[Enter PROTEUS]	999
	999
PROTEUS	Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!	999
	Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;	999
	Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.	999
	O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,	999
	To seal our happiness with their consents!	999
	O heavenly Julia!	999
	999
ANTONIO	How now! what letter are you reading there?	999
	999
PROTEUS	May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two	999
	Of commendations sent from Valentine,	999
	Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Lend me the letter; let me see what news.	999
	999
PROTEUS	There is no news, my lord, but that he writes	999
	How happily he lives, how well beloved	999
	And daily graced by the emperor;	999
	Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.	999
	999
ANTONIO	And how stand you affected to his wish?	999
	999
PROTEUS	As one relying on your lordship's will	999
	And not depending on his friendly wish.	999
	999
ANTONIO	My will is something sorted with his wish.	999
	Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;	999
	For what I will, I will, and there an end.	999
	I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time	999
	With Valentinus in the emperor's court:	999
	What maintenance he from his friends receives,	999
	Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.	999
	To-morrow be in readiness to go:	999
	Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.	999
	999
PROTEUS	My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:	999
	Please you, deliberate a day or two.	999
	999
ANTONIO	Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:	999
	No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.	999
	Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd	999
	To hasten on his expedition.	999
	999
	[Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO]	999
	999
PROTEUS	Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,	999
	And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.	999
	I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,	999
	Lest he should take exceptions to my love;	999
	And with the vantage of mine own excuse	999
	Hath he excepted most against my love.	999
	O, how this spring of love resembleth	999
	The uncertain glory of an April day,	999
	Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,	999
	And by and by a cloud takes all away!	999
	999
	[Re-enter PANTHINO]	999
	999
PANTHINO	Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:	999
	He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,	999
	And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Milan. The DUKE's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter VALENTINE and SPEED]	999
	999
SPEED	Sir, your glove.	999
	999
VALENTINE	                  Not mine; my gloves are on.	999
	999
SPEED	Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:	999
	Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!	999
	Ah, Silvia, Silvia!	999
	999
SPEED	Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!	999
	999
VALENTINE	How now, sirrah?	999
	999
SPEED	She is not within hearing, sir.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Why, sir, who bade you call her?	999
	999
SPEED	Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Well, you'll still be too forward.	999
	999
SPEED	And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?	999
	999
SPEED	She that your worship loves?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Why, how know you that I am in love?	999
	999
SPEED	Marry, by these special marks: first, you have	999
	learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,	999
	like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a	999
	robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had	999
	the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had	999
	lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had	999
	buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes	999
	diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to	999
	speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were	999
	wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you	999
	walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you	999
	fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you	999
	looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you	999
	are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look	999
	on you, I can hardly think you my master.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Are all these things perceived in me?	999
	999
SPEED	They are all perceived without ye.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Without me? they cannot.	999
	999
SPEED	Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you	999
	were so simple, none else would: but you are so	999
	without these follies, that these follies are within	999
	you and shine through you like the water in an	999
	urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a	999
	physician to comment on your malady.	999
	999
VALENTINE	But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?	999
	999
SPEED	She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.	999
	999
SPEED	Why, sir, I know her not.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet	999
	knowest her not?	999
	999
SPEED	Is she not hard-favoured, sir?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.	999
	999
SPEED	Sir, I know that well enough.	999
	999
VALENTINE	What dost thou know?	999
	999
SPEED	That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.	999
	999
VALENTINE	I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.	999
	999
SPEED	That's because the one is painted and the other out	999
	of all count.	999
	999
VALENTINE	How painted? and how out of count?	999
	999
SPEED	Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no	999
	man counts of her beauty.	999
	999
VALENTINE	How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.	999
	999
SPEED	You never saw her since she was deformed.	999
	999
VALENTINE	How long hath she been deformed?	999
	999
SPEED	Ever since you loved her.	999
	999
VALENTINE	I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I	999
	see her beautiful.	999
	999
SPEED	If you love her, you cannot see her.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Why?	999
	999
SPEED	Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;	999
	or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to	999
	have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going	999
	ungartered!	999
	999
VALENTINE	What should I see then?	999
	999
SPEED	Your own present folly and her passing deformity:	999
	for he, being in love, could not see to garter his	999
	hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last	999
	morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.	999
	999
SPEED	True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,	999
	you swinged me for my love, which makes me the	999
	bolder to chide you for yours.	999
	999
VALENTINE	In conclusion, I stand affected to her.	999
	999
SPEED	I would you were set, so your affection would cease.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to	999
	one she loves.	999
	999
SPEED	And have you?	999
	999
VALENTINE	I have.	999
	999
SPEED	Are they not lamely writ?	999
	999
VALENTINE	No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!	999
	here she comes.	999
	999
SPEED	[Aside]  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!	999
	Now will he interpret to her.	999
	999
	[Enter SILVIA]	999
	999
VALENTINE	Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.	999
	999
SPEED	[Aside]  O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.	999
	999
SILVIA	Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.	999
	999
SPEED	[Aside]  He should give her interest and she gives it him.	999
	999
VALENTINE	As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter	999
	Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;	999
	Which I was much unwilling to proceed in	999
	But for my duty to your ladyship.	999
	999
SILVIA	I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;	999
	For being ignorant to whom it goes	999
	I writ at random, very doubtfully.	999
	999
SILVIA	Perchance you think too much of so much pains?	999
	999
VALENTINE	No, madam; so it stead you, I will write	999
	Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--	999
	999
SILVIA	A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;	999
	And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;	999
	And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,	999
	Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.	999
	999
SPEED	[Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'	999
	999
VALENTINE	What means your ladyship? do you not like it?	999
	999
SILVIA	Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;	999
	But since unwillingly, take them again.	999
	Nay, take them.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Madam, they are for you.	999
	999
SILVIA	Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;	999
	But I will none of them; they are for you;	999
	I would have had them writ more movingly.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.	999
	999
SILVIA	And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,	999
	And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.	999
	999
VALENTINE	If it please me, madam, what then?	999
	999
SILVIA	Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:	999
	And so, good morrow, servant.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SPEED	O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,	999
	As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!	999
	My master sues to her, and she hath	999
	taught her suitor,	999
	He being her pupil, to become her tutor.	999
	O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,	999
	That my master, being scribe, to himself should write	999
	the letter?	999
	999
VALENTINE	How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?	999
	999
SPEED	Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.	999
	999
VALENTINE	To do what?	999
	999
SPEED	To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.	999
	999
VALENTINE	To whom?	999
	999
SPEED	To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.	999
	999
VALENTINE	What figure?	999
	999
SPEED	By a letter, I should say.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Why, she hath not writ to me?	999
	999
SPEED	What need she, when she hath made you write to	999
	yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?	999
	999
VALENTINE	No, believe me.	999
	999
SPEED	No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive	999
	her earnest?	999
	999
VALENTINE	She gave me none, except an angry word.	999
	999
SPEED	Why, she hath given you a letter.	999
	999
VALENTINE	That's the letter I writ to her friend.	999
	999
SPEED	And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.	999
	999
VALENTINE	I would it were no worse.	999
	999
SPEED	I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:	999
	For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,	999
	Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;	999
	Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,	999
	Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.	999
	All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.	999
	Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.	999
	999
VALENTINE	I have dined.	999
	999
SPEED	Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can	999
	feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my	999
	victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like	999
	your mistress; be moved, be moved.	999

SCENE II	Verona. JULIA'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PROTEUS and JULIA]	999
	999
PROTEUS	Have patience, gentle Julia.	999
	999
JULIA	I must, where is no remedy.	999
	999
PROTEUS	When possibly I can, I will return.	999
	999
JULIA	If you turn not, you will return the sooner.	999
	Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.	999
	999
	[Giving a ring]	999
	999
PROTEUS	Why then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.	999
	999
JULIA	And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Here is my hand for my true constancy;	999
	And when that hour o'erslips me in the day	999
	Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,	999
	The next ensuing hour some foul mischance	999
	Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!	999
	My father stays my coming; answer not;	999
	The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;	999
	That tide will stay me longer than I should.	999
	Julia, farewell!	999
	999
	[Exit JULIA]	999
	999
	What, gone without a word?	999
	Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;	999
	For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.	999
	999
	[Enter PANTHINO]	999
	999
PANTHINO	Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.	999

	Alas! this parting strikes poor lovers dumb.	999

SCENE III	The same. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LAUNCE, leading a dog]	999
	999
LAUNCE	Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping;	999
	all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I	999
	have received my proportion, like the prodigious	999
	son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's	999
	court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured	999
	dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father	999
	wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat	999
	wringing her hands, and all our house in a great	999
	perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed	999
	one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and	999
	has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have	999
	wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,	999
	having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my	999
	parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This	999
	shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:	999
	no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that	999
	cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it	999
	hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in	999
	it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance	999
	on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my	999
	sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and	999
	as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I	999
	am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the	999
	dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,	999
	so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:	999
	now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:	999
	now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now	999
	come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now	999
	like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there	999
	'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now	999
	come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now	999
	the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a	999
	word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.	999
	999
	[Enter PANTHINO]	999
	999
PANTHINO	Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped	999
	and thou art to post after with oars. What's the	999
	matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You'll	999
	lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.	999
	999
LAUNCE	It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the	999
	unkindest tied that ever any man tied.	999
	999
PANTHINO	What's the unkindest tide?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.	999
	999
PANTHINO	Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in	999
	losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing	999
	thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy	999
	master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy	999
	service,--Why dost thou stop my mouth?	999
	999
LAUNCE	For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.	999
	999
PANTHINO	Where should I lose my tongue?	999
	999
LAUNCE	In thy tale.	999
	999
PANTHINO	In thy tail!	999
	999
LAUNCE	Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and	999
	the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river	999
	were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the	999
	wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.	999
	999
PANTHINO	Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.	999
	999
LAUNCE	Sir, call me what thou darest.	999
	999
PANTHINO	Wilt thou go?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Well, I will go.	999

	999
	[Enter SILVIA, VALENTINE, THURIO, and SPEED]	999
	999
SILVIA	Servant!	999
	999
VALENTINE	Mistress?	999
	999
SPEED	Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Ay, boy, it's for love.	999
	999
SPEED	Not of you.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Of my mistress, then.	999
	999
SPEED	'Twere good you knocked him.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SILVIA	Servant, you are sad.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Indeed, madam, I seem so.	999
	999
THURIO	Seem you that you are not?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Haply I do.	999
	999
THURIO	So do counterfeits.	999
	999
VALENTINE	So do you.	999
	999
THURIO	What seem I that I am not?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Wise.	999
	999
THURIO	What instance of the contrary?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Your folly.	999
	999
THURIO	And how quote you my folly?	999
	999
VALENTINE	I quote it in your jerkin.	999
	999
THURIO	My jerkin is a doublet.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Well, then, I'll double your folly.	999
	999
THURIO	How?	999
	999
SILVIA	What, angry, Sir Thurio! do you change colour?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.	999
	999
THURIO	That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live	999
	in your air.	999
	999
VALENTINE	You have said, sir.	999
	999
THURIO	Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.	999
	999
VALENTINE	I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.	999
	999
SILVIA	A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.	999
	999
VALENTINE	'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.	999
	999
SILVIA	Who is that, servant?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir	999
	Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,	999
	and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.	999
	999
THURIO	Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall	999
	make your wit bankrupt.	999
	999
VALENTINE	I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,	999
	and, I think, no other treasure to give your	999
	followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,	999
	that they live by your bare words.	999
	999
SILVIA	No more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father.	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE]	999
	999
DUKE	Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.	999
	Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:	999
	What say you to a letter from your friends	999
	Of much good news?	999
	999
VALENTINE	                  My lord, I will be thankful.	999
	To any happy messenger from thence.	999
	999
DUKE	Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman	999
	To be of worth and worthy estimation	999
	And not without desert so well reputed.	999
	999
DUKE	Hath he not a son?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves	999
	The honour and regard of such a father.	999
	999
DUKE	You know him well?	999
	999
VALENTINE	I know him as myself; for from our infancy	999
	We have conversed and spent our hours together:	999
	And though myself have been an idle truant,	999
	Omitting the sweet benefit of time	999
	To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,	999
	Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,	999
	Made use and fair advantage of his days;	999
	His years but young, but his experience old;	999
	His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;	999
	And, in a word, for far behind his worth	999
	Comes all the praises that I now bestow,	999
	He is complete in feature and in mind	999
	With all good grace to grace a gentleman.	999
	999
DUKE	Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,	999
	He is as worthy for an empress' love	999
	As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.	999
	Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,	999
	With commendation from great potentates;	999
	And here he means to spend his time awhile:	999
	I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.	999
	999
DUKE	Welcome him then according to his worth.	999
	Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;	999
	For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:	999
	I will send him hither to you presently.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
VALENTINE	This is the gentleman I told your ladyship	999
	Had come along with me, but that his mistress	999
	Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.	999
	999
SILVIA	Belike that now she hath enfranchised them	999
	Upon some other pawn for fealty.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.	999
	999
SILVIA	Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind	999
	How could he see his way to seek out you?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.	999
	999
THURIO	They say that Love hath not an eye at all.	999
	999
VALENTINE	To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:	999
	Upon a homely object Love can wink.	999
	999
SILVIA	Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.	999
	999
	[Exit THURIO]	999
	999
	[Enter PROTEUS]	999
	999
VALENTINE	Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,	999
	Confirm his welcome with some special favour.	999
	999
SILVIA	His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,	999
	If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him	999
	To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.	999
	999
SILVIA	Too low a mistress for so high a servant.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Not so, sweet lady: but too mean a servant	999
	To have a look of such a worthy mistress.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Leave off discourse of disability:	999
	Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.	999
	999
PROTEUS	My duty will I boast of; nothing else.	999
	999
SILVIA	And duty never yet did want his meed:	999
	Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.	999
	999
PROTEUS	I'll die on him that says so but yourself.	999
	999
SILVIA	That you are welcome?	999
	999
PROTEUS	That you are worthless.	999
	999
	[Re-enter THURIO]	999
	999
THURIO	Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.	999
	999
SILVIA	I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,	999
	Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:	999
	I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;	999
	When you have done, we look to hear from you.	999
	999
PROTEUS	We'll both attend upon your ladyship.	999
	999
	[Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO]	999
	999
VALENTINE	Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?	999
	999
PROTEUS	Your friends are well and have them much commended.	999
	999
VALENTINE	And how do yours?	999
	999
PROTEUS	                  I left them all in health.	999
	999
VALENTINE	How does your lady? and how thrives your love?	999
	999
PROTEUS	My tales of love were wont to weary you;	999
	I know you joy not in a love discourse.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:	999
	I have done penance for contemning Love,	999
	Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me	999
	With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,	999
	With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;	999
	For in revenge of my contempt of love,	999
	Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes	999
	And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.	999
	O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,	999
	And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,	999
	There is no woe to his correction,	999
	Nor to his service no such joy on earth.	999
	Now no discourse, except it be of love;	999
	Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,	999
	Upon the very naked name of love.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.	999
	Was this the idol that you worship so?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?	999
	999
PROTEUS	No; but she is an earthly paragon.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Call her divine.	999
	999
PROTEUS	                  I will not flatter her.	999
	999
VALENTINE	O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.	999
	999
PROTEUS	When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,	999
	And I must minister the like to you.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,	999
	Yet let her be a principality,	999
	Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Except my mistress.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Sweet, except not any;	999
	Except thou wilt except against my love.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Have I not reason to prefer mine own?	999
	999
VALENTINE	And I will help thee to prefer her too:	999
	She shall be dignified with this high honour--	999
	To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth	999
	Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss	999
	And, of so great a favour growing proud,	999
	Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower	999
	And make rough winter everlastingly.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing	999
	To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;	999
	She is alone.	999
	999
PROTEUS	                  Then let her alone.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,	999
	And I as rich in having such a jewel	999
	As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,	999
	The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.	999
	Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,	999
	Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.	999
	My foolish rival, that her father likes	999
	Only for his possessions are so huge,	999
	Is gone with her along, and I must after,	999
	For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.	999
	999
PROTEUS	But she loves you?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,	999
	marriage-hour,	999
	With all the cunning manner of our flight,	999
	Determined of; how I must climb her window,	999
	The ladder made of cords, and all the means	999
	Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.	999
	Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,	999
	In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:	999
	I must unto the road, to disembark	999
	Some necessaries that I needs must use,	999
	And then I'll presently attend you.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Will you make haste?	999
	999
PROTEUS	I will.	999
	999
	[Exit VALENTINE]	999
	999
	Even as one heat another heat expels,	999
	Or as one nail by strength drives out another,	999
	So the remembrance of my former love	999
	Is by a newer object quite forgotten.	999
	Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,	999
	Her true perfection, or my false transgression,	999
	That makes me reasonless to reason thus?	999
	She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--	999
	That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;	999
	Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,	999
	Bears no impression of the thing it was.	999
	Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,	999
	And that I love him not as I was wont.	999
	O, but I love his lady too too much,	999
	And that's the reason I love him so little.	999
	How shall I dote on her with more advice,	999
	That thus without advice begin to love her!	999
	'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,	999
	And that hath dazzled my reason's light;	999
	But when I look on her perfections,	999
	There is no reason but I shall be blind.	999
	If I can cheque my erring love, I will;	999
	If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.	999

	[Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally]	999
	999
SPEED	Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!	999
	999
LAUNCE	Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not	999
	welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never	999
	undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a	999
	place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess	999
	say 'Welcome!'	999
	999
SPEED	Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you	999
	presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou	999
	shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how	999
	did thy master part with Madam Julia?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very	999
	fairly in jest.	999
	999
SPEED	But shall she marry him?	999
	999
LAUNCE	No.	999
	999
SPEED	How then? shall he marry her?	999
	999
LAUNCE	No, neither.	999
	999
SPEED	What, are they broken?	999
	999
LAUNCE	No, they are both as whole as a fish.	999
	999
SPEED	Why, then, how stands the matter with them?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it	999
	stands well with her.	999
	999
SPEED	What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.	999
	999
LAUNCE	What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My	999
	staff understands me.	999
	999
SPEED	What thou sayest?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but lean,	999
	and my staff understands me.	999
	999
SPEED	It stands under thee, indeed.	999
	999
LAUNCE	Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.	999
	999
SPEED	But tell me true, will't be a match?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no,	999
	it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.	999
	999
SPEED	The conclusion is then that it will.	999
	999
LAUNCE	Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.	999
	999
SPEED	'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest	999
	thou, that my master is become a notable lover?	999
	999
LAUNCE	I never knew him otherwise.	999
	999
SPEED	Than how?	999
	999
LAUNCE	A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.	999
	999
SPEED	Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.	999
	999
LAUNCE	Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.	999
	999
SPEED	I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.	999
	999
LAUNCE	Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself	999
	in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;	999
	if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the	999
	name of a Christian.	999
	999
SPEED	Why?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to	999

	To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;	999
	To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;	999
	And even that power which gave me first my oath	999
	Provokes me to this threefold perjury;	999
	Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.	999
	O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,	999
	Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!	999
	At first I did adore a twinkling star,	999
	But now I worship a celestial sun.	999
	Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,	999
	And he wants wit that wants resolved will	999
	To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.	999
	Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,	999
	Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd	999
	With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.	999
	I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;	999
	But there I leave to love where I should love.	999
	Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:	999
	If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;	999
	If I lose them, thus find I by their loss	999
	For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.	999
	I to myself am dearer than a friend,	999
	For love is still most precious in itself;	999
	And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--	999
	Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.	999
	I will forget that Julia is alive,	999
	Remembering that my love to her is dead;	999
	And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,	999
	Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.	999
	I cannot now prove constant to myself,	999
	Without some treachery used to Valentine.	999
	This night he meaneth with a corded ladder	999
	To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,	999
	Myself in counsel, his competitor.	999
	Now presently I'll give her father notice	999
	Of their disguising and pretended flight;	999
	Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;	999
	For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;	999
	But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross	999
	By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.	999
	Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,	999
	As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE VII	Verona. JULIA'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter JULIA and LUCETTA]	999
	999
JULIA	Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;	999
	And even in kind love I do conjure thee,	999
	Who art the table wherein all my thoughts	999
	Are visibly character'd and engraved,	999
	To lesson me and tell me some good mean	999
	How, with my honour, I may undertake	999
	A journey to my loving Proteus.	999
	999
LUCETTA	Alas, the way is wearisome and long!	999
	999
JULIA	A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary	999
	To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;	999
	Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,	999
	And when the flight is made to one so dear,	999
	Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.	999
	999
LUCETTA	Better forbear till Proteus make return.	999
	999
JULIA	O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?	999
	Pity the dearth that I have pined in,	999
	By longing for that food so long a time.	999
	Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,	999
	Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow	999
	As seek to quench the fire of love with words.	999
	999
LUCETTA	I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,	999
	But qualify the fire's extreme rage,	999
	Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.	999
	999
JULIA	The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.	999
	The current that with gentle murmur glides,	999
	Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;	999
	But when his fair course is not hindered,	999
	He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,	999
	Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge	999
	He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,	999
	And so by many winding nooks he strays	999
	With willing sport to the wild ocean.	999
	Then let me go and hinder not my course	999
	I'll be as patient as a gentle stream	999
	And make a pastime of each weary step,	999
	Till the last step have brought me to my love;	999
	And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil	999
	A blessed soul doth in Elysium.	999
	999
LUCETTA	But in what habit will you go along?	999
	999
JULIA	Not like a woman; for I would prevent	999
	The loose encounters of lascivious men:	999
	Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds	999
	As may beseem some well-reputed page.	999
	999
LUCETTA	Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.	999
	999
JULIA	No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings	999
	With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.	999
	To be fantastic may become a youth	999
	Of greater time than I shall show to be.	999
	999
LUCETTA	What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?	999
	999
JULIA	That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,	999
	What compass will you wear your farthingale?'	999
	Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.	999
	999
LUCETTA	You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.	999
	999
JULIA	Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.	999
	999
LUCETTA	A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,	999
	Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.	999
	999
JULIA	Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have	999
	What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.	999
	But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me	999
	For undertaking so unstaid a journey?	999
	I fear me, it will make me scandalized.	999
	999
LUCETTA	If you think so, then stay at home and go not.	999
	999
JULIA	Nay, that I will not.	999
	999
LUCETTA	Then never dream on infamy, but go.	999
	If Proteus like your journey when you come,	999
	No matter who's displeased when you are gone:	999
	I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.	999
	999
JULIA	That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:	999
	A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears	999
	And instances of infinite of love	999
	Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.	999
	999
LUCETTA	All these are servants to deceitful men.	999
	999
JULIA	Base men, that use them to so base effect!	999
	But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth	999
	His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,	999
	His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,	999
	His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,	999
	His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.	999
	999
LUCETTA	Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!	999
	999
JULIA	Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong	999
	To bear a hard opinion of his truth:	999
	Only deserve my love by loving him;	999
	And presently go with me to my chamber,	999
	To take a note of what I stand in need of,	999
	To furnish me upon my longing journey.	999
	All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,	999
	My goods, my lands, my reputation;	999
	Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.	999
	Come, answer not, but to it presently!	999
	I am impatient of my tarriance.	999

	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA	999
	999
	999
ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Milan. The DUKE's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS]	999
	999
DUKE	Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;	999
	We have some secrets to confer about.	999
	999
	[Exit THURIO]	999
	999
	Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?	999
	999
PROTEUS	My gracious lord, that which I would discover	999
	The law of friendship bids me to conceal;	999
	But when I call to mind your gracious favours	999
	Done to me, undeserving as I am,	999
	My duty pricks me on to utter that	999
	Which else no worldly good should draw from me.	999
	Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,	999
	This night intends to steal away your daughter:	999
	Myself am one made privy to the plot.	999
	I know you have determined to bestow her	999
	On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;	999
	And should she thus be stol'n away from you,	999
	It would be much vexation to your age.	999
	Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose	999
	To cross my friend in his intended drift	999
	Than, by concealing it, heap on your head	999
	A pack of sorrows which would press you down,	999
	Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.	999
	999
DUKE	Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;	999
	Which to requite, command me while I live.	999
	This love of theirs myself have often seen,	999
	Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,	999
	And oftentimes have purposed to forbid	999
	Sir Valentine her company and my court:	999
	But fearing lest my jealous aim might err	999
	And so unworthily disgrace the man,	999
	A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,	999
	I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find	999
	That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.	999
	And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,	999
	Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,	999
	I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,	999
	The key whereof myself have ever kept;	999
	And thence she cannot be convey'd away.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean	999
	How he her chamber-window will ascend	999
	And with a corded ladder fetch her down;	999
	For which the youthful lover now is gone	999
	And this way comes he with it presently;	999
	Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.	999
	But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly	999
	That my discovery be not aimed at;	999
	For love of you, not hate unto my friend,	999
	Hath made me publisher of this pretence.	999
	999
DUKE	Upon mine honour, he shall never know	999
	That I had any light from thee of this.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter VALENTINE]	999
	999
DUKE	Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Please it your grace, there is a messenger	999
	That stays to bear my letters to my friends,	999
	And I am going to deliver them.	999
	999
DUKE	Be they of much import?	999
	999
VALENTINE	The tenor of them doth but signify	999
	My health and happy being at your court.	999
	999
DUKE	Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;	999
	I am to break with thee of some affairs	999
	That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.	999
	'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought	999
	To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.	999
	999
VALENTINE	I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match	999
	Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman	999
	Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities	999
	Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:	999
	Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?	999
	999
DUKE	No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,	999
	Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,	999
	Neither regarding that she is my child	999
	Nor fearing me as if I were her father;	999
	And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,	999
	Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;	999
	And, where I thought the remnant of mine age	999
	Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,	999
	I now am full resolved to take a wife	999
	And turn her out to who will take her in:	999
	Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;	999
	For me and my possessions she esteems not.	999
	999
VALENTINE	What would your Grace have me to do in this?	999
	999
DUKE	There is a lady in Verona here	999
	Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy	999
	And nought esteems my aged eloquence:	999
	Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--	999
	For long agone I have forgot to court;	999
	Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--	999
	How and which way I may bestow myself	999
	To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:	999
	Dumb jewels often in their silent kind	999
	More than quick words do move a woman's mind.	999
	999
DUKE	But she did scorn a present that I sent her.	999
	999
VALENTINE	A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.	999
	Send her another; never give her o'er;	999
	For scorn at first makes after-love the more.	999
	If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,	999
	But rather to beget more love in you:	999
	If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;	999
	For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.	999
	Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;	999
	For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'	999
	Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;	999
	Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.	999
	That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,	999
	If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.	999
	999
DUKE	But she I mean is promised by her friends	999
	Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,	999
	And kept severely from resort of men,	999
	That no man hath access by day to her.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Why, then, I would resort to her by night.	999
	999
DUKE	Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,	999
	That no man hath recourse to her by night.	999
	999
VALENTINE	What lets but one may enter at her window?	999
	999
DUKE	Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,	999
	And built so shelving that one cannot climb it	999
	Without apparent hazard of his life.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,	999
	To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,	999
	Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,	999
	So bold Leander would adventure it.	999
	999
DUKE	Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,	999
	Advise me where I may have such a ladder.	999
	999
VALENTINE	When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.	999
	999
DUKE	This very night; for Love is like a child,	999
	That longs for every thing that he can come by.	999
	999
VALENTINE	By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.	999
	999
DUKE	But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:	999
	How shall I best convey the ladder thither?	999
	999
VALENTINE	It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it	999
	Under a cloak that is of any length.	999
	999
DUKE	A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Ay, my good lord.	999
	999
DUKE	                  Then let me see thy cloak:	999
	I'll get me one of such another length.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE	How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?	999
	I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.	999
	What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!	999
	And here an engine fit for my proceeding.	999
	I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,	999
	And slaves they are to me that send them flying:	999
	O, could their master come and go as lightly,	999
	Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!	999
	My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:	999
	While I, their king, that hither them importune,	999
	Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,	999
	Because myself do want my servants' fortune:	999
	I curse myself, for they are sent by me,	999
	That they should harbour where their lord would be.'	999
	What's here?	999
	'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'	999
	'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.	999
	Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--	999
	Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car	999
	And with thy daring folly burn the world?	999
	Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?	999
	Go, base intruder! overweening slave!	999
	Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,	999
	And think my patience, more than thy desert,	999
	Is privilege for thy departure hence:	999
	Thank me for this more than for all the favours	999
	Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.	999
	But if thou linger in my territories	999
	Longer than swiftest expedition	999
	Will give thee time to leave our royal court,	999
	By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love	999
	I ever bore my daughter or thyself.	999
	Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;	999
	But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
VALENTINE	And why not death rather than living torment?	999
	To die is to be banish'd from myself;	999
	And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her	999
	Is self from self: a deadly banishment!	999
	What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?	999
	What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?	999
	Unless it be to think that she is by	999
	And feed upon the shadow of perfection	999
	Except I be by Silvia in the night,	999
	There is no music in the nightingale;	999
	Unless I look on Silvia in the day,	999
	There is no day for me to look upon;	999
	She is my essence, and I leave to be,	999
	If I be not by her fair influence	999
	Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.	999
	I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:	999
	Tarry I here, I but attend on death:	999
	But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.	999
	999
	[Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE]	999
	999
PROTEUS	Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.	999
	999
LAUNCE	Soho, soho!	999
	999
PROTEUS	What seest thou?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head	999
	but 'tis a Valentine.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Valentine?	999
	999
VALENTINE	No.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Who then? his spirit?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Neither.	999
	999
PROTEUS	What then?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Nothing.	999
	999
LAUNCE	Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?	999
	999
PROTEUS	Who wouldst thou strike?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Nothing.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Villain, forbear.	999
	999
LAUNCE	Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--	999
	999
PROTEUS	Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.	999
	999
VALENTINE	My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,	999
	So much of bad already hath possess'd them.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,	999
	For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Is Silvia dead?	999
	999
PROTEUS	No, Valentine.	999
	999
VALENTINE	No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.	999
	Hath she forsworn me?	999
	999
PROTEUS	No, Valentine.	999
	999
VALENTINE	No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.	999
	What is your news?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.	999
	999
PROTEUS	That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--	999
	From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.	999
	999
VALENTINE	O, I have fed upon this woe already,	999
	And now excess of it will make me surfeit.	999
	Doth Silvia know that I am banished?	999
	999
PROTEUS	Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom--	999
	Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--	999
	A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:	999
	Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;	999
	With them, upon her knees, her humble self;	999
	Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them	999
	As if but now they waxed pale for woe:	999
	But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,	999
	Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,	999
	Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;	999
	But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.	999
	Besides, her intercession chafed him so,	999
	When she for thy repeal was suppliant,	999
	That to close prison he commanded her,	999
	With many bitter threats of biding there.	999
	999
VALENTINE	No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st	999
	Have some malignant power upon my life:	999
	If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,	999
	As ending anthem of my endless dolour.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,	999
	And study help for that which thou lament'st.	999
	Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.	999
	Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;	999
	Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.	999
	Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that	999
	And manage it against despairing thoughts.	999
	Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;	999
	Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd	999
	Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.	999
	The time now serves not to expostulate:	999
	Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate;	999
	And, ere I part with thee, confer at large	999
	Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.	999
	As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,	999
	Regard thy danger, and along with me!	999
	999
VALENTINE	I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,	999
	Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.	999
	999
VALENTINE	O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!	999
	999
	[Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS]	999
	999
LAUNCE	I am but a fool, look you; and yet I have the wit to	999
	think my master is a kind of a knave: but that's	999
	all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now	999
	that knows me to be in love; yet I am in love; but a	999
	team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who	999
	'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman, I	999
	will not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet	999
	'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet 'tis	999
	a maid, for she is her master's maid, and serves for	999
	wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel;	999
	which is much in a bare Christian.	999
	999
	[Pulling out a paper]	999
	999
	Here is the cate-log of her condition.	999
	'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why, a horse	999
	can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only	999
	carry; therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item:	999
	She can milk;' look you, a sweet virtue in a maid	999
	with clean hands.	999
	999
	[Enter SPEED]	999
	999
SPEED	How now, Signior Launce! what news with your	999
	mastership?	999
	999
LAUNCE	With my master's ship? why, it is at sea.	999
	999
SPEED	Well, your old vice still; mistake the word. What	999
	news, then, in your paper?	999
	999
LAUNCE	The blackest news that ever thou heardest.	999
	999
SPEED	Why, man, how black?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Why, as black as ink.	999
	999
SPEED	Let me read them.	999
	999
LAUNCE	Fie on thee, jolt-head! thou canst not read.	999
	999
SPEED	Thou liest; I can.	999
	999
LAUNCE	I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee?	999
	999
SPEED	Marry, the son of my grandfather.	999
	999
LAUNCE	O illiterate loiterer! it was the son of thy	999
	grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.	999
	999
SPEED	Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.	999
	999
LAUNCE	There; and St. Nicholas be thy speed!	999
	999
SPEED	[Reads]  'Imprimis: She can milk.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	Ay, that she can.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She brews good ale.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	And thereof comes the proverb: 'Blessing of your	999
	heart, you brew good ale.'	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She can sew.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	That's as much as to say, Can she so?	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She can knit.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when	999
	she can knit him a stock?	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She can wash and scour.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	A special virtue: for then she need not be washed	999
	and scoured.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She can spin.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can	999
	spin for her living.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	That's as much as to say, bastard virtues; that,	999
	indeed, know not their fathers and therefore have no names.	999
	999
SPEED	'Here follow her vices.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	Close at the heels of her virtues.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She is not to be kissed fasting in respect	999
	of her breath.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	That makes amends for her sour breath.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She is slow in words.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	O villain, that set this down among her vices! To	999
	be slow in words is a woman's only virtue: I pray	999
	thee, out with't, and place it for her chief virtue.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She is proud.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy, and cannot	999
	be ta'en from her.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She hath no teeth.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She is curst.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She will often praise her liquor.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will not, I	999
	will; for good things should be praised.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She is too liberal.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	Of her tongue she cannot, for that's writ down she	999
	is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that	999
	I'll keep shut: now, of another thing she may, and	999
	that cannot I help. Well, proceed.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults	999
	than hairs, and more wealth than faults.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	Stop there; I'll have her: she was mine, and not	999
	mine, twice or thrice in that last article.	999
	Rehearse that once more.	999
	999
SPEED	'Item: She hath more hair than wit,'--	999
	999
LAUNCE	More hair than wit? It may be; I'll prove it. The	999
	cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it	999
	is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit	999
	is more than the wit, for the greater hides the	999
	less. What's next?	999
	999
SPEED	'And more faults than hairs,'--	999
	999
LAUNCE	That's monstrous: O, that that were out!	999
	999
SPEED	'And more wealth than faults.'	999
	999
LAUNCE	Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well,	999
	I'll have her; and if it be a match, as nothing is	999
	impossible,--	999
	999
SPEED	What then?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Why, then will I tell thee--that thy master stays	999
	for thee at the North-gate.	999
	999
SPEED	For me?	999
	999
LAUNCE	For thee! ay, who art thou? he hath stayed for a	999
	better man than thee.	999
	999
SPEED	And must I go to him?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long	999
	that going will scarce serve the turn.	999
	999
SPEED	Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LAUNCE	Now will he be swinged for reading my letter; an	999
	unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into	999
	secrets! I'll after, to rejoice in the boy's correction.	999
	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	The same. The DUKE's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE and THURIO]	999
	999
DUKE	Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,	999
	Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.	999
	999
THURIO	Since his exile she hath despised me most,	999
	Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,	999
	That I am desperate of obtaining her.	999
	999
DUKE	This weak impress of love is as a figure	999
	Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat	999
	Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.	999
	A little time will melt her frozen thoughts	999
	And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.	999
	999
	[Enter PROTEUS]	999
	999
	How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman	999
	According to our proclamation gone?	999
	999
PROTEUS	Gone, my good lord.	999
	999
DUKE	My daughter takes his going grievously.	999
	999
PROTEUS	A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.	999
	999
DUKE	So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.	999
	Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--	999
	For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--	999
	Makes me the better to confer with thee.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Longer than I prove loyal to your grace	999
	Let me not live to look upon your grace.	999
	999
DUKE	Thou know'st how willingly I would effect	999
	The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.	999
	999
PROTEUS	I do, my lord.	999
	999
DUKE	And also, I think, thou art not ignorant	999
	How she opposes her against my will	999
	999
PROTEUS	She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.	999
	999
DUKE	Ay, and perversely she persevers so.	999
	What might we do to make the girl forget	999
	The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?	999
	999
PROTEUS	The best way is to slander Valentine	999
	With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,	999
	Three things that women highly hold in hate.	999
	999
DUKE	Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Ay, if his enemy deliver it:	999
	Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken	999
	By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.	999
	999
DUKE	Then you must undertake to slander him.	999
	999
PROTEUS	And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:	999
	'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,	999
	Especially against his very friend.	999
	999
DUKE	Where your good word cannot advantage him,	999
	Your slander never can endamage him;	999
	Therefore the office is indifferent,	999
	Being entreated to it by your friend.	999
	999
PROTEUS	You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it	999
	By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,	999
	She shall not long continue love to him.	999
	But say this weed her love from Valentine,	999
	It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.	999
	999
THURIO	Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,	999
	Lest it should ravel and be good to none,	999
	You must provide to bottom it on me;	999
	Which must be done by praising me as much	999
	As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.	999
	999
DUKE	And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,	999
	Because we know, on Valentine's report,	999
	You are already Love's firm votary	999
	And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.	999
	Upon this warrant shall you have access	999
	Where you with Silvia may confer at large;	999
	For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,	999
	And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;	999
	Where you may temper her by your persuasion	999
	To hate young Valentine and love my friend.	999
	999
PROTEUS	As much as I can do, I will effect:	999
	But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;	999
	You must lay lime to tangle her desires	999
	By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes	999
	Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.	999
	999
DUKE	Ay,	999
	Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Say that upon the altar of her beauty	999
	You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:	999
	Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears	999
	Moist it again, and frame some feeling line	999
	That may discover such integrity:	999
	For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,	999
	Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,	999
	Make tigers tame and huge leviathans	999
	Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.	999
	After your dire-lamenting elegies,	999
	Visit by night your lady's chamber-window	999
	With some sweet concert; to their instruments	999
	Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence	999
	Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.	999
	This, or else nothing, will inherit her.	999
	999
DUKE	This discipline shows thou hast been in love.	999
	999
THURIO	And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.	999
	Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,	999
	Let us into the city presently	999
	To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.	999
	I have a sonnet that will serve the turn	999
	To give the onset to thy good advice.	999
	999
DUKE	About it, gentlemen!	999
	999
PROTEUS	We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,	999
	And afterward determine our proceedings.	999
	999
DUKE	Even now about it! I will pardon you.	999

SCENE I	The frontiers of Mantua. A forest.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter certain Outlaws]	999
	999
First Outlaw	Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.	999
	999
Second Outlaw	If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.	999
	999
	[Enter VALENTINE and SPEED]	999
	999
Third Outlaw	Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:	999
	If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.	999
	999
SPEED	Sir, we are undone; these are the villains	999
	That all the travellers do fear so much.	999
	999
VALENTINE	My friends,--	999
	999
First Outlaw	That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.	999
	999
Second Outlaw	Peace! we'll hear him.	999
	999
Third Outlaw	Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Then know that I have little wealth to lose:	999
	A man I am cross'd with adversity;	999
	My riches are these poor habiliments,	999
	Of which if you should here disfurnish me,	999
	You take the sum and substance that I have.	999
	999
Second Outlaw	Whither travel you?	999
	999
VALENTINE	To Verona.	999
	999
First Outlaw	Whence came you?	999
	999
VALENTINE	From Milan.	999
	999
Third Outlaw	Have you long sojourned there?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,	999
	If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.	999
	999
First Outlaw	What, were you banish'd thence?	999
	999
VALENTINE	I was.	999
	999
Second Outlaw	For what offence?	999
	999
VALENTINE	For that which now torments me to rehearse:	999
	I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;	999
	But yet I slew him manfully in fight,	999
	Without false vantage or base treachery.	999
	999
First Outlaw	Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.	999
	But were you banish'd for so small a fault?	999
	999
VALENTINE	I was, and held me glad of such a doom.	999
	999
Second Outlaw	Have you the tongues?	999
	999
VALENTINE	My youthful travel therein made me happy,	999
	Or else I often had been miserable.	999
	999
Third Outlaw	By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,	999
	This fellow were a king for our wild faction!	999
	999
First Outlaw	We'll have him. Sirs, a word.	999
	999
SPEED	Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Peace, villain!	999
	999
Second Outlaw	Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Nothing but my fortune.	999
	999
Third Outlaw	Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,	999
	Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth	999
	Thrust from the company of awful men:	999
	Myself was from Verona banished	999
	For practising to steal away a lady,	999
	An heir, and near allied unto the duke.	999
	999
Second Outlaw	And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,	999
	Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.	999
	999
First Outlaw	And I for such like petty crimes as these,	999
	But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,	999
	That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;	999
	And partly, seeing you are beautified	999
	With goodly shape and by your own report	999
	A linguist and a man of such perfection	999
	As we do in our quality much want--	999
	999
Second Outlaw	Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,	999
	Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:	999
	Are you content to be our general?	999
	To make a virtue of necessity	999
	And live, as we do, in this wilderness?	999
	999
Third Outlaw	What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?	999
	Say ay, and be the captain of us all:	999
	We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,	999
	Love thee as our commander and our king.	999
	999
First Outlaw	But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.	999
	999
Second Outlaw	Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.	999
	999
VALENTINE	I take your offer and will live with you,	999
	Provided that you do no outrages	999
	On silly women or poor passengers.	999
	999
Third Outlaw	No, we detest such vile base practises.	999
	Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,	999
	And show thee all the treasure we have got,	999
	Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Milan. Outside the DUKE's palace, under SILVIA's chamber.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PROTEUS]	999
	999
PROTEUS	Already have I been false to Valentine	999
	And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.	999
	Under the colour of commending him,	999
	I have access my own love to prefer:	999
	But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,	999
	To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.	999
	When I protest true loyalty to her,	999
	She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;	999
	When to her beauty I commend my vows,	999
	She bids me think how I have been forsworn	999
	In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:	999
	And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,	999
	The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,	999
	Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,	999
	The more it grows and fawneth on her still.	999
	But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,	999
	And give some evening music to her ear.	999
	999
	[Enter THURIO and Musicians]	999
	999
THURIO	How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?	999
	999
PROTEUS	Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love	999
	Will creep in service where it cannot go.	999
	999
THURIO	Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.	999
	999
THURIO	Who? Silvia?	999
	999
PROTEUS	                  Ay, Silvia; for your sake.	999
	999
THURIO	I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,	999
	Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.	999
	999
	[Enter, at a distance, Host, and JULIA in boy's clothes]	999
	999
Host	Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I	999
	pray you, why is it?	999
	999
JULIA	Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.	999
	999
Host	Come, we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where	999
	you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.	999
	999
JULIA	But shall I hear him speak?	999
	999
Host	Ay, that you shall.	999
	999
JULIA	That will be music.	999
	999
	[Music plays]	999
	999
Host	Hark, hark!	999
	999
JULIA	Is he among these?	999
	999
Host	Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em.	999
	999
	SONG.	999
	Who is Silvia? what is she,	999
	That all our swains commend her?	999
	Holy, fair and wise is she;	999
	The heaven such grace did lend her,	999
	That she might admired be.	999
	999
	Is she kind as she is fair?	999
	For beauty lives with kindness.	999
	Love doth to her eyes repair,	999
	To help him of his blindness,	999
	And, being help'd, inhabits there.	999
	999
	Then to Silvia let us sing,	999
	That Silvia is excelling;	999
	She excels each mortal thing	999
	Upon the dull earth dwelling:	999
	To her let us garlands bring.	999
	999
Host	How now! are you sadder than you were before? How	999
	do you, man? the music likes you not.	999
	999
JULIA	You mistake; the musician likes me not.	999
	999
Host	Why, my pretty youth?	999
	999
JULIA	He plays false, father.	999
	999
Host	How? out of tune on the strings?	999
	999
JULIA	Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very	999
	heart-strings.	999
	999
Host	You have a quick ear.	999
	999
JULIA	Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.	999
	999
Host	I perceive you delight not in music.	999
	999
JULIA	Not a whit, when it jars so.	999
	999
Host	Hark, what fine change is in the music!	999
	999
JULIA	Ay, that change is the spite.	999
	999
Host	You would have them always play but one thing?	999
	999
JULIA	I would always have one play but one thing.	999
	But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on	999
	Often resort unto this gentlewoman?	999
	999
Host	I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved	999
	her out of all nick.	999
	999
JULIA	Where is Launce?	999
	999
Host	Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his	999
	master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.	999
	999
JULIA	Peace! stand aside: the company parts.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead	999
	That you shall say my cunning drift excels.	999
	999
THURIO	Where meet we?	999
	999
PROTEUS	                  At Saint Gregory's well.	999

THURIO	Farewell.	999

	[Exeunt THURIO and Musicians]	999

	[Enter SILVIA above]	999
	999
PROTEUS	Madam, good even to your ladyship.	999
	999
SILVIA	I thank you for your music, gentlemen.	999
	Who is that that spake?	999
	999
PROTEUS	One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,	999
	You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.	999
	999
SILVIA	Sir Proteus, as I take it.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.	999
	999
SILVIA	What's your will?	999
	999
PROTEUS	                  That I may compass yours.	999
	999
SILVIA	You have your wish; my will is even this:	999
	That presently you hie you home to bed.	999
	Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!	999
	Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,	999
	To be seduced by thy flattery,	999
	That hast deceived so many with thy vows?	999
	Return, return, and make thy love amends.	999
	For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,	999
	I am so far from granting thy request	999
	That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,	999
	And by and by intend to chide myself	999
	Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.	999
	999
PROTEUS	I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;	999
	But she is dead.	999
	999
JULIA	[Aside]        'Twere false, if I should speak it;	999
	For I am sure she is not buried.	999
	999
SILVIA	Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend	999
	Survives; to whom, thyself art witness,	999
	I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed	999
	To wrong him with thy importunacy?	999
	999
PROTEUS	I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.	999
	999
SILVIA	And so suppose am I; for in his grave	999
	Assure thyself my love is buried.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.	999
	999
SILVIA	Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,	999
	Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.	999
	999
JULIA	[Aside]  He heard not that.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,	999
	Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,	999
	The picture that is hanging in your chamber;	999
	To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:	999
	For since the substance of your perfect self	999
	Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;	999
	And to your shadow will I make true love.	999
	999
JULIA	[Aside]  If 'twere a substance, you would, sure,	999
	deceive it,	999
	And make it but a shadow, as I am.	999
	999
SILVIA	I am very loath to be your idol, sir;	999
	But since your falsehood shall become you well	999
	To worship shadows and adore false shapes,	999
	Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:	999
	And so, good rest.	999
	999
PROTEUS	                  As wretches have o'ernight	999
	That wait for execution in the morn.	999

JULIA	Host, will you go?	999
	999
Host	By my halidom, I was fast asleep.	999
	999
JULIA	Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?	999
	999
Host	Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost	999
	day.	999
	999
JULIA	Not so; but it hath been the longest night	999
	That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.	999

EGLAMOUR	This is the hour that Madam Silvia	999

	There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.	999
	Madam, madam!	999
	999
	[Enter SILVIA above]	999
	999
SILVIA	                  Who calls?	999
	999
EGLAMOUR	Your servant and your friend;	999
	One that attends your ladyship's command.	999
	999
SILVIA	Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.	999
	999
EGLAMOUR	As many, worthy lady, to yourself:	999
	According to your ladyship's impose,	999
	I am thus early come to know what service	999
	It is your pleasure to command me in.	999
	999
SILVIA	O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--	999
	Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--	999
	Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd:	999
	Thou art not ignorant what dear good will	999
	I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,	999
	Nor how my father would enforce me marry	999
	Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.	999
	Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say	999
	No grief did ever come so near thy heart	999
	As when thy lady and thy true love died,	999
	Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.	999
	Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,	999
	To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;	999
	And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,	999
	I do desire thy worthy company,	999
	Upon whose faith and honour I repose.	999
	Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,	999
	But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,	999
	And on the justice of my flying hence,	999
	To keep me from a most unholy match,	999
	Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.	999
	I do desire thee, even from a heart	999
	As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,	999
	To bear me company and go with me:	999
	If not, to hide what I have said to thee,	999
	That I may venture to depart alone.	999
	999
EGLAMOUR	Madam, I pity much your grievances;	999
	Which since I know they virtuously are placed,	999
	I give consent to go along with you,	999
	Recking as little what betideth me	999
	As much I wish all good befortune you.	999
	When will you go?	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE IV	The same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LAUNCE, with his his Dog]	999
	999
LAUNCE	When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,	999
	look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a	999
	puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or	999
	four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.	999
	I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,	999
	'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver	999
	him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;	999
	and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he	999
	steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:	999
	O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself	999
	in all companies! I would have, as one should say,	999
	one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,	999
	as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had	999
	more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,	999
	I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I	999
	live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He	999
	thrusts me himself into the company of three or four	999
	gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had	999
	not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but	999
	all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says	999
	one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him	999
	out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.	999
	I, having been acquainted with the smell before,	999
	knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that	999
	whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip	999
	the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him	999
	the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you	999
	wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out	999
	of the chamber. How many masters would do this for	999
	his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the	999
	stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had	999
	been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese	999
	he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.	999
	Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the	999
	trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam	999
	Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I	999
	do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make	999
	water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst	999
	thou ever see me do such a trick?	999
	999
	[Enter PROTEUS and JULIA]	999
	999
PROTEUS	Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well	999
	And will employ thee in some service presently.	999
	999
JULIA	In what you please: I'll do what I can.	999
	999
PROTEUS	I hope thou wilt.	999
	999
	[To LAUNCE]	999
	999
	How now, you whoreson peasant!	999
	Where have you been these two days loitering?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.	999
	999
PROTEUS	And what says she to my little jewel?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you	999
	currish thanks is good enough for such a present.	999
	999
PROTEUS	But she received my dog?	999
	999
LAUNCE	No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him	999
	back again.	999
	999
PROTEUS	What, didst thou offer her this from me?	999
	999
LAUNCE	Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by	999
	the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I	999
	offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of	999
	yours, and therefore the gift the greater.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,	999
	Or ne'er return again into my sight.	999
	Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?	999
	999
	[Exit LAUNCE]	999
	999
	A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!	999
	Sebastian, I have entertained thee,	999
	Partly that I have need of such a youth	999
	That can with some discretion do my business,	999
	For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,	999
	But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,	999
	Which, if my augury deceive me not,	999
	Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:	999
	Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.	999
	Go presently and take this ring with thee,	999
	Deliver it to Madam Silvia:	999
	She loved me well deliver'd it to me.	999
	999
JULIA	It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.	999
	She is dead, belike?	999
	999
PROTEUS	Not so; I think she lives.	999
	999
JULIA	Alas!	999
	999
PROTEUS	Why dost thou cry 'alas'?	999
	999
JULIA	I cannot choose	999
	But pity her.	999
	999
PROTEUS	                  Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?	999
	999
JULIA	Because methinks that she loved you as well	999
	As you do love your lady Silvia:	999
	She dreams of him that has forgot her love;	999
	You dote on her that cares not for your love.	999
	'Tis pity love should be so contrary;	999
	And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'	999
	999
PROTEUS	Well, give her that ring and therewithal	999
	This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady	999
	I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.	999
	Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,	999
	Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
JULIA	How many women would do such a message?	999
	Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd	999
	A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.	999
	Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him	999
	That with his very heart despiseth me?	999
	Because he loves her, he despiseth me;	999
	Because I love him I must pity him.	999
	This ring I gave him when he parted from me,	999
	To bind him to remember my good will;	999
	And now am I, unhappy messenger,	999
	To plead for that which I would not obtain,	999
	To carry that which I would have refused,	999
	To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.	999
	I am my master's true-confirmed love;	999
	But cannot be true servant to my master,	999
	Unless I prove false traitor to myself.	999
	Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly	999
	As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.	999
	999
	[Enter SILVIA, attended]	999
	999
	Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean	999
	To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.	999
	999
SILVIA	What would you with her, if that I be she?	999
	999
JULIA	If you be she, I do entreat your patience	999
	To hear me speak the message I am sent on.	999
	999
SILVIA	From whom?	999
	999
JULIA	From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.	999
	999
SILVIA	O, he sends you for a picture.	999
	999
JULIA	Ay, madam.	999
	999
SILVIA	Ursula, bring my picture here.	999
	Go give your master this: tell him from me,	999
	One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,	999
	Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.	999
	999
JULIA	Madam, please you peruse this letter.--	999
	Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised	999
	Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:	999
	This is the letter to your ladyship.	999
	999
SILVIA	I pray thee, let me look on that again.	999
	999
JULIA	It may not be; good madam, pardon me.	999
	999
SILVIA	There, hold!	999
	I will not look upon your master's lines:	999
	I know they are stuff'd with protestations	999
	And full of new-found oaths; which he will break	999
	As easily as I do tear his paper.	999
	999
JULIA	Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.	999
	999
SILVIA	The more shame for him that he sends it me;	999
	For I have heard him say a thousand times	999
	His Julia gave it him at his departure.	999
	Though his false finger have profaned the ring,	999
	Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.	999
	999
JULIA	She thanks you.	999
	999
SILVIA	What say'st thou?	999
	999
JULIA	I thank you, madam, that you tender her.	999
	Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.	999
	999
SILVIA	Dost thou know her?	999
	999
JULIA	Almost as well as I do know myself:	999
	To think upon her woes I do protest	999
	That I have wept a hundred several times.	999
	999
SILVIA	Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.	999
	999
JULIA	I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.	999
	999
SILVIA	Is she not passing fair?	999
	999
JULIA	She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:	999
	When she did think my master loved her well,	999
	She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:	999
	But since she did neglect her looking-glass	999
	And threw her sun-expelling mask away,	999
	The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks	999
	And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,	999
	That now she is become as black as I.	999
	999
SILVIA	How tall was she?	999
	999
JULIA	About my stature; for at Pentecost,	999
	When all our pageants of delight were play'd,	999
	Our youth got me to play the woman's part,	999
	And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,	999
	Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,	999
	As if the garment had been made for me:	999
	Therefore I know she is about my height.	999
	And at that time I made her weep agood,	999
	For I did play a lamentable part:	999
	Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning	999
	For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;	999
	Which I so lively acted with my tears	999
	That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,	999
	Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead	999
	If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!	999
	999
SILVIA	She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.	999
	Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!	999
	I weep myself to think upon thy words.	999
	Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this	999
	For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.	999
	Farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit SILVIA, with attendants]	999
	999
JULIA	And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.	999
	A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful	999
	I hope my master's suit will be but cold,	999
	Since she respects my mistress' love so much.	999
	Alas, how love can trifle with itself!	999
	Here is her picture: let me see; I think,	999
	If I had such a tire, this face of mine	999
	Were full as lovely as is this of hers:	999
	And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,	999
	Unless I flatter with myself too much.	999
	Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:	999
	If that be all the difference in his love,	999
	I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.	999
	Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:	999
	Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.	999
	What should it be that he respects in her	999
	But I can make respective in myself,	999
	If this fond Love were not a blinded god?	999
	Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,	999
	For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,	999
	Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!	999
	And, were there sense in his idolatry,	999
	My substance should be statue in thy stead.	999
	I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,	999
	That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,	999
	I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes	999
	To make my master out of love with thee!	999

PROTEUS	O, sir, I find her milder than she was;	999
	And yet she takes exceptions at your person.	999
	999
THURIO	What, that my leg is too long?	999

	it loathes.	999
	999
THURIO	What says she to my face?	999
	999
PROTEUS	She says it is a fair one.	999
	999
THURIO	Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.	999
	999
PROTEUS	But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,	999
	Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.	999
	999
JULIA	[Aside]  'Tis true; such pearls as put out	999
	ladies' eyes;	999
	For I had rather wink than look on them.	999
	999
THURIO	How likes she my discourse?	999
	999
PROTEUS	Ill, when you talk of war.	999
	999
THURIO	But well, when I discourse of love and peace?	999
	999
JULIA	[Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.	999
	999
THURIO	What says she to my valour?	999
	999
PROTEUS	O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.	999
	999
JULIA	[Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.	999
	999
THURIO	What says she to my birth?	999
	999
PROTEUS	That you are well derived.	999
	999
JULIA	[Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.	999
	999
THURIO	Considers she my possessions?	999
	999
PROTEUS	O, ay; and pities them.	999
	999
THURIO	Wherefore?	999
	999
JULIA	[Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.	999
	999
PROTEUS	That they are out by lease.	999
	999
JULIA	Here comes the duke.	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE]	999
	999
DUKE	How now, Sir Proteus! how now, Thurio!	999
	Which of you saw Sir Eglamour of late?	999
	999
THURIO	Not I.	999
	999
PROTEUS	     Nor I.	999
	999
DUKE	          Saw you my daughter?	999
	999
PROTEUS	Neither.	999
	999
DUKE	Why then,	999
	She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;	999
	And Eglamour is in her company.	999
	'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,	999
	As he in penance wander'd through the forest;	999
	Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,	999
	But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;	999
	Besides, she did intend confession	999
	At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;	999
	These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.	999
	Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,	999
	But mount you presently and meet with me	999
	Upon the rising of the mountain-foot	999
	That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:	999
	Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
THURIO	Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,	999
	That flies her fortune when it follows her.	999
	I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour	999
	Than for the love of reckless Silvia.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PROTEUS	And I will follow, more for Silvia's love	999
	Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
JULIA	And I will follow, more to cross that love	999
	Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.	999

	999
First Outlaw	Come, come,	999
	Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.	999
	999
SILVIA	A thousand more mischances than this one	999
	Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.	999
	999
Second Outlaw	Come, bring her away.	999
	999
First Outlaw	Where is the gentleman that was with her?	999
	999
Third Outlaw	Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,	999
	But Moyses and Valerius follow him.	999
	Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;	999
	There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;	999
	The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.	999
	999
First Outlaw	Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:	999
	Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,	999
	And will not use a woman lawlessly.	999

SCENE IV	Another part of the forest.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter VALENTINE]	999
	999
VALENTINE	How use doth breed a habit in a man!	999
	This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,	999
	I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:	999
	Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,	999
	And to the nightingale's complaining notes	999
	Tune my distresses and record my woes.	999
	O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,	999
	Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,	999
	Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall	999
	And leave no memory of what it was!	999
	Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;	999
	Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!	999
	What halloing and what stir is this to-day?	999
	These are my mates, that make their wills their law,	999
	Have some unhappy passenger in chase.	999
	They love me well; yet I have much to do	999
	To keep them from uncivil outrages.	999
	Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA]	999
	999
PROTEUS	Madam, this service I have done for you,	999
	Though you respect not aught your servant doth,	999
	To hazard life and rescue you from him	999
	That would have forced your honour and your love;	999
	Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;	999
	A smaller boon than this I cannot beg	999
	And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.	999
	999
VALENTINE	[Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!	999
	Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.	999
	999
SILVIA	O miserable, unhappy that I am!	999
	999
PROTEUS	Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;	999
	But by my coming I have made you happy.	999
	999
SILVIA	By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.	999
	999
JULIA	[Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.	999
	999
SILVIA	Had I been seized by a hungry lion,	999
	I would have been a breakfast to the beast,	999
	Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.	999
	O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,	999
	Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!	999
	And full as much, for more there cannot be,	999
	I do detest false perjured Proteus.	999
	Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.	999
	999
PROTEUS	What dangerous action, stood it next to death,	999
	Would I not undergo for one calm look!	999
	O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,	999
	When women cannot love where they're beloved!	999
	999
SILVIA	When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.	999
	Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,	999
	For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith	999
	Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths	999
	Descended into perjury, to love me.	999
	Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;	999
	And that's far worse than none; better have none	999
	Than plural faith which is too much by one:	999
	Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!	999
	999
PROTEUS	In love	999
	Who respects friend?	999
	999
SILVIA	All men but Proteus.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words	999
	Can no way change you to a milder form,	999
	I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,	999
	And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.	999
	999
SILVIA	O heaven!	999
	999
PROTEUS	        I'll force thee yield to my desire.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,	999
	Thou friend of an ill fashion!	999
	999
PROTEUS	Valentine!	999
	999
VALENTINE	Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,	999
	For such is a friend now; treacherous man!	999
	Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye	999
	Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say	999
	I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.	999
	Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand	999
	Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,	999
	I am sorry I must never trust thee more,	999
	But count the world a stranger for thy sake.	999
	The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,	999
	'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!	999
	999
PROTEUS	My shame and guilt confounds me.	999
	Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow	999
	Be a sufficient ransom for offence,	999
	I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer	999
	As e'er I did commit.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Then I am paid;	999
	And once again I do receive thee honest.	999
	Who by repentance is not satisfied	999
	Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.	999
	By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:	999
	And, that my love may appear plain and free,	999
	All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.	999
	999
JULIA	O me unhappy!	999
	999
	[Swoons]	999
	999
PROTEUS	Look to the boy.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?	999
	Look up; speak.	999
	999
JULIA	O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring	999
	to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Where is that ring, boy?	999
	999
JULIA	Here 'tis; this is it.	999
	999
PROTEUS	How! let me see:	999
	Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.	999
	999
JULIA	O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:	999
	This is the ring you sent to Silvia.	999
	999
PROTEUS	But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart	999
	I gave this unto Julia.	999
	999
JULIA	And Julia herself did give it me;	999
	And Julia herself hath brought it hither.	999
	999
PROTEUS	How! Julia!	999
	999
JULIA	Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,	999
	And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.	999
	How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!	999
	O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!	999
	Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me	999
	Such an immodest raiment, if shame live	999
	In a disguise of love:	999
	It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,	999
	Women to change their shapes than men their minds.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Than men their minds! 'tis true.	999
	O heaven! were man	999
	But constant, he were perfect. That one error	999
	Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:	999
	Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.	999
	What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy	999
	More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Come, come, a hand from either:	999
	Let me be blest to make this happy close;	999
	'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.	999
	999
PROTEUS	Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.	999
	999
JULIA	And I mine.	999
	999
	[Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO]	999
	999
Outlaws	A prize, a prize, a prize!	999
	999
VALENTINE	Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.	999
	Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,	999
	Banished Valentine.	999
	999
DUKE	Sir Valentine!	999
	999
THURIO	Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.	999
	999
VALENTINE	Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;	999
	Come not within the measure of my wrath;	999
	Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,	999
	Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;	999
	Take but possession of her with a touch:	999
	I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.	999
	999
THURIO	Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;	999
	I hold him but a fool that will endanger	999
	His body for a girl that loves him not:	999
	I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.	999
	999
DUKE	The more degenerate and base art thou,	999
	To make such means for her as thou hast done	999
	And leave her on such slight conditions.	999
	Now, by the honour of my ancestry,	999
	I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,	999
	And think thee worthy of an empress' love:	999
	Know then, I here forget all former griefs,	999
	Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,	999
	Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,	999
	To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,	999
	Thou art a gentleman and well derived;	999
	Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.	999
	999
VALENTINE	I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.	999
	I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,	999
	To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.	999
	999
DUKE	I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.	999
	999
VALENTINE	These banish'd men that I have kept withal	999
	Are men endued with worthy qualities:	999
	Forgive them what they have committed here	999
	And let them be recall'd from their exile:	999
	They are reformed, civil, full of good	999
	And fit for great employment, worthy lord.	999
	999
DUKE	Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:	999
	Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.	999
	Come, let us go: we will include all jars	999
	With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.	999
	999
VALENTINE	And, as we walk along, I dare be bold	999
	With our discourse to make your grace to smile.	999
	What think you of this page, my lord?	999
	999
DUKE	I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.	999
	999
VALENTINE	I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.	999
	999
DUKE	What mean you by that saying?	999
	999
VALENTINE	Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,	999
	That you will wonder what hath fortuned.	999
	Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear	999
	The story of your loves discovered:	999
	That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;	999
	One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.	999

	[Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS]	999
	999
ARCHIDAMUS	If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on	999
	the like occasion whereon my services are now on	999
	foot, you shall see, as I have said, great	999
	difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.	999
	999
CAMILLO	I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia	999
	means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.	999
	999
ARCHIDAMUS	Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be	999
	justified in our loves; for indeed--	999
	999
CAMILLO	Beseech you,--	999
	999
ARCHIDAMUS	Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:	999
	we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know	999
	not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,	999
	that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,	999
	may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse	999
	us.	999
	999
CAMILLO	You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.	999
	999
ARCHIDAMUS	Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me	999
	and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.	999
	They were trained together in their childhoods; and	999
	there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,	999
	which cannot choose but branch now. Since their	999
	more mature dignities and royal necessities made	999
	separation of their society, their encounters,	999
	though not personal, have been royally attorneyed	999
	with interchange of gifts, letters, loving	999
	embassies; that they have seemed to be together,	999
	though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and	999
	embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed	999
	winds. The heavens continue their loves!	999
	999
ARCHIDAMUS	I think there is not in the world either malice or	999
	matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable	999
	comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a	999
	gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came	999
	into my note.	999
	999
CAMILLO	I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it	999
	is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the	999
	subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on	999
	crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to	999
	see him a man.	999
	999
ARCHIDAMUS	Would they else be content to die?	999
	999
CAMILLO	Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should	999
	desire to live.	999
	999
ARCHIDAMUS	If the king had no son, they would desire to live	999
	on crutches till he had one.	999

	999
POLIXENES	Nine changes of the watery star hath been	999
	The shepherd's note since we have left our throne	999
	Without a burthen: time as long again	999
	Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;	999
	And yet we should, for perpetuity,	999
	Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,	999
	Yet standing in rich place, I multiply	999
	With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe	999
	That go before it.	999
	999
LEONTES	                  Stay your thanks a while;	999
	And pay them when you part.	999
	999
POLIXENES	Sir, that's to-morrow.	999
	I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance	999
	Or breed upon our absence; that may blow	999
	No sneaping winds at home, to make us say	999
	'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd	999
	To tire your royalty.	999
	999
LEONTES	We are tougher, brother,	999
	Than you can put us to't.	999
	999
POLIXENES	No longer stay.	999
	999
LEONTES	One seven-night longer.	999
	999
POLIXENES	Very sooth, to-morrow.	999

LEONTES	We'll part the time between's then; and in that	999
	I'll no gainsaying.	999
	999
POLIXENES	Press me not, beseech you, so.	999
	There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,	999
	So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,	999
	Were there necessity in your request, although	999
	'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs	999
	Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder	999
	Were in your love a whip to me; my stay	999
	To you a charge and trouble: to save both,	999
	Farewell, our brother.	999
	999
LEONTES	Tongue-tied, our queen?	999
	speak you.	999
	999
HERMIONE	I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until	999
	You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,	999
	Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure	999
	All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction	999
	The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,	999
	He's beat from his best ward.	999
	999
LEONTES	Well said, Hermione.	999
	999
HERMIONE	To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:	999
	But let him say so then, and let him go;	999
	But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,	999
	We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.	999
	Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure	999
	The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia	999
	You take my lord, I'll give him my commission	999
	To let him there a month behind the gest	999
	Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,	999
	I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind	999
	What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?	999
	999
POLIXENES	No, madam.	999
	999
HERMIONE	Nay, but you will?	999
	999
POLIXENES	                  I may not, verily.	999
	999
HERMIONE	Verily!	999
	You put me off with limber vows; but I,	999
	Though you would seek to unsphere the	999
	stars with oaths,	999
	Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,	999
	You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's	999
	As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?	999
	Force me to keep you as a prisoner,	999
	Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees	999
	When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?	999
	My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'	999
	One of them you shall be.	999
	999
POLIXENES	Your guest, then, madam:	999
	To be your prisoner should import offending;	999
	Which is for me less easy to commit	999
	Than you to punish.	999
	999
HERMIONE	Not your gaoler, then,	999
	But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you	999
	Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:	999
	You were pretty lordings then?	999
	999
POLIXENES	We were, fair queen,	999
	Two lads that thought there was no more behind	999
	But such a day to-morrow as to-day,	999
	And to be boy eternal.	999
	999
HERMIONE	Was not my lord	999
	The verier wag o' the two?	999
	999
POLIXENES	We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,	999
	And bleat the one at the other: what we changed	999
	Was innocence for innocence; we knew not	999
	The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd	999
	That any did. Had we pursued that life,	999
	And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd	999
	With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven	999
	Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd	999
	Hereditary ours.	999
	999
HERMIONE	                  By this we gather	999
	You have tripp'd since.	999
	999
POLIXENES	O my most sacred lady!	999
	Temptations have since then been born to's; for	999
	In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;	999
	Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes	999
	Of my young play-fellow.	999
	999
HERMIONE	Grace to boot!	999
	Of this make no conclusion, lest you say	999
	Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;	999
	The offences we have made you do we'll answer,	999
	If you first sinn'd with us and that with us	999
	You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not	999
	With any but with us.	999
	999
LEONTES	Is he won yet?	999
	999
HERMIONE	He'll stay my lord.	999
	999
LEONTES	At my request he would not.	999
	Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest	999
	To better purpose.	999
	999
HERMIONE	                                 Never?	999
	999
LEONTES	Never, but once.	999
	999
HERMIONE	What! have I twice said well? when was't before?	999
	I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's	999
	As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless	999
	Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.	999
	Our praises are our wages: you may ride's	999
	With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere	999
	With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:	999
	My last good deed was to entreat his stay:	999
	What was my first? it has an elder sister,	999
	Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!	999
	But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?	999
	Nay, let me have't; I long.	999
	999
LEONTES	Why, that was when	999
	Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,	999
	Ere I could make thee open thy white hand	999
	And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter	999
	'I am yours for ever.'	999
	999
HERMIONE	'Tis grace indeed.	999
	Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:	999
	The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;	999
	The other for some while a friend.	999
	999
LEONTES	[Aside]	Too hot, too hot!	999
	To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.	999
	I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;	999
	But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment	999
	May a free face put on, derive a liberty	999
	From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,	999
	And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;	999
	But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,	999
	As now they are, and making practised smiles,	999
	As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere	999
	The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment	999
	My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,	999
	Art thou my boy?	999
	999
MAMILLIUS	                           Ay, my good lord.	999
	999
LEONTES	I' fecks!	999
	Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast	999
	smutch'd thy nose?	999
	They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,	999
	We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:	999
	And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf	999
	Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling	999
	Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!	999
	Art thou my calf?	999
	999
MAMILLIUS	                  Yes, if you will, my lord.	999
	999
LEONTES	Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,	999
	To be full like me: yet they say we are	999
	Almost as like as eggs; women say so,	999
	That will say anything but were they false	999
	As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false	999
	As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes	999
	No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true	999
	To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,	999
	Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!	999
	Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--	999
	Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:	999
	Thou dost make possible things not so held,	999
	Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--	999
	With what's unreal thou coactive art,	999
	And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent	999
	Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,	999
	And that beyond commission, and I find it,	999
	And that to the infection of my brains	999
	And hardening of my brows.	999
	999
POLIXENES	What means Sicilia?	999
	999
HERMIONE	He something seems unsettled.	999
	999
POLIXENES	How, my lord!	999
	What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?	999
	999
HERMIONE	You look as if you held a brow of much distraction	999
	Are you moved, my lord?	999
	999
LEONTES	No, in good earnest.	999
	How sometimes nature will betray its folly,	999
	Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime	999
	To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines	999
	Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil	999
	Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,	999
	In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,	999
	Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,	999
	As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:	999
	How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,	999
	This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,	999
	Will you take eggs for money?	999
	999
MAMILLIUS	No, my lord, I'll fight.	999
	999
LEONTES	You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,	999
	Are you so fond of your young prince as we	999
	Do seem to be of ours?	999
	999
POLIXENES	If at home, sir,	999
	He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,	999
	Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,	999
	My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:	999
	He makes a July's day short as December,	999
	And with his varying childness cures in me	999
	Thoughts that would thick my blood.	999
	999
LEONTES	So stands this squire	999
	Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,	999
	And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,	999
	How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;	999
	Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:	999
	Next to thyself and my young rover, he's	999
	Apparent to my heart.	999
	999
HERMIONE	If you would seek us,	999
	We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?	999
	999
LEONTES	To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,	999
	Be you beneath the sky.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
		  I am angling now,	999
	Though you perceive me not how I give line.	999
	Go to, go to!	999
	How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!	999
	And arms her with the boldness of a wife	999
	To her allowing husband!	999
	999
	[Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants]	999
	999
		   Gone already!	999
	Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and	999
	ears a fork'd one!	999
	Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I	999
	Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue	999
	Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour	999
	Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.	999
	There have been,	999
	Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;	999
	And many a man there is, even at this present,	999
	Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,	999
	That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence	999
	And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by	999
	Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't	999
	Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,	999
	As mine, against their will. Should all despair	999
	That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind	999
	Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;	999
	It is a bawdy planet, that will strike	999
	Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,	999
	From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,	999
	No barricado for a belly; know't;	999
	It will let in and out the enemy	999
	With bag and baggage: many thousand on's	999
	Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!	999
	999
MAMILLIUS	I am like you, they say.	999
	999
LEONTES	Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?	999
	999
CAMILLO	Ay, my good lord.	999
	999
LEONTES	Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.	999
	999
	[Exit MAMILLIUS]	999
	999
	Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.	999
	999
CAMILLO	You had much ado to make his anchor hold:	999
	When you cast out, it still came home.	999
	999
LEONTES	Didst note it?	999
	999
CAMILLO	He would not stay at your petitions: made	999
	His business more material.	999
	999
LEONTES	Didst perceive it?	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	They're here with me already, whispering, rounding	999
	'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,	999
	When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,	999
	That he did stay?	999
	999
CAMILLO	                  At the good queen's entreaty.	999
	999
LEONTES	At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent	999
	But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken	999
	By any understanding pate but thine?	999
	For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in	999
	More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,	999
	But of the finer natures? by some severals	999
	Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes	999
	Perchance are to this business purblind? say.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Business, my lord! I think most understand	999
	Bohemia stays here longer.	999
	999
LEONTES	Ha!	999
	999
CAMILLO	Stays here longer.	999
	999
LEONTES	Ay, but why?	999
	999
CAMILLO	To satisfy your highness and the entreaties	999
	Of our most gracious mistress.	999
	999
LEONTES	Satisfy!	999
	The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!	999
	Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,	999
	With all the nearest things to my heart, as well	999
	My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou	999
	Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed	999
	Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been	999
	Deceived in thy integrity, deceived	999
	In that which seems so.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Be it forbid, my lord!	999
	999
LEONTES	To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,	999
	If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,	999
	Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining	999
	From course required; or else thou must be counted	999
	A servant grafted in my serious trust	999
	And therein negligent; or else a fool	999
	That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,	999
	And takest it all for jest.	999
	999
CAMILLO	My gracious lord,	999
	I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;	999
	In every one of these no man is free,	999
	But that his negligence, his folly, fear,	999
	Among the infinite doings of the world,	999
	Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,	999
	If ever I were wilful-negligent,	999
	It was my folly; if industriously	999
	I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,	999
	Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful	999
	To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,	999
	Where of the execution did cry out	999
	Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear	999
	Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,	999
	Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty	999
	Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,	999
	Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass	999
	By its own visage: if I then deny it,	999
	'Tis none of mine.	999
	999
LEONTES	                  Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--	999
	But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass	999
	Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--	999
	For to a vision so apparent rumour	999
	Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation	999
	Resides not in that man that does not think,--	999
	My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,	999
	Or else be impudently negative,	999
	To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say	999
	My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name	999
	As rank as any flax-wench that puts to	999
	Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.	999
	999
CAMILLO	I would not be a stander-by to hear	999
	My sovereign mistress clouded so, without	999
	My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,	999
	You never spoke what did become you less	999
	Than this; which to reiterate were sin	999
	As deep as that, though true.	999
	999
LEONTES	Is whispering nothing?	999
	Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?	999
	Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career	999
	Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible	999
	Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?	999
	Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?	999
	Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes	999
	Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,	999
	That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?	999
	Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;	999
	The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;	999
	My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,	999
	If this be nothing.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Good my lord, be cured	999
	Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;	999
	For 'tis most dangerous.	999
	999
LEONTES	Say it be, 'tis true.	999
	999
CAMILLO	No, no, my lord.	999
	999
LEONTES	                  It is; you lie, you lie:	999
	I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,	999
	Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,	999
	Or else a hovering temporizer, that	999
	Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,	999
	Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver	999
	Infected as her life, she would not live	999
	The running of one glass.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Who does infect her?	999
	999
LEONTES	Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging	999
	About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I	999
	Had servants true about me, that bare eyes	999
	To see alike mine honour as their profits,	999
	Their own particular thrifts, they would do that	999
	Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,	999
	His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form	999
	Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see	999
	Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,	999
	How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,	999
	To give mine enemy a lasting wink;	999
	Which draught to me were cordial.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Sir, my lord,	999
	I could do this, and that with no rash potion,	999
	But with a lingering dram that should not work	999
	Maliciously like poison: but I cannot	999
	Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,	999
	So sovereignly being honourable.	999
	I have loved thee,--	999
	999
LEONTES	Make that thy question, and go rot!	999
	Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,	999
	To appoint myself in this vexation, sully	999
	The purity and whiteness of my sheets,	999
	Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted	999
	Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,	999
	Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,	999
	Who I do think is mine and love as mine,	999
	Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?	999
	Could man so blench?	999
	999
CAMILLO	I must believe you, sir:	999
	I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;	999
	Provided that, when he's removed, your highness	999
	Will take again your queen as yours at first,	999
	Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing	999
	The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms	999
	Known and allied to yours.	999
	999
LEONTES	Thou dost advise me	999
	Even so as I mine own course have set down:	999
	I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.	999
	999
CAMILLO	My lord,	999
	Go then; and with a countenance as clear	999
	As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia	999
	And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:	999
	If from me he have wholesome beverage,	999
	Account me not your servant.	999
	999
LEONTES	This is all:	999
	Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;	999
	Do't not, thou split'st thine own.	999
	999
CAMILLO	I'll do't, my lord.	999
	999
LEONTES	I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CAMILLO	O miserable lady! But, for me,	999
	What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner	999
	Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't	999
	Is the obedience to a master, one	999
	Who in rebellion with himself will have	999
	All that are his so too. To do this deed,	999
	Promotion follows. If I could find example	999
	Of thousands that had struck anointed kings	999
	And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since	999
	Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,	999
	Let villany itself forswear't. I must	999
	Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain	999
	To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!	999
	Here comes Bohemia.	999
	999
	[Re-enter POLIXENES]	999
	999
POLIXENES	This is strange: methinks	999
	My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?	999
	Good day, Camillo.	999
	999
CAMILLO	                  Hail, most royal sir!	999
	999
POLIXENES	What is the news i' the court?	999
	999
CAMILLO	None rare, my lord.	999
	999
POLIXENES	The king hath on him such a countenance	999
	As he had lost some province and a region	999
	Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him	999
	With customary compliment; when he,	999
	Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling	999
	A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and	999
	So leaves me to consider what is breeding	999
	That changeth thus his manners.	999
	999
CAMILLO	I dare not know, my lord.	999
	999
POLIXENES	How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?	999
	Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;	999
	For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.	999
	And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,	999
	Your changed complexions are to me a mirror	999
	Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be	999
	A party in this alteration, finding	999
	Myself thus alter'd with 't.	999
	999
CAMILLO	There is a sickness	999
	Which puts some of us in distemper, but	999
	I cannot name the disease; and it is caught	999
	Of you that yet are well.	999
	999
POLIXENES	How! caught of me!	999
	Make me not sighted like the basilisk:	999
	I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better	999
	By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--	999
	As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto	999
	Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns	999
	Our gentry than our parents' noble names,	999
	In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,	999
	If you know aught which does behove my knowledge	999
	Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not	999
	In ignorant concealment.	999
	999
CAMILLO	I may not answer.	999
	999
POLIXENES	A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!	999
	I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,	999
	I conjure thee, by all the parts of man	999
	Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least	999
	Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare	999
	What incidency thou dost guess of harm	999
	Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;	999
	Which way to be prevented, if to be;	999
	If not, how best to bear it.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Sir, I will tell you;	999
	Since I am charged in honour and by him	999
	That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,	999
	Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as	999
	I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me	999
	Cry lost, and so good night!	999
	999
POLIXENES	On, good Camillo.	999
	999
CAMILLO	I am appointed him to murder you.	999
	999
POLIXENES	By whom, Camillo?	999
	999
CAMILLO	                        By the king.	999
	999
POLIXENES	For what?	999
	999
CAMILLO	He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,	999
	As he had seen't or been an instrument	999
	To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen	999
	Forbiddenly.	999
	999
POLIXENES	                  O, then my best blood turn	999
	To an infected jelly and my name	999
	Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!	999
	Turn then my freshest reputation to	999
	A savour that may strike the dullest nostril	999
	Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,	999
	Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection	999
	That e'er was heard or read!	999
	999
CAMILLO	Swear his thought over	999
	By each particular star in heaven and	999
	By all their influences, you may as well	999
	Forbid the sea for to obey the moon	999
	As or by oath remove or counsel shake	999
	The fabric of his folly, whose foundation	999
	Is piled upon his faith and will continue	999
	The standing of his body.	999
	999
POLIXENES	How should this grow?	999
	999
CAMILLO	I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to	999
	Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.	999
	If therefore you dare trust my honesty,	999
	That lies enclosed in this trunk which you	999
	Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!	999
	Your followers I will whisper to the business,	999
	And will by twos and threes at several posterns	999
	Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put	999
	My fortunes to your service, which are here	999
	By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;	999
	For, by the honour of my parents, I	999
	Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,	999
	I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer	999
	Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon	999
	His execution sworn.	999
	999
POLIXENES	I do believe thee:	999
	I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:	999
	Be pilot to me and thy places shall	999
	Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and	999
	My people did expect my hence departure	999
	Two days ago. This jealousy	999
	Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,	999
	Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,	999
	Must it be violent, and as he does conceive	999
	He is dishonour'd by a man which ever	999
	Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must	999
	In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:	999
	Good expedition be my friend, and comfort	999
	The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing	999
	Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;	999
	I will respect thee as a father if	999
	Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.	999
	999
CAMILLO	It is in mine authority to command	999
	The keys of all the posterns: please your highness	999
	To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

	THE WINTER'S TALE	999
	999
	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A room in LEONTES' palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies]	999
	999
HERMIONE	Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,	999
	'Tis past enduring.	999
	999
First Lady	Come, my gracious lord,	999
	Shall I be your playfellow?	999
	999
MAMILLIUS	No, I'll none of you.	999
	999
First Lady	Why, my sweet lord?	999
	999
MAMILLIUS	You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if	999
	I were a baby still. I love you better.	999
	999
Second Lady	And why so, my lord?	999
	999
MAMILLIUS	Not for because	999
	Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,	999
	Become some women best, so that there be not	999
	Too much hair there, but in a semicircle	999
	Or a half-moon made with a pen.	999
	999
Second Lady	Who taught you this?	999
	999
MAMILLIUS	I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now	999
	What colour are your eyebrows?	999
	999
First Lady	Blue, my lord.	999
	999
MAMILLIUS	Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose	999
	That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.	999
	999
First Lady	Hark ye;	999
	The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall	999
	Present our services to a fine new prince	999
	One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,	999
	If we would have you.	999
	999
Second Lady	She is spread of late	999
	Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!	999
	999
HERMIONE	What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now	999
	I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,	999
	And tell 's a tale.	999
	999
MAMILLIUS	Merry or sad shall't be?	999
	999
HERMIONE	As merry as you will.	999
	999
MAMILLIUS	A sad tale's best for winter: I have one	999
	Of sprites and goblins.	999
	999
HERMIONE	Let's have that, good sir.	999
	Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best	999
	To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.	999
	999
MAMILLIUS	There was a man--	999
	999
HERMIONE	                  Nay, come, sit down; then on.	999
	999
MAMILLIUS	Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;	999
	Yond crickets shall not hear it.	999
	999
HERMIONE	Come on, then,	999
	And give't me in mine ear.	999
	999
	[Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others]	999
	999
LEONTES	Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?	999
	999
First Lord	Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never	999
	Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them	999
	Even to their ships.	999
	999
LEONTES	How blest am I	999
	In my just censure, in my true opinion!	999
	Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed	999
	In being so blest! There may be in the cup	999
	A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,	999
	And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge	999
	Is not infected: but if one present	999
	The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known	999
	How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,	999
	With violent hefts. I have drunk,	999
	and seen the spider.	999
	Camillo was his help in this, his pander:	999
	There is a plot against my life, my crown;	999
	All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain	999
	Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:	999
	He has discover'd my design, and I	999
	Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick	999
	For them to play at will. How came the posterns	999
	So easily open?	999
	999
First Lord	                  By his great authority;	999
	Which often hath no less prevail'd than so	999
	On your command.	999
	999
LEONTES	                          I know't too well.	999
	Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:	999
	Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you	999
	Have too much blood in him.	999
	999
HERMIONE	What is this? sport?	999
	999
LEONTES	Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;	999
	Away with him! and let her sport herself	999
	With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes	999
	Has made thee swell thus.	999
	999
HERMIONE	But I'ld say he had not,	999
	And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,	999
	Howe'er you lean to the nayward.	999
	999
LEONTES	You, my lords,	999
	Look on her, mark her well; be but about	999
	To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and	999
	The justice of your bearts will thereto add	999
	'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'	999
	Praise her but for this her without-door form,	999
	Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight	999
	The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands	999
	That calumny doth use--O, I am out--	999
	That mercy does, for calumny will sear	999
	Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,	999
	When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between	999
	Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,	999
	From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,	999
	She's an adulteress.	999
	999
HERMIONE	Should a villain say so,	999
	The most replenish'd villain in the world,	999
	He were as much more villain: you, my lord,	999
	Do but mistake.	999
	999
LEONTES	                  You have mistook, my lady,	999
	Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!	999
	Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,	999
	Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,	999
	Should a like language use to all degrees	999
	And mannerly distinguishment leave out	999
	Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said	999
	She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:	999
	More, she's a traitor and Camillo is	999
	A federary with her, and one that knows	999
	What she should shame to know herself	999
	But with her most vile principal, that she's	999
	A bed-swerver, even as bad as those	999
	That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy	999
	To this their late escape.	999
	999
HERMIONE	No, by my life.	999
	Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,	999
	When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that	999
	You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,	999
	You scarce can right me throughly then to say	999
	You did mistake.	999
	999
LEONTES	                  No; if I mistake	999
	In those foundations which I build upon,	999
	The centre is not big enough to bear	999
	A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!	999
	He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty	999
	But that he speaks.	999
	999
HERMIONE	There's some ill planet reigns:	999
	I must be patient till the heavens look	999
	With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,	999
	I am not prone to weeping, as our sex	999
	Commonly are; the want of which vain dew	999
	Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have	999
	That honourable grief lodged here which burns	999
	Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,	999
	With thoughts so qualified as your charities	999
	Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so	999
	The king's will be perform'd!	999
	999
LEONTES	Shall I be heard?	999
	999
HERMIONE	Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,	999
	My women may be with me; for you see	999
	My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;	999
	There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress	999
	Has deserved prison, then abound in tears	999
	As I come out: this action I now go on	999
	Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:	999
	I never wish'd to see you sorry; now	999
	I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.	999
	999
LEONTES	Go, do our bidding; hence!	999
	999
	[Exit HERMIONE, guarded; with Ladies]	999
	999
First Lord	Beseech your highness, call the queen again.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice	999
	Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,	999
	Yourself, your queen, your son.	999
	999
First Lord	For her, my lord,	999
	I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,	999
	Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless	999
	I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,	999
	In this which you accuse her.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	If it prove	999
	She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where	999
	I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;	999
	Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;	999
	For every inch of woman in the world,	999
	Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.	999
	999
LEONTES	         Hold your peaces.	999
	999
First Lord	Good my lord,--	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:	999
	You are abused and by some putter-on	999
	That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,	999
	I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,	999
	I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven	999
	The second and the third, nine, and some five;	999
	If this prove true, they'll pay for't:	999
	by mine honour,	999
	I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,	999
	To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;	999
	And I had rather glib myself than they	999
	Should not produce fair issue.	999
	999
LEONTES	Cease; no more.	999
	You smell this business with a sense as cold	999
	As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't	999
	As you feel doing thus; and see withal	999
	The instruments that feel.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	If it be so,	999
	We need no grave to bury honesty:	999
	There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten	999
	Of the whole dungy earth.	999
	999
LEONTES	What! lack I credit?	999
	999
First Lord	I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,	999
	Upon this ground; and more it would content me	999
	To have her honour true than your suspicion,	999
	Be blamed for't how you might.	999
	999
LEONTES	Why, what need we	999
	Commune with you of this, but rather follow	999
	Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative	999
	Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness	999
	Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied	999
	Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not	999
	Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves	999
	We need no more of your advice: the matter,	999
	The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all	999
	Properly ours.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	                  And I wish, my liege,	999
	You had only in your silent judgment tried it,	999
	Without more overture.	999
	999
LEONTES	How could that be?	999
	Either thou art most ignorant by age,	999
	Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,	999
	Added to their familiarity,	999
	Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,	999
	That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation	999
	But only seeing, all other circumstances	999
	Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:	999
	Yet, for a greater confirmation,	999
	For in an act of this importance 'twere	999
	Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post	999
	To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,	999
	Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know	999
	Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle	999
	They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,	999
	Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?	999
	999
First Lord	Well done, my lord.	999
	999
LEONTES	Though I am satisfied and need no more	999
	Than what I know, yet shall the oracle	999
	Give rest to the minds of others, such as he	999
	Whose ignorant credulity will not	999
	Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good	999
	From our free person she should be confined,	999
	Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence	999
	Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;	999
	We are to speak in public; for this business	999
	Will raise us all.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	[Aside]	999
	999
	To laughter, as I take it,	999
	If the good truth were known.	999
	999

	THE WINTER'S TALE	999
	999
	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	A prison.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PAULINA, a Gentleman, and Attendants]	999
	999
PAULINA	The keeper of the prison, call to him;	999
	let him have knowledge who I am.	999
	999
	[Exit Gentleman]	999
	999
		               Good lady,	999
	No court in Europe is too good for thee;	999
	What dost thou then in prison?	999
	999
	[Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler]	999
	999
		         Now, good sir,	999
	You know me, do you not?	999
	999
Gaoler	For a worthy lady	999
	And one whom much I honour.	999
	999
PAULINA	Pray you then,	999
	Conduct me to the queen.	999
	999
Gaoler	I may not, madam:	999
	To the contrary I have express commandment.	999
	999
PAULINA	Here's ado,	999
	To lock up honesty and honour from	999
	The access of gentle visitors!	999
	Is't lawful, pray you,	999
	To see her women? any of them? Emilia?	999
	999
Gaoler	So please you, madam,	999
	To put apart these your attendants, I	999
	Shall bring Emilia forth.	999
	999
PAULINA	I pray now, call her.	999
	Withdraw yourselves.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants]	999
	999
Gaoler	And, madam,	999
	I must be present at your conference.	999
	999
PAULINA	Well, be't so, prithee.	999
	999
	[Exit Gaoler]	999
	999
	Here's such ado to make no stain a stain	999
	As passes colouring.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA]	999
	999
	Dear gentlewoman,	999
	How fares our gracious lady?	999
	999
EMILIA	As well as one so great and so forlorn	999
	May hold together: on her frights and griefs,	999
	Which never tender lady hath born greater,	999
	She is something before her time deliver'd.	999
	999
PAULINA	A boy?	999
	999
EMILIA	     A daughter, and a goodly babe,	999
	Lusty and like to live: the queen receives	999
	Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,	999
	I am innocent as you.'	999
	999
PAULINA	I dare be sworn	999
	These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,	999
	beshrew them!	999
	He must be told on't, and he shall: the office	999
	Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:	999
	If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister	999
	And never to my red-look'd anger be	999
	The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,	999
	Commend my best obedience to the queen:	999
	If she dares trust me with her little babe,	999
	I'll show't the king and undertake to be	999
	Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know	999
	How he may soften at the sight o' the child:	999
	The silence often of pure innocence	999
	Persuades when speaking fails.	999
	999
EMILIA	Most worthy madam,	999
	Your honour and your goodness is so evident	999
	That your free undertaking cannot miss	999
	A thriving issue: there is no lady living	999
	So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship	999
	To visit the next room, I'll presently	999
	Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;	999
	Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,	999
	But durst not tempt a minister of honour,	999
	Lest she should be denied.	999
	999
PAULINA	Tell her, Emilia.	999
	I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't	999
	As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted	999
	I shall do good.	999
	999
EMILIA	                  Now be you blest for it!	999
	I'll to the queen: please you,	999
	come something nearer.	999
	999
Gaoler	Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,	999
	I know not what I shall incur to pass it,	999
	Having no warrant.	999
	999
PAULINA	                  You need not fear it, sir:	999
	This child was prisoner to the womb and is	999
	By law and process of great nature thence	999
	Freed and enfranchised, not a party to	999
	The anger of the king nor guilty of,	999
	If any be, the trespass of the queen.	999
	999
Gaoler	I do believe it.	999
	999
PAULINA	                  Do not you fear: upon mine honour,	999
	I will stand betwixt you and danger.	999
	999

	THE WINTER'S TALE	999
	999
	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	A room in LEONTES' palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants]	999
	999
LEONTES	Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness	999
	To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If	999
	The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,	999
	She the adulteress; for the harlot king	999
	Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank	999
	And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she	999
	I can hook to me: say that she were gone,	999
	Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest	999
	Might come to me again. Who's there?	999
	999
First Servant	My lord?	999
	999
LEONTES	How does the boy?	999
	999
First Servant	                  He took good rest to-night;	999
	'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.	999
	999
LEONTES	To see his nobleness!	999
	Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,	999
	He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,	999
	Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,	999
	Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,	999
	And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,	999
	See how he fares.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant]	999
	999
	Fie, fie! no thought of him:	999
	The thought of my revenges that way	999
	Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,	999
	And in his parties, his alliance; let him be	999
	Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,	999
	Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes	999
	Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:	999
	They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor	999
	Shall she within my power.	999
	999
	[Enter PAULINA, with a child]	999
	999
First Lord	You must not enter.	999
	999
PAULINA	Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:	999
	Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,	999
	Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,	999
	More free than he is jealous.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	That's enough.	999
	999
Second Servant	Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded	999
	None should come at him.	999
	999
PAULINA	Not so hot, good sir:	999
	I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,	999
	That creep like shadows by him and do sigh	999
	At each his needless heavings, such as you	999
	Nourish the cause of his awaking: I	999
	Do come with words as medicinal as true,	999
	Honest as either, to purge him of that humour	999
	That presses him from sleep.	999
	999
LEONTES	What noise there, ho?	999
	999
PAULINA	No noise, my lord; but needful conference	999
	About some gossips for your highness.	999
	999
LEONTES	How!	999
	Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,	999
	I charged thee that she should not come about me:	999
	I knew she would.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	                  I told her so, my lord,	999
	On your displeasure's peril and on mine,	999
	She should not visit you.	999
	999
LEONTES	What, canst not rule her?	999
	999
PAULINA	From all dishonesty he can: in this,	999
	Unless he take the course that you have done,	999
	Commit me for committing honour, trust it,	999
	He shall not rule me.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	La you now, you hear:	999
	When she will take the rein I let her run;	999
	But she'll not stumble.	999
	999
PAULINA	Good my liege, I come;	999
	And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess	999
	Myself your loyal servant, your physician,	999
	Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare	999
	Less appear so in comforting your evils,	999
	Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come	999
	From your good queen.	999
	999
LEONTES	Good queen!	999
	999
PAULINA	Good queen, my lord,	999
	Good queen; I say good queen;	999
	And would by combat make her good, so were I	999
	A man, the worst about you.	999
	999
LEONTES	Force her hence.	999
	999
PAULINA	Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes	999
	First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;	999
	But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,	999
	For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;	999
	Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.	999
	999
	[Laying down the child]	999
	999
LEONTES	Out!	999
	A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:	999
	A most intelligencing bawd!	999
	999
PAULINA	Not so:	999
	I am as ignorant in that as you	999
	In so entitling me, and no less honest	999
	Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,	999
	As this world goes, to pass for honest.	999
	999
LEONTES	Traitors!	999
	Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.	999
	Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted	999
	By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;	999
	Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.	999
	999
PAULINA	For ever	999
	Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou	999
	Takest up the princess by that forced baseness	999
	Which he has put upon't!	999
	999
LEONTES	He dreads his wife.	999
	999
PAULINA	So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt	999
	You'ld call your children yours.	999
	999
LEONTES	A nest of traitors!	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	I am none, by this good light.	999
	999
PAULINA	Nor I, nor any	999
	But one that's here, and that's himself, for he	999
	The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,	999
	His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,	999
	Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;	999
	and will not--	999
	For, as the case now stands, it is a curse	999
	He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove	999
	The root of his opinion, which is rotten	999
	As ever oak or stone was sound.	999
	999
LEONTES	A callat	999
	Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband	999
	And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;	999
	It is the issue of Polixenes:	999
	Hence with it, and together with the dam	999
	Commit them to the fire!	999
	999
PAULINA	It is yours;	999
	And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,	999
	So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,	999
	Although the print be little, the whole matter	999
	And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,	999
	The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,	999
	The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,	999
	His smiles,	999
	The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:	999
	And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it	999
	So like to him that got it, if thou hast	999
	The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours	999
	No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,	999
	Her children not her husband's!	999
	999
LEONTES	A gross hag	999
	And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,	999
	That wilt not stay her tongue.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	Hang all the husbands	999
	That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself	999
	Hardly one subject.	999
	999
LEONTES	Once more, take her hence.	999
	999
PAULINA	A most unworthy and unnatural lord	999
	Can do no more.	999
	999
LEONTES	                  I'll ha' thee burnt.	999
	999
PAULINA	I care not:	999
	It is an heretic that makes the fire,	999
	Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;	999
	But this most cruel usage of your queen,	999
	Not able to produce more accusation	999
	Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours	999
	Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,	999
	Yea, scandalous to the world.	999
	999
LEONTES	On your allegiance,	999
	Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,	999
	Where were her life? she durst not call me so,	999
	If she did know me one. Away with her!	999
	999
PAULINA	I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.	999
	Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:	999
	Jove send her	999
	A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?	999
	You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,	999
	Will never do him good, not one of you.	999
	So, so: farewell; we are gone.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LEONTES	Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.	999
	My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast	999
	A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence	999
	And see it instantly consumed with fire;	999
	Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:	999
	Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,	999
	And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,	999
	With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse	999
	And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;	999
	The bastard brains with these my proper hands	999
	Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;	999
	For thou set'st on thy wife.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	I did not, sir:	999
	These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,	999
	Can clear me in't.	999
	999
Lords	                  We can: my royal liege,	999
	He is not guilty of her coming hither.	999
	999
LEONTES	You're liars all.	999
	999
First Lord	Beseech your highness, give us better credit:	999
	We have always truly served you, and beseech you	999
	So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,	999
	As recompense of our dear services	999
	Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,	999
	Which being so horrible, so bloody, must	999
	Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.	999
	999
LEONTES	I am a feather for each wind that blows:	999
	Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel	999
	And call me father? better burn it now	999
	Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.	999
	It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;	999
	You that have been so tenderly officious	999
	With Lady Margery, your midwife there,	999
	To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,	999
	So sure as this beard's grey,	999
	--what will you adventure	999
	To save this brat's life?	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	Any thing, my lord,	999
	That my ability may undergo	999
	And nobleness impose: at least thus much:	999
	I'll pawn the little blood which I have left	999
	To save the innocent: any thing possible.	999
	999
LEONTES	It shall be possible. Swear by this sword	999
	Thou wilt perform my bidding.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	I will, my lord.	999
	999
LEONTES	Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail	999
	Of any point in't shall not only be	999
	Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,	999
	Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,	999
	As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry	999
	This female bastard hence and that thou bear it	999
	To some remote and desert place quite out	999
	Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,	999
	Without more mercy, to its own protection	999
	And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune	999
	It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,	999
	On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,	999
	That thou commend it strangely to some place	999
	Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	I swear to do this, though a present death	999
	Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:	999
	Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens	999
	To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say	999
	Casting their savageness aside have done	999
	Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous	999
	In more than this deed does require! And blessing	999
	Against this cruelty fight on thy side,	999
	Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!	999
	999
	[Exit with the child]	999
	999
LEONTES	No, I'll not rear	999
	Another's issue.	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
Servant	                  Please your highness, posts	999
	From those you sent to the oracle are come	999
	An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,	999
	Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,	999
	Hasting to the court.	999
	999
First Lord	So please you, sir, their speed	999
	Hath been beyond account.	999
	999
LEONTES	Twenty-three days	999
	They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells	999
	The great Apollo suddenly will have	999
	The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;	999
	Summon a session, that we may arraign	999
	Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath	999
	Been publicly accused, so shall she have	999
	A just and open trial. While she lives	999
	My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,	999
	And think upon my bidding.	999

SCENE I	A sea-port in Sicilia.	999
	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CLEOMENES and DION]	999
	999
CLEOMENES	The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,	999
	Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing	999
	The common praise it bears.	999
	999
DION	I shall report,	999
	For most it caught me, the celestial habits,	999
	Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence	999
	Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!	999
	How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly	999
	It was i' the offering!	999
	999
CLEOMENES	But of all, the burst	999
	And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,	999
	Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.	999
	That I was nothing.	999
	999
DION	If the event o' the journey	999
	Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--	999
	As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,	999
	The time is worth the use on't.	999
	999
CLEOMENES	Great Apollo	999
	Turn all to the best! These proclamations,	999
	So forcing faults upon Hermione,	999
	I little like.	999
	999
DION	                  The violent carriage of it	999
	Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,	999
	Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,	999
	Shall the contents discover, something rare	999
	Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!	999

	999
SCENE II	A court of Justice.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LEONTES, Lords, and Officers]	999
	999
LEONTES	This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,	999
	Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried	999
	The daughter of a king, our wife, and one	999
	Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd	999
	Of being tyrannous, since we so openly	999
	Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,	999
	Even to the guilt or the purgation.	999
	Produce the prisoner.	999
	999
Officer	It is his highness' pleasure that the queen	999
	Appear in person here in court. Silence!	999
	999
	[Enter HERMIONE guarded;	999
	PAULINA and Ladies attending]	999
	999
LEONTES	Read the indictment.	999
	999
Officer	[Reads]            Hermione, queen to the worthy	999
	Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and	999
	arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery	999
	with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring	999
	with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign	999
	lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence	999
	whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,	999
	thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance	999
	of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for	999
	their better safety, to fly away by night.	999
	999
HERMIONE	Since what I am to say must be but that	999
	Which contradicts my accusation and	999
	The testimony on my part no other	999
	But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me	999
	To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity	999
	Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,	999
	Be so received. But thus: if powers divine	999
	Behold our human actions, as they do,	999
	I doubt not then but innocence shall make	999
	False accusation blush and tyranny	999
	Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,	999
	Who least will seem to do so, my past life	999
	Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,	999
	As I am now unhappy; which is more	999
	Than history can pattern, though devised	999
	And play'd to take spectators. For behold me	999
	A fellow of the royal bed, which owe	999
	A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,	999
	The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing	999
	To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore	999
	Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it	999
	As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,	999
	'Tis a derivative from me to mine,	999
	And only that I stand for. I appeal	999
	To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes	999
	Came to your court, how I was in your grace,	999
	How merited to be so; since he came,	999
	With what encounter so uncurrent I	999
	Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond	999
	The bound of honour, or in act or will	999
	That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts	999
	Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin	999
	Cry fie upon my grave!	999
	999
LEONTES	I ne'er heard yet	999
	That any of these bolder vices wanted	999
	Less impudence to gainsay what they did	999
	Than to perform it first.	999
	999
HERMIONE	That's true enough;	999
	Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.	999
	999
LEONTES	You will not own it.	999
	999
HERMIONE	More than mistress of	999
	Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not	999
	At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,	999
	With whom I am accused, I do confess	999
	I loved him as in honour he required,	999
	With such a kind of love as might become	999
	A lady like me, with a love even such,	999
	So and no other, as yourself commanded:	999
	Which not to have done I think had been in me	999
	Both disobedience and ingratitude	999
	To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,	999
	Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely	999
	That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,	999
	I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd	999
	For me to try how: all I know of it	999
	Is that Camillo was an honest man;	999
	And why he left your court, the gods themselves,	999
	Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.	999
	999
LEONTES	You knew of his departure, as you know	999
	What you have underta'en to do in's absence.	999
	999
HERMIONE	Sir,	999
	You speak a language that I understand not:	999
	My life stands in the level of your dreams,	999
	Which I'll lay down.	999
	999
LEONTES	Your actions are my dreams;	999
	You had a bastard by Polixenes,	999
	And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--	999
	Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:	999
	Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as	999
	Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,	999
	No father owning it,--which is, indeed,	999
	More criminal in thee than it,--so thou	999
	Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage	999
	Look for no less than death.	999
	999
HERMIONE	Sir, spare your threats:	999
	The bug which you would fright me with I seek.	999
	To me can life be no commodity:	999
	The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,	999
	I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,	999
	But know not how it went. My second joy	999
	And first-fruits of my body, from his presence	999
	I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort	999
	Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,	999
	The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,	999
	Haled out to murder: myself on every post	999
	Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred	999
	The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs	999
	To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried	999
	Here to this place, i' the open air, before	999
	I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,	999
	Tell me what blessings I have here alive,	999
	That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.	999
	But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,	999
	I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,	999
	Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd	999
	Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else	999
	But what your jealousies awake, I tell you	999
	'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,	999
	I do refer me to the oracle:	999
	Apollo be my judge!	999
	999
First Lord	This your request	999
	Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,	999
	And in Apollos name, his oracle.	999
	999
	[Exeunt certain Officers]	999
	999
HERMIONE	The Emperor of Russia was my father:	999
	O that he were alive, and here beholding	999
	His daughter's trial! that he did but see	999
	The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes	999
	Of pity, not revenge!	999
	999
	[Re-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DION]	999
	999
Officer	You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,	999
	That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have	999
	Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought	999
	The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd	999
	Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,	999
	You have not dared to break the holy seal	999
	Nor read the secrets in't.	999
	999
	999
CLEOMENES	|	999
	|	All this we swear.	999
DION	|	999
	999
	999
LEONTES	Break up the seals and read.	999
	999
Officer	[Reads]	Hermione is chaste;	999
	Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes	999
	a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;	999
	and the king shall live without an heir, if that	999
	which is lost be not found.	999
	999
Lords	Now blessed be the great Apollo!	999
	999
HERMIONE	Praised!	999
	999
LEONTES	Hast thou read truth?	999
	999
Officer	Ay, my lord; even so	999
	As it is here set down.	999
	999
LEONTES	There is no truth at all i' the oracle:	999
	The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.	999
	999
	[Enter Servant]	999
	999
Servant	My lord the king, the king!	999
	999
LEONTES	What is the business?	999
	999
Servant	O sir, I shall be hated to report it!	999
	The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear	999
	Of the queen's speed, is gone.	999
	999
LEONTES	How! gone!	999
	999
Servant	Is dead.	999
	999
LEONTES	Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves	999
	Do strike at my injustice.	999
	999
	[HERMIONE swoons]	999
	999
		     How now there!	999
	999
PAULINA	This news is mortal to the queen: look down	999
	And see what death is doing.	999
	999
LEONTES	Take her hence:	999
	Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:	999
	I have too much believed mine own suspicion:	999
	Beseech you, tenderly apply to her	999
	Some remedies for life.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies, with HERMIONE]	999
	999
		  Apollo, pardon	999
	My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!	999
	I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,	999
	New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,	999
	Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;	999
	For, being transported by my jealousies	999
	To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose	999
	Camillo for the minister to poison	999
	My friend Polixenes: which had been done,	999
	But that the good mind of Camillo tardied	999
	My swift command, though I with death and with	999
	Reward did threaten and encourage him,	999
	Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane	999
	And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest	999
	Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,	999
	Which you knew great, and to the hazard	999
	Of all encertainties himself commended,	999
	No richer than his honour: how he glisters	999
	Thorough my rust! and how his pity	999
	Does my deeds make the blacker!	999
	999
	[Re-enter PAULINA]	999
	999
PAULINA	Woe the while!	999
	O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,	999
	Break too.	999
	999
First Lord	          What fit is this, good lady?	999
	999
PAULINA	What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?	999
	What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?	999
	In leads or oils? what old or newer torture	999
	Must I receive, whose every word deserves	999
	To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny	999
	Together working with thy jealousies,	999
	Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle	999
	For girls of nine, O, think what they have done	999
	And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all	999
	Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.	999
	That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;	999
	That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant	999
	And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,	999
	Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,	999
	To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,	999
	More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon	999
	The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter	999
	To be or none or little; though a devil	999
	Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:	999
	Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death	999
	Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,	999
	Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart	999
	That could conceive a gross and foolish sire	999
	Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,	999
	Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,	999
	When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,	999
	The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,	999
	and vengeance for't	999
	Not dropp'd down yet.	999
	999
First Lord	The higher powers forbid!	999
	999
PAULINA	I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath	999
	Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring	999
	Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,	999
	Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you	999
	As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!	999
	Do not repent these things, for they are heavier	999
	Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee	999
	To nothing but despair. A thousand knees	999
	Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,	999
	Upon a barren mountain and still winter	999
	In storm perpetual, could not move the gods	999
	To look that way thou wert.	999
	999
LEONTES	Go on, go on	999
	Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved	999
	All tongues to talk their bitterest.	999
	999
First Lord	Say no more:	999
	Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault	999
	I' the boldness of your speech.	999
	999
PAULINA	I am sorry for't:	999
	All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,	999
	I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much	999
	The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd	999
	To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help	999
	Should be past grief: do not receive affliction	999
	At my petition; I beseech you, rather	999
	Let me be punish'd, that have minded you	999
	Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege	999
	Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:	999
	The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--	999
	I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;	999
	I'll not remember you of my own lord,	999
	Who is lost too: take your patience to you,	999
	And I'll say nothing.	999
	999
LEONTES	Thou didst speak but well	999
	When most the truth; which I receive much better	999
	Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me	999
	To the dead bodies of my queen and son:	999
	One grave shall be for both: upon them shall	999
	The causes of their death appear, unto	999
	Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit	999
	The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there	999
	Shall be my recreation: so long as nature	999
	Will bear up with this exercise, so long	999
	I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me	999
	Unto these sorrows.	999

ACT III	999

	999
	999
SCENE III	Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child, and a Mariner]	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon	999
	The deserts of Bohemia?	999
	999
Mariner	Ay, my lord: and fear	999
	We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly	999
	And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,	999
	The heavens with that we have in hand are angry	999
	And frown upon 's.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;	999
	Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before	999
	I call upon thee.	999
	999
Mariner	Make your best haste, and go not	999
	Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;	999
	Besides, this place is famous for the creatures	999
	Of prey that keep upon't.	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	Go thou away:	999
	I'll follow instantly.	999
	999
Mariner	I am glad at heart	999
	To be so rid o' the business.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ANTIGONUS	Come, poor babe:	999
	I have heard, but not believed,	999
	the spirits o' the dead	999
	May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother	999
	Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream	999
	So like a waking. To me comes a creature,	999
	Sometimes her head on one side, some another;	999
	I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,	999
	So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,	999
	Like very sanctity, she did approach	999
	My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,	999
	And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes	999
	Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon	999
	Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,	999
	Since fate, against thy better disposition,	999
	Hath made thy person for the thrower-out	999
	Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,	999
	Places remote enough are in Bohemia,	999
	There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe	999
	Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,	999
	I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business	999
	Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see	999
	Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks	999
	She melted into air. Affrighted much,	999
	I did in time collect myself and thought	999
	This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:	999
	Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,	999
	I will be squared by this. I do believe	999
	Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that	999
	Apollo would, this being indeed the issue	999
	Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,	999
	Either for life or death, upon the earth	999
	Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!	999
	There lie, and there thy character: there these;	999
	Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,	999
	And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,	999
	That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed	999
	To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,	999
	But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I	999
	To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!	999
	The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have	999
	A lullaby too rough: I never saw	999
	The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!	999
	Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:	999
	I am gone for ever.	999
	999
	[Exit, pursued by a bear]	999
	999
	[Enter a Shepherd]	999
	999
Shepherd	I would there were no age between sixteen and	999
	three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the	999
	rest; for there is nothing in the between but	999
	getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,	999
	stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but	999
	these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty	999
	hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my	999
	best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find	999
	than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by	999
	the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy	999
	will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very	999
	pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A	999
	pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:	999
	though I am not bookish, yet I can read	999
	waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been	999
	some stair-work, some trunk-work, some	999
	behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this	999
	than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for	999
	pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed	999
	but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!	999
	999
	[Enter Clown]	999
	999
Clown	Hilloa, loa!	999
	999
Shepherd	What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk	999
	on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What	999
	ailest thou, man?	999
	999
Clown	I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!	999
	but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the	999
	sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust	999
	a bodkin's point.	999
	999
Shepherd	Why, boy, how is it?	999
	999
Clown	I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,	999
	how it takes up the shore! but that's not the	999
	point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!	999
	sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the	999
	ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon	999
	swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a	999
	cork into a hogshead. And then for the	999
	land-service, to see how the bear tore out his	999
	shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said	999
	his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an	999
	end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned	999
	it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the	999
	sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared	999
	and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than	999
	the sea or weather.	999
	999
Shepherd	Name of mercy, when was this, boy?	999
	999
Clown	Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these	999
	sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor	999
	the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it	999
	now.	999
	999
Shepherd	Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!	999
	999
Clown	I would you had been by the ship side, to have	999
	helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.	999
	999
Shepherd	Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,	999
	boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things	999
	dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for	999
	thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's	999
	child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;	999
	open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be	999
	rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:	999
	open't. What's within, boy?	999
	999
Clown	You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth	999
	are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!	999
	999
Shepherd	This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up	999
	with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.	999
	We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires	999
	nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good	999
	boy, the next way home.	999
	999
Clown	Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see	999
	if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much	999
	he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they	999
	are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury	999
	it.	999
	999
Shepherd	That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that	999
	which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the	999
	sight of him.	999
	999
Clown	Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.	999
	999
Shepherd	'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.	999

	[Enter Time, the Chorus]	999
	999
Time	I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror	999
	Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,	999
	Now take upon me, in the name of Time,	999
	To use my wings. Impute it not a crime	999
	To me or my swift passage, that I slide	999
	O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried	999
	Of that wide gap, since it is in my power	999
	To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour	999
	To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass	999
	The same I am, ere ancient'st order was	999
	Or what is now received: I witness to	999
	The times that brought them in; so shall I do	999
	To the freshest things now reigning and make stale	999
	The glistering of this present, as my tale	999
	Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,	999
	I turn my glass and give my scene such growing	999
	As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,	999
	The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving	999
	That he shuts up himself, imagine me,	999
	Gentle spectators, that I now may be	999
	In fair Bohemia, and remember well,	999
	I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel	999
	I now name to you; and with speed so pace	999
	To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace	999
	Equal with wondering: what of her ensues	999
	I list not prophecy; but let Time's news	999
	Be known when 'tis brought forth.	999
	A shepherd's daughter,	999
	And what to her adheres, which follows after,	999
	Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,	999
	If ever you have spent time worse ere now;	999
	If never, yet that Time himself doth say	999
	He wishes earnestly you never may.	999

SCENE II	Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO]	999
	999
POLIXENES	I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:	999
	'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to	999
	grant this.	999
	999
CAMILLO	It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though	999
	I have for the most part been aired abroad, I	999
	desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent	999
	king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling	999
	sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to	999
	think so, which is another spur to my departure.	999
	999
POLIXENES	As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of	999
	thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of	999
	thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to	999
	have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having	999
	made me businesses which none without thee can	999
	sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute	999
	them thyself or take away with thee the very	999
	services thou hast done; which if I have not enough	999
	considered, as too much I cannot, to be more	999
	thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit	999
	therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal	999
	country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very	999
	naming punishes me with the remembrance of that	999
	penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,	999
	my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen	999
	and children are even now to be afresh lamented.	999
	Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my	999
	son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not	999
	being gracious, than they are in losing them when	999
	they have approved their virtues.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What	999
	his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I	999
	have missingly noted, he is of late much retired	999
	from court and is less frequent to his princely	999
	exercises than formerly he hath appeared.	999
	999
POLIXENES	I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some	999
	care; so far that I have eyes under my service which	999
	look upon his removedness; from whom I have this	999
	intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a	999
	most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from	999
	very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his	999
	neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.	999
	999
CAMILLO	I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a	999
	daughter of most rare note: the report of her is	999
	extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.	999
	999
POLIXENES	That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I	999
	fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou	999
	shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not	999
	appearing what we are, have some question with the	999
	shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not	999
	uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.	999
	Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and	999
	lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.	999
	999
CAMILLO	I willingly obey your command.	999
	999
POLIXENES	My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.	999
	999

	THE WINTER'S TALE	999
	999
	999
ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	A road near the Shepherd's cottage.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing]	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	When daffodils begin to peer,	999
	With heigh! the doxy over the dale,	999
	Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;	999
	For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.	999
	999
	The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,	999
	With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!	999
	Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;	999
	For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.	999
	999
	The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,	999
	With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,	999
	Are summer songs for me and my aunts,	999
	While we lie tumbling in the hay.	999
	999
	I have served Prince Florizel and in my time	999
	wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:	999
	999
	But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?	999
	The pale moon shines by night:	999
	And when I wander here and there,	999
	I then do most go right.	999
	999
	If tinkers may have leave to live,	999
	And bear the sow-skin budget,	999
	Then my account I well may, give,	999
	And in the stocks avouch it.	999
	999
	My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to	999
	lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who	999
	being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise	999
	a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and	999
	drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is	999
	the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful	999
	on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to	999
	me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought	999
	of it. A prize! a prize!	999
	999
	[Enter Clown]	999
	999
Clown	Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod	999
	yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred	999
	shorn. what comes the wool to?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	[Aside]	999
	999
	If the springe hold, the cock's mine.	999
	999
Clown	I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am	999
	I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound	999
	of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will	999
	this sister of mine do with rice? But my father	999
	hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it	999
	on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for	999
	the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good	999
	ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but	999
	one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to	999
	horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden	999
	pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;	999
	nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I	999
	may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of	999
	raisins o' the sun.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	O that ever I was born!	999
	999
	[Grovelling on the ground]	999
	999
Clown	I' the name of me--	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and	999
	then, death, death!	999
	999
Clown	Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay	999
	on thee, rather than have these off.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more	999
	than the stripes I have received, which are mighty	999
	ones and millions.	999
	999
Clown	Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a	999
	great matter.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel	999
	ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon	999
	me.	999
	999
Clown	What, by a horseman, or a footman?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	A footman, sweet sir, a footman.	999
	999
Clown	Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he	999
	has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,	999
	it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,	999
	I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	O, good sir, tenderly, O!	999
	999
Clown	Alas, poor soul!	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my	999
	shoulder-blade is out.	999
	999
Clown	How now! canst stand?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	[Picking his pocket]	999
	999
	Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done me	999
	a charitable office.	999
	999
Clown	Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have	999
	a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,	999
	unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or	999
	any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;	999
	that kills my heart.	999
	999
Clown	What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with	999
	troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the	999
	prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his	999
	virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.	999
	999
Clown	His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped	999
	out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay	999
	there; and yet it will no more but abide.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he	999
	hath been since an ape-bearer; then a	999
	process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a	999
	motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's	999
	wife within a mile where my land and living lies;	999
	and, having flown over many knavish professions, he	999
	settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.	999
	999
Clown	Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts	999
	wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that	999
	put me into this apparel.	999
	999
Clown	Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had	999
	but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am	999
	false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant	999
	him.	999
	999
Clown	How do you now?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and	999
	walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace	999
	softly towards my kinsman's.	999
	999
Clown	Shall I bring thee on the way?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.	999
	999
Clown	Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our	999
	sheep-shearing.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Prosper you, sweet sir!	999
	999
	[Exit Clown]	999
	999
	Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.	999
	I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I	999
	make not this cheat bring out another and the	999
	shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name	999
	put in the book of virtue!	999
	999
	[Sings]	999
	999
	Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,	999
	And merrily hent the stile-a:	999
	A merry heart goes all the day,	999
	Your sad tires in a mile-a.	999
	999

	THE WINTER'S TALE	999
	999
	999
ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE IV	The Shepherd's cottage.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA]	999
	999
FLORIZEL	These your unusual weeds to each part of you	999
	Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora	999
	Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing	999
	Is as a meeting of the petty gods,	999
	And you the queen on't.	999
	999
PERDITA	Sir, my gracious lord,	999
	To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:	999
	O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,	999
	The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured	999
	With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,	999
	Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts	999
	In every mess have folly and the feeders	999
	Digest it with a custom, I should blush	999
	To see you so attired, sworn, I think,	999
	To show myself a glass.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	I bless the time	999
	When my good falcon made her flight across	999
	Thy father's ground.	999
	999
PERDITA	Now Jove afford you cause!	999
	To me the difference forges dread; your greatness	999
	Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble	999
	To think your father, by some accident,	999
	Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!	999
	How would he look, to see his work so noble	999
	Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how	999
	Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold	999
	The sternness of his presence?	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Apprehend	999
	Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,	999
	Humbling their deities to love, have taken	999
	The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter	999
	Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune	999
	A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,	999
	Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,	999
	As I seem now. Their transformations	999
	Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,	999
	Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires	999
	Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts	999
	Burn hotter than my faith.	999
	999
PERDITA	O, but, sir,	999
	Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis	999
	Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:	999
	One of these two must be necessities,	999
	Which then will speak, that you must	999
	change this purpose,	999
	Or I my life.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	                  Thou dearest Perdita,	999
	With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not	999
	The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,	999
	Or not my father's. For I cannot be	999
	Mine own, nor any thing to any, if	999
	I be not thine. To this I am most constant,	999
	Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;	999
	Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing	999
	That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:	999
	Lift up your countenance, as it were the day	999
	Of celebration of that nuptial which	999
	We two have sworn shall come.	999
	999
PERDITA	O lady Fortune,	999
	Stand you auspicious!	999
	999
FLORIZEL	See, your guests approach:	999
	Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,	999
	And let's be red with mirth.	999
	999
	[Enter Shepherd, Clown, MOPSA, DORCAS, and	999
	others, with POLIXENES and CAMILLO disguised]	999
	999
Shepherd	Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon	999
	This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,	999
	Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;	999
	Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,	999
	At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;	999
	On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire	999
	With labour and the thing she took to quench it,	999
	She would to each one sip. You are retired,	999
	As if you were a feasted one and not	999
	The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid	999
	These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is	999
	A way to make us better friends, more known.	999
	Come, quench your blushes and present yourself	999
	That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,	999
	And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,	999
	As your good flock shall prosper.	999
	999
PERDITA	[To POLIXENES]                  Sir, welcome:	999
	It is my father's will I should take on me	999
	The hostess-ship o' the day.	999
	999
	[To CAMILLO]	999
	999
		       You're welcome, sir.	999
	Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,	999
	For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep	999
	Seeming and savour all the winter long:	999
	Grace and remembrance be to you both,	999
	And welcome to our shearing!	999
	999
POLIXENES	Shepherdess,	999
	A fair one are you--well you fit our ages	999
	With flowers of winter.	999
	999
PERDITA	Sir, the year growing ancient,	999
	Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth	999
	Of trembling winter, the fairest	999
	flowers o' the season	999
	Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,	999
	Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind	999
	Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not	999
	To get slips of them.	999
	999
POLIXENES	Wherefore, gentle maiden,	999
	Do you neglect them?	999
	999
PERDITA	For I have heard it said	999
	There is an art which in their piedness shares	999
	With great creating nature.	999
	999
POLIXENES	Say there be;	999
	Yet nature is made better by no mean	999
	But nature makes that mean: so, over that art	999
	Which you say adds to nature, is an art	999
	That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry	999
	A gentler scion to the wildest stock,	999
	And make conceive a bark of baser kind	999
	By bud of nobler race: this is an art	999
	Which does mend nature, change it rather, but	999
	The art itself is nature.	999
	999
PERDITA	So it is.	999
	999
POLIXENES	Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,	999
	And do not call them bastards.	999
	999
PERDITA	I'll not put	999
	The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;	999
	No more than were I painted I would wish	999
	This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore	999
	Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;	999
	Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;	999
	The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun	999
	And with him rises weeping: these are flowers	999
	Of middle summer, and I think they are given	999
	To men of middle age. You're very welcome.	999
	999
CAMILLO	I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,	999
	And only live by gazing.	999
	999
PERDITA	Out, alas!	999
	You'd be so lean, that blasts of January	999
	Would blow you through and through.	999
	Now, my fair'st friend,	999
	I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might	999
	Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,	999
	That wear upon your virgin branches yet	999
	Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,	999
	For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall	999
	From Dis's waggon! daffodils,	999
	That come before the swallow dares, and take	999
	The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,	999
	But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes	999
	Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses	999
	That die unmarried, ere they can behold	999
	Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady	999
	Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and	999
	The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,	999
	The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,	999
	To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,	999
	To strew him o'er and o'er!	999
	999
FLORIZEL	What, like a corse?	999
	999
PERDITA	No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;	999
	Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,	999
	But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:	999
	Methinks I play as I have seen them do	999
	In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine	999
	Does change my disposition.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	What you do	999
	Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.	999
	I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,	999
	I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,	999
	Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,	999
	To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you	999
	A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do	999
	Nothing but that; move still, still so,	999
	And own no other function: each your doing,	999
	So singular in each particular,	999
	Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,	999
	That all your acts are queens.	999
	999
PERDITA	O Doricles,	999
	Your praises are too large: but that your youth,	999
	And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,	999
	Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,	999
	With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,	999
	You woo'd me the false way.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	I think you have	999
	As little skill to fear as I have purpose	999
	To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:	999
	Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,	999
	That never mean to part.	999
	999
PERDITA	I'll swear for 'em.	999
	999
POLIXENES	This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever	999
	Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems	999
	But smacks of something greater than herself,	999
	Too noble for this place.	999
	999
CAMILLO	He tells her something	999
	That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is	999
	The queen of curds and cream.	999
	999
Clown	Come on, strike up!	999
	999
DORCAS	Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,	999
	To mend her kissing with!	999
	999
MOPSA	Now, in good time!	999
	999
Clown	Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.	999
	Come, strike up!	999
	999
	[Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and	999
	Shepherdesses]	999
	999
POLIXENES	Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this	999
	Which dances with your daughter?	999
	999
Shepherd	They call him Doricles; and boasts himself	999
	To have a worthy feeding: but I have it	999
	Upon his own report and I believe it;	999
	He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:	999
	I think so too; for never gazed the moon	999
	Upon the water as he'll stand and read	999
	As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.	999
	I think there is not half a kiss to choose	999
	Who loves another best.	999
	999
POLIXENES	She dances featly.	999
	999
Shepherd	So she does any thing; though I report it,	999
	That should be silent: if young Doricles	999
	Do light upon her, she shall bring him that	999
	Which he not dreams of.	999
	999
	[Enter Servant]	999
	999
Servant	O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the	999
	door, you would never dance again after a tabour and	999
	pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings	999
	several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he	999
	utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's	999
	ears grew to his tunes.	999
	999
Clown	He could never come better; he shall come in. I	999
	love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful	999
	matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing	999
	indeed and sung lamentably.	999
	999
Servant	He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no	999
	milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he	999
	has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without	999
	bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate	999
	burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump	999
	her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,	999
	as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into	999
	the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me	999
	no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with	999
	'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'	999
	999
POLIXENES	This is a brave fellow.	999
	999
Clown	Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited	999
	fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?	999
	999
Servant	He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;	999
	points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can	999
	learnedly handle, though they come to him by the	999
	gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he	999
	sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you	999
	would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants	999
	to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.	999
	999
Clown	Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.	999
	999
PERDITA	Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant]	999
	999
Clown	You have of these pedlars, that have more in them	999
	than you'ld think, sister.	999
	999
PERDITA	Ay, good brother, or go about to think.	999
	999
	[Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing]	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	     Lawn as white as driven snow;	999
	Cyprus black as e'er was crow;	999
	Gloves as sweet as damask roses;	999
	Masks for faces and for noses;	999
	Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,	999
	Perfume for a lady's chamber;	999
	Golden quoifs and stomachers,	999
	For my lads to give their dears:	999
	Pins and poking-sticks of steel,	999
	What maids lack from head to heel:	999
	Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;	999
	Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.	999
	999
Clown	If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take	999
	no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it	999
	will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.	999
	999
MOPSA	I was promised them against the feast; but they come	999
	not too late now.	999
	999
DORCAS	He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.	999
	999
MOPSA	He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has	999
	paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.	999
	999
Clown	Is there no manners left among maids? will they	999
	wear their plackets where they should bear their	999
	faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are	999
	going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these	999
	secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all	999
	our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour	999
	your tongues, and not a word more.	999
	999
MOPSA	I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace	999
	and a pair of sweet gloves.	999
	999
Clown	Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way	999
	and lost all my money?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;	999
	therefore it behoves men to be wary.	999
	999
Clown	Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.	999
	999
Clown	What hast here? ballads?	999
	999
MOPSA	Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'	999
	life, for then we are sure they are true.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's	999
	wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a	999
	burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and	999
	toads carbonadoed.	999
	999
MOPSA	Is it true, think you?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Very true, and but a month old.	999
	999
DORCAS	Bless me from marrying a usurer!	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress	999
	Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were	999
	present. Why should I carry lies abroad?	999
	999
MOPSA	Pray you now, buy it.	999
	999
Clown	Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe	999
	ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon	999
	the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,	999
	forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this	999
	ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was	999
	thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold	999
	fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that	999
	loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.	999
	999
DORCAS	Is it true too, think you?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than	999
	my pack will hold.	999
	999
Clown	Lay it by too: another.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.	999
	999
MOPSA	Let's have some merry ones.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to	999
	the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's	999
	scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in	999
	request, I can tell you.	999
	999
MOPSA	We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou	999
	shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.	999
	999
DORCAS	We had the tune on't a month ago.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my	999
	occupation; have at it with you.	999
	[SONG]	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Get you hence, for I must go	999
	Where it fits not you to know.	999
	999
DORCAS	     Whither?	999
	999
MOPSA	                  O, whither?	999
	999
DORCAS	Whither?	999
	999
MOPSA	     It becomes thy oath full well,	999
	Thou to me thy secrets tell.	999
	999
DORCAS	          Me too, let me go thither.	999
	999
MOPSA	     Or thou goest to the orange or mill.	999
	999
DORCAS	     If to either, thou dost ill.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Neither.	999
	999
DORCAS	       What, neither?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Neither.	999
	999
DORCAS	     Thou hast sworn my love to be.	999
	999
MOPSA	     Thou hast sworn it more to me:	999
	Then whither goest? say, whither?	999
	999
Clown	We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my	999
	father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll	999
	not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after	999
	me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's	999
	have the first choice. Follow me, girls.	999
	999
	[Exit with DORCAS and MOPSA]	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	And you shall pay well for 'em.	999
	999
	[Follows singing]	999
	999
	Will you buy any tape,	999
	Or lace for your cape,	999
	My dainty duck, my dear-a?	999
	Any silk, any thread,	999
	Any toys for your head,	999
	Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?	999
	Come to the pedlar;	999
	Money's a medler.	999
	That doth utter all men's ware-a.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Re-enter Servant]	999
	999
Servant	Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,	999
	three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made	999
	themselves all men of hair, they call themselves	999
	Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches	999
	say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are	999
	not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it	999
	be not too rough for some that know little but	999
	bowling, it will please plentifully.	999
	999
Shepherd	Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much	999
	homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.	999
	999
POLIXENES	You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see	999
	these four threes of herdsmen.	999
	999
Servant	One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath	999
	danced before the king; and not the worst of the	999
	three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.	999
	999
Shepherd	Leave your prating: since these good men are	999
	pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.	999
	999
Servant	Why, they stay at door, sir.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Here a dance of twelve Satyrs]	999
	999
POLIXENES	O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.	999
	999
	[To CAMILLO]	999
	999
	Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.	999
	He's simple and tells much.	999
	999
	[To FLORIZEL]	999
	999
		      How now, fair shepherd!	999
	Your heart is full of something that does take	999
	Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young	999
	And handed love as you do, I was wont	999
	To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd	999
	The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it	999
	To her acceptance; you have let him go	999
	And nothing marted with him. If your lass	999
	Interpretation should abuse and call this	999
	Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited	999
	For a reply, at least if you make a care	999
	Of happy holding her.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Old sir, I know	999
	She prizes not such trifles as these are:	999
	The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd	999
	Up in my heart; which I have given already,	999
	But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life	999
	Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,	999
	Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,	999
	As soft as dove's down and as white as it,	999
	Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd	999
	snow that's bolted	999
	By the northern blasts twice o'er.	999
	999
POLIXENES	What follows this?	999
	How prettily the young swain seems to wash	999
	The hand was fair before! I have put you out:	999
	But to your protestation; let me hear	999
	What you profess.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	                  Do, and be witness to 't.	999
	999
POLIXENES	And this my neighbour too?	999
	999
FLORIZEL	And he, and more	999
	Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:	999
	That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,	999
	Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth	999
	That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge	999
	More than was ever man's, I would not prize them	999
	Without her love; for her employ them all;	999
	Commend them and condemn them to her service	999
	Or to their own perdition.	999
	999
POLIXENES	Fairly offer'd.	999
	999
CAMILLO	This shows a sound affection.	999
	999
Shepherd	But, my daughter,	999
	Say you the like to him?	999
	999
PERDITA	I cannot speak	999
	So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:	999
	By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out	999
	The purity of his.	999
	999
Shepherd	                  Take hands, a bargain!	999
	And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:	999
	I give my daughter to him, and will make	999
	Her portion equal his.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	O, that must be	999
	I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,	999
	I shall have more than you can dream of yet;	999
	Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,	999
	Contract us 'fore these witnesses.	999
	999
Shepherd	Come, your hand;	999
	And, daughter, yours.	999
	999
POLIXENES	Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;	999
	Have you a father?	999
	999
FLORIZEL	                  I have: but what of him?	999
	999
POLIXENES	Knows he of this?	999
	999
FLORIZEL	                  He neither does nor shall.	999
	999
POLIXENES	Methinks a father	999
	Is at the nuptial of his son a guest	999
	That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,	999
	Is not your father grown incapable	999
	Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid	999
	With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?	999
	Know man from man? dispute his own estate?	999
	Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing	999
	But what he did being childish?	999
	999
FLORIZEL	No, good sir;	999
	He has his health and ampler strength indeed	999
	Than most have of his age.	999
	999
POLIXENES	By my white beard,	999
	You offer him, if this be so, a wrong	999
	Something unfilial: reason my son	999
	Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason	999
	The father, all whose joy is nothing else	999
	But fair posterity, should hold some counsel	999
	In such a business.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	I yield all this;	999
	But for some other reasons, my grave sir,	999
	Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint	999
	My father of this business.	999
	999
POLIXENES	Let him know't.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	He shall not.	999
	999
POLIXENES	                  Prithee, let him.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	No, he must not.	999
	999
Shepherd	Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve	999
	At knowing of thy choice.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Come, come, he must not.	999
	Mark our contract.	999
	999
POLIXENES	                  Mark your divorce, young sir,	999
	999
	[Discovering himself]	999
	999
	Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base	999
	To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,	999
	That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,	999
	I am sorry that by hanging thee I can	999
	But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece	999
	Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know	999
	The royal fool thou copest with,--	999
	999
Shepherd	O, my heart!	999
	999
POLIXENES	I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made	999
	More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,	999
	If I may ever know thou dost but sigh	999
	That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never	999
	I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;	999
	Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,	999
	Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:	999
	Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,	999
	Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee	999
	From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--	999
	Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,	999
	That makes himself, but for our honour therein,	999
	Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou	999
	These rural latches to his entrance open,	999
	Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,	999
	I will devise a death as cruel for thee	999
	As thou art tender to't.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PERDITA	Even here undone!	999
	I was not much afeard; for once or twice	999
	I was about to speak and tell him plainly,	999
	The selfsame sun that shines upon his court	999
	Hides not his visage from our cottage but	999
	Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?	999
	I told you what would come of this: beseech you,	999
	Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--	999
	Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,	999
	But milk my ewes and weep.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Why, how now, father!	999
	Speak ere thou diest.	999
	999
Shepherd	I cannot speak, nor think	999
	Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!	999
	You have undone a man of fourscore three,	999
	That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,	999
	To die upon the bed my father died,	999
	To lie close by his honest bones: but now	999
	Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me	999
	Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,	999
	That knew'st this was the prince,	999
	and wouldst adventure	999
	To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!	999
	If I might die within this hour, I have lived	999
	To die when I desire.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Why look you so upon me?	999
	I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,	999
	But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;	999
	More straining on for plucking back, not following	999
	My leash unwillingly.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Gracious my lord,	999
	You know your father's temper: at this time	999
	He will allow no speech, which I do guess	999
	You do not purpose to him; and as hardly	999
	Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:	999
	Then, till the fury of his highness settle,	999
	Come not before him.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	I not purpose it.	999
	I think, Camillo?	999
	999
CAMILLO	                  Even he, my lord.	999
	999
PERDITA	How often have I told you 'twould be thus!	999
	How often said, my dignity would last	999
	But till 'twere known!	999
	999
FLORIZEL	It cannot fail but by	999
	The violation of my faith; and then	999
	Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together	999
	And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:	999
	From my succession wipe me, father; I	999
	Am heir to my affection.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Be advised.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	I am, and by my fancy: if my reason	999
	Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;	999
	If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,	999
	Do bid it welcome.	999
	999
CAMILLO	                  This is desperate, sir.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;	999
	I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,	999
	Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may	999
	Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or	999
	The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides	999
	In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath	999
	To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,	999
	As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,	999
	When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not	999
	To see him any more,--cast your good counsels	999
	Upon his passion; let myself and fortune	999
	Tug for the time to come. This you may know	999
	And so deliver, I am put to sea	999
	With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;	999
	And most opportune to our need I have	999
	A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared	999
	For this design. What course I mean to hold	999
	Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor	999
	Concern me the reporting.	999
	999
CAMILLO	O my lord!	999
	I would your spirit were easier for advice,	999
	Or stronger for your need.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Hark, Perdita	999
	999
	[Drawing her aside]	999
	999
	I'll hear you by and by.	999
	999
CAMILLO	He's irremoveable,	999
	Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if	999
	His going I could frame to serve my turn,	999
	Save him from danger, do him love and honour,	999
	Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia	999
	And that unhappy king, my master, whom	999
	I so much thirst to see.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Now, good Camillo;	999
	I am so fraught with curious business that	999
	I leave out ceremony.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Sir, I think	999
	You have heard of my poor services, i' the love	999
	That I have borne your father?	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Very nobly	999
	Have you deserved: it is my father's music	999
	To speak your deeds, not little of his care	999
	To have them recompensed as thought on.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Well, my lord,	999
	If you may please to think I love the king	999
	And through him what is nearest to him, which is	999
	Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:	999
	If your more ponderous and settled project	999
	May suffer alteration, on mine honour,	999
	I'll point you where you shall have such receiving	999
	As shall become your highness; where you may	999
	Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,	999
	There's no disjunction to be made, but by--	999
	As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,	999
	And, with my best endeavours in your absence,	999
	Your discontenting father strive to qualify	999
	And bring him up to liking.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	How, Camillo,	999
	May this, almost a miracle, be done?	999
	That I may call thee something more than man	999
	And after that trust to thee.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Have you thought on	999
	A place whereto you'll go?	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Not any yet:	999
	But as the unthought-on accident is guilty	999
	To what we wildly do, so we profess	999
	Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies	999
	Of every wind that blows.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Then list to me:	999
	This follows, if you will not change your purpose	999
	But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,	999
	And there present yourself and your fair princess,	999
	For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:	999
	She shall be habited as it becomes	999
	The partner of your bed. Methinks I see	999
	Leontes opening his free arms and weeping	999
	His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,	999
	As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands	999
	Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him	999
	'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one	999
	He chides to hell and bids the other grow	999
	Faster than thought or time.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Worthy Camillo,	999
	What colour for my visitation shall I	999
	Hold up before him?	999
	999
CAMILLO	Sent by the king your father	999
	To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,	999
	The manner of your bearing towards him, with	999
	What you as from your father shall deliver,	999
	Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:	999
	The which shall point you forth at every sitting	999
	What you must say; that he shall not perceive	999
	But that you have your father's bosom there	999
	And speak his very heart.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	I am bound to you:	999
	There is some sap in this.	999
	999
CAMILLO	A cause more promising	999
	Than a wild dedication of yourselves	999
	To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain	999
	To miseries enough; no hope to help you,	999
	But as you shake off one to take another;	999
	Nothing so certain as your anchors, who	999
	Do their best office, if they can but stay you	999
	Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know	999
	Prosperity's the very bond of love,	999
	Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together	999
	Affliction alters.	999
	999
PERDITA	                  One of these is true:	999
	I think affliction may subdue the cheek,	999
	But not take in the mind.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Yea, say you so?	999
	There shall not at your father's house these	999
	seven years	999
	Be born another such.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	My good Camillo,	999
	She is as forward of her breeding as	999
	She is i' the rear our birth.	999
	999
CAMILLO	I cannot say 'tis pity	999
	She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress	999
	To most that teach.	999
	999
PERDITA	Your pardon, sir; for this	999
	I'll blush you thanks.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	My prettiest Perdita!	999
	But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,	999
	Preserver of my father, now of me,	999
	The medicine of our house, how shall we do?	999
	We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,	999
	Nor shall appear in Sicilia.	999
	999
CAMILLO	My lord,	999
	Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes	999
	Do all lie there: it shall be so my care	999
	To have you royally appointed as if	999
	The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,	999
	That you may know you shall not want, one word.	999
	999
	[They talk aside]	999
	999
	[Re-enter AUTOLYCUS]	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his	999
	sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold	999
	all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a	999
	ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,	999
	knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,	999
	to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who	999
	should buy first, as if my trinkets had been	999
	hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:	999
	by which means I saw whose purse was best in	999
	picture; and what I saw, to my good use I	999
	remembered. My clown, who wants but something to	999
	be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the	999
	wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes	999
	till he had both tune and words; which so drew the	999
	rest of the herd to me that all their other senses	999
	stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it	999
	was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a	999
	purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in	999
	chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,	999
	and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this	999
	time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their	999
	festival purses; and had not the old man come in	999
	with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's	999
	son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not	999
	left a purse alive in the whole army.	999
	999
	[CAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward]	999
	999
CAMILLO	Nay, but my letters, by this means being there	999
	So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--	999
	999
CAMILLO	Shall satisfy your father.	999
	999
PERDITA	Happy be you!	999
	All that you speak shows fair.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Who have we here?	999
	999
	[Seeing AUTOLYCUS]	999
	999
	We'll make an instrument of this, omit	999
	Nothing may give us aid.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.	999
	999
CAMILLO	How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear	999
	not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	I am a poor fellow, sir.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from	999
	thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must	999
	make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,	999
	--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and	999
	change garments with this gentleman: though the	999
	pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,	999
	there's some boot.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	I am a poor fellow, sir.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
		   I know ye well enough.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half	999
	flayed already.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Are you in earnest, sir?	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
		   I smell the trick on't.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Dispatch, I prithee.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with	999
	conscience take it.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Unbuckle, unbuckle.	999
	999
	[FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments]	999
	999
	Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy	999
	Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself	999
	Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat	999
	And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,	999
	Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken	999
	The truth of your own seeming; that you may--	999
	For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard	999
	Get undescried.	999
	999
PERDITA	                  I see the play so lies	999
	That I must bear a part.	999
	999
CAMILLO	No remedy.	999
	Have you done there?	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Should I now meet my father,	999
	He would not call me son.	999
	999
CAMILLO	Nay, you shall have no hat.	999
	999
	[Giving it to PERDITA]	999
	999
	Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Adieu, sir.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!	999
	Pray you, a word.	999
	999
CAMILLO	[Aside]  What I do next, shall be to tell the king	999
	Of this escape and whither they are bound;	999
	Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail	999
	To force him after: in whose company	999
	I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight	999
	I have a woman's longing.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Fortune speed us!	999
	Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.	999
	999
CAMILLO	The swifter speed the better.	999
	999
	[Exeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO]	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	I understand the business, I hear it: to have an	999
	open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is	999
	necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite	999
	also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see	999
	this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.	999
	What an exchange had this been without boot! What	999
	a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do	999
	this year connive at us, and we may do any thing	999
	extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of	999
	iniquity, stealing away from his father with his	999
	clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of	999
	honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not	999
	do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;	999
	and therein am I constant to my profession.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Clown and Shepherd]	999
	999
	Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:	999
	every lane's end, every shop, church, session,	999
	hanging, yields a careful man work.	999
	999
Clown	See, see; what a man you are now!	999
	There is no other way but to tell the king	999
	she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.	999
	999
Shepherd	Nay, but hear me.	999
	999
Clown	Nay, but hear me.	999
	999
Shepherd	Go to, then.	999
	999
Clown	She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh	999
	and blood has not offended the king; and so your	999
	flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show	999
	those things you found about her, those secret	999
	things, all but what she has with her: this being	999
	done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.	999
	999
Shepherd	I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his	999
	son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,	999
	neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make	999
	me the king's brother-in-law.	999
	999
Clown	Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you	999
	could have been to him and then your blood had been	999
	the dearer by I know how much an ounce.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	[Aside]  Very wisely, puppies!	999
	999
Shepherd	Well, let us to the king: there is that in this	999
	fardel will make him scratch his beard.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	[Aside]  I know not what impediment this complaint	999
	may be to the flight of my master.	999
	999
Clown	Pray heartily he be at palace.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	[Aside]  Though I am not naturally honest, I am so	999
	sometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.	999
	999
	[Takes off his false beard]	999
	999
	How now, rustics! whither are you bound?	999
	999
Shepherd	To the palace, an it like your worship.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition	999
	of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your	999
	names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any	999
	thing that is fitting to be known, discover.	999
	999
Clown	We are but plain fellows, sir.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no	999
	lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they	999
	often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for	999
	it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore	999
	they do not give us the lie.	999
	999
Clown	Your worship had like to have given us one, if you	999
	had not taken yourself with the manner.	999
	999
Shepherd	Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest	999
	thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?	999
	hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?	999
	receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I	999
	not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,	999
	for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy	999
	business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier	999
	cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck	999
	back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to	999
	open thy affair.	999
	999
Shepherd	My business, sir, is to the king.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	What advocate hast thou to him?	999
	999
Shepherd	I know not, an't like you.	999
	999
Clown	Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you	999
	have none.	999
	999
Shepherd	None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	How blessed are we that are not simple men!	999
	Yet nature might have made me as these are,	999
	Therefore I will not disdain.	999
	999
Clown	This cannot be but a great courtier.	999
	999
Shepherd	His garments are rich, but he wears	999
	them not handsomely.	999
	999
Clown	He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:	999
	a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking	999
	on's teeth.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?	999
	Wherefore that box?	999
	999
Shepherd	Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,	999
	which none must know but the king; and which he	999
	shall know within this hour, if I may come to the	999
	speech of him.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Age, thou hast lost thy labour.	999
	999
Shepherd	Why, sir?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a	999
	new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,	999
	if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must	999
	know the king is full of grief.	999
	999
Shepard	So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have	999
	married a shepherd's daughter.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:	999
	the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall	999
	feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.	999
	999
Clown	Think you so, sir?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy	999
	and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to	999
	him, though removed fifty times, shall all come	999
	under the hangman: which though it be great pity,	999
	yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a	999
	ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into	999
	grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death	999
	is too soft for him, say I	draw our throne into a	999
	sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.	999
	999
Clown	Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't	999
	like you, sir?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then	999
	'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a	999
	wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters	999
	and a dram dead; then recovered again with	999
	aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as	999
	he is, and in the hottest day prognostication	999
	proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the	999
	sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he	999
	is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what	999
	talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries	999
	are to be smiled at, their offences being so	999
	capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain	999
	men, what you have to the king: being something	999
	gently considered, I'll bring you where he is	999
	aboard, tender your persons to his presence,	999
	whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man	999
	besides the king to effect your suits, here is man	999
	shall do it.	999
	999
Clown	He seems to be of great authority: close with him,	999
	give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn	999
	bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show	999
	the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,	999
	and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'	999
	999
Shepherd	An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for	999
	us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much	999
	more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	After I have done what I promised?	999
	999
Shepherd	Ay, sir.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?	999
	999
Clown	In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful	999
	one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,	999
	he'll be made an example.	999
	999
Clown	Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show	999
	our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your	999
	daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I	999
	will give you as much as this old man does when the	999
	business is performed, and remain, as he says, your	999
	pawn till it be brought you.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;	999
	go on the right hand: I will but look upon the	999
	hedge and follow you.	999
	999
Clown	We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.	999
	999
Shepherd	Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Shepherd and Clown]	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would	999
	not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am	999
	courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means	999
	to do the prince my master good; which who knows how	999
	that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring	999
	these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he	999
	think it fit to shore them again and that the	999
	complaint they have to the king concerns him	999
	nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far	999
	officious; for I am proof against that title and	999
	what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present	999
	them: there may be matter in it.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999

	THE WINTER'S TALE	999
	999
	999
ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A room in LEONTES' palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants]	999
	999
CLEOMENES	Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd	999
	A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,	999
	Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down	999
	More penitence than done trespass: at the last,	999
	Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;	999
	With them forgive yourself.	999
	999
LEONTES	Whilst I remember	999
	Her and her virtues, I cannot forget	999
	My blemishes in them, and so still think of	999
	The wrong I did myself; which was so much,	999
	That heirless it hath made my kingdom and	999
	Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man	999
	Bred his hopes out of.	999
	999
PAULINA	True, too true, my lord:	999
	If, one by one, you wedded all the world,	999
	Or from the all that are took something good,	999
	To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd	999
	Would be unparallel'd.	999
	999
LEONTES	I think so. Kill'd!	999
	She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me	999
	Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter	999
	Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,	999
	Say so but seldom.	999
	999
CLEOMENES	                  Not at all, good lady:	999
	You might have spoken a thousand things that would	999
	Have done the time more benefit and graced	999
	Your kindness better.	999
	999
PAULINA	You are one of those	999
	Would have him wed again.	999
	999
DION	If you would not so,	999
	You pity not the state, nor the remembrance	999
	Of his most sovereign name; consider little	999
	What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,	999
	May drop upon his kingdom and devour	999
	Incertain lookers on. What were more holy	999
	Than to rejoice the former queen is well?	999
	What holier than, for royalty's repair,	999
	For present comfort and for future good,	999
	To bless the bed of majesty again	999
	With a sweet fellow to't?	999
	999
PAULINA	There is none worthy,	999
	Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods	999
	Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;	999
	For has not the divine Apollo said,	999
	Is't not the tenor of his oracle,	999
	That King Leontes shall not have an heir	999
	Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,	999
	Is all as monstrous to our human reason	999
	As my Antigonus to break his grave	999
	And come again to me; who, on my life,	999
	Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel	999
	My lord should to the heavens be contrary,	999
	Oppose against their wills.	999
	999
	[To LEONTES]	999
	999
		      Care not for issue;	999
	The crown will find an heir: great Alexander	999
	Left his to the worthiest; so his successor	999
	Was like to be the best.	999
	999
LEONTES	Good Paulina,	999
	Who hast the memory of Hermione,	999
	I know, in honour, O, that ever I	999
	Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,	999
	I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,	999
	Have taken treasure from her lips--	999
	999
PAULINA	And left them	999
	More rich for what they yielded.	999
	999
LEONTES	Thou speak'st truth.	999
	No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,	999
	And better used, would make her sainted spirit	999
	Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,	999
	Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,	999
	And begin, 'Why to me?'	999
	999
PAULINA	Had she such power,	999
	She had just cause.	999
	999
LEONTES	She had; and would incense me	999
	To murder her I married.	999
	999
PAULINA	I should so.	999
	Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark	999
	Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't	999
	You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears	999
	Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd	999
	Should be 'Remember mine.'	999
	999
LEONTES	Stars, stars,	999
	And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;	999
	I'll have no wife, Paulina.	999
	999
PAULINA	Will you swear	999
	Never to marry but by my free leave?	999
	999
LEONTES	Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!	999
	999
PAULINA	Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.	999
	999
CLEOMENES	You tempt him over-much.	999
	999
PAULINA	Unless another,	999
	As like Hermione as is her picture,	999
	Affront his eye.	999
	999
CLEOMENES	                  Good madam,--	999
	999
PAULINA	I have done.	999
	Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,	999
	No remedy, but you will,--give me the office	999
	To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young	999
	As was your former; but she shall be such	999
	As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,	999
	it should take joy	999
	To see her in your arms.	999
	999
LEONTES	My true Paulina,	999
	We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.	999
	999
PAULINA	That	999
	Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;	999
	Never till then.	999
	999
	[Enter a Gentleman]	999
	999
Gentleman	One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,	999
	Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she	999
	The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access	999
	To your high presence.	999
	999
LEONTES	What with him? he comes not	999
	Like to his father's greatness: his approach,	999
	So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us	999
	'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced	999
	By need and accident. What train?	999
	999
Gentleman	But few,	999
	And those but mean.	999
	999
LEONTES	His princess, say you, with him?	999
	999
Gentleman	Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,	999
	That e'er the sun shone bright on.	999
	999
PAULINA	O Hermione,	999
	As every present time doth boast itself	999
	Above a better gone, so must thy grave	999
	Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself	999
	Have said and writ so, but your writing now	999
	Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,	999
	Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse	999
	Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,	999
	To say you have seen a better.	999
	999
Gentleman	Pardon, madam:	999
	The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--	999
	The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,	999
	Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,	999
	Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal	999
	Of all professors else, make proselytes	999
	Of who she but bid follow.	999
	999
PAULINA	How! not women?	999
	999
Gentleman	Women will love her, that she is a woman	999
	More worth than any man; men, that she is	999
	The rarest of all women.	999
	999
LEONTES	Go, Cleomenes;	999
	Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,	999
	Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange	999
	999
	[Exeunt CLEOMENES and others]	999
	999
	He thus should steal upon us.	999
	999
PAULINA	Had our prince,	999
	Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd	999
	Well with this lord: there was not full a month	999
	Between their births.	999
	999
LEONTES	Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st	999
	He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,	999
	When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches	999
	Will bring me to consider that which may	999
	Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.	999
	999
	[Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA]	999
	999
	Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;	999
	For she did print your royal father off,	999
	Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,	999
	Your father's image is so hit in you,	999
	His very air, that I should call you brother,	999
	As I did him, and speak of something wildly	999
	By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!	999
	And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!	999
	I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth	999
	Might thus have stood begetting wonder as	999
	You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--	999
	All mine own folly--the society,	999
	Amity too, of your brave father, whom,	999
	Though bearing misery, I desire my life	999
	Once more to look on him.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	By his command	999
	Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him	999
	Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,	999
	Can send his brother: and, but infirmity	999
	Which waits upon worn times hath something seized	999
	His wish'd ability, he had himself	999
	The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his	999
	Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--	999
	He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres	999
	And those that bear them living.	999
	999
LEONTES	O my brother,	999
	Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir	999
	Afresh within me, and these thy offices,	999
	So rarely kind, are as interpreters	999
	Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,	999
	As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too	999
	Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,	999
	At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,	999
	To greet a man not worth her pains, much less	999
	The adventure of her person?	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Good my lord,	999
	She came from Libya.	999
	999
LEONTES	Where the warlike Smalus,	999
	That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter	999
	His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,	999
	A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,	999
	To execute the charge my father gave me	999
	For visiting your highness: my best train	999
	I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;	999
	Who for Bohemia bend, to signify	999
	Not only my success in Libya, sir,	999
	But my arrival and my wife's in safety	999
	Here where we are.	999
	999
LEONTES	                  The blessed gods	999
	Purge all infection from our air whilst you	999
	Do climate here! You have a holy father,	999
	A graceful gentleman; against whose person,	999
	So sacred as it is, I have done sin:	999
	For which the heavens, taking angry note,	999
	Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,	999
	As he from heaven merits it, with you	999
	Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,	999
	Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,	999
	Such goodly things as you!	999
	999
	[Enter a Lord]	999
	999
Lord	Most noble sir,	999
	That which I shall report will bear no credit,	999
	Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,	999
	Bohemia greets you from himself by me;	999
	Desires you to attach his son, who has--	999
	His dignity and duty both cast off--	999
	Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with	999
	A shepherd's daughter.	999
	999
LEONTES	Where's Bohemia? speak.	999
	999
Lord	Here in your city; I now came from him:	999
	I speak amazedly; and it becomes	999
	My marvel and my message. To your court	999
	Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,	999
	Of this fair couple, meets he on the way	999
	The father of this seeming lady and	999
	Her brother, having both their country quitted	999
	With this young prince.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Camillo has betray'd me;	999
	Whose honour and whose honesty till now	999
	Endured all weathers.	999
	999
Lord	Lay't so to his charge:	999
	He's with the king your father.	999
	999
LEONTES	Who? Camillo?	999
	999
Lord	Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now	999
	Has these poor men in question. Never saw I	999
	Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;	999
	Forswear themselves as often as they speak:	999
	Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them	999
	With divers deaths in death.	999
	999
PERDITA	O my poor father!	999
	The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have	999
	Our contract celebrated.	999
	999
LEONTES	You are married?	999
	999
FLORIZEL	We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;	999
	The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:	999
	The odds for high and low's alike.	999
	999
LEONTES	My lord,	999
	Is this the daughter of a king?	999
	999
FLORIZEL	She is,	999
	When once she is my wife.	999
	999
LEONTES	That 'once' I see by your good father's speed	999
	Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,	999
	Most sorry, you have broken from his liking	999
	Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry	999
	Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,	999
	That you might well enjoy her.	999
	999
FLORIZEL	Dear, look up:	999
	Though Fortune, visible an enemy,	999
	Should chase us with my father, power no jot	999
	Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,	999
	Remember since you owed no more to time	999
	Than I do now: with thought of such affections,	999
	Step forth mine advocate; at your request	999
	My father will grant precious things as trifles.	999
	999
LEONTES	Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,	999
	Which he counts but a trifle.	999
	999
PAULINA	Sir, my liege,	999
	Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month	999
	'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes	999
	Than what you look on now.	999
	999
LEONTES	I thought of her,	999
	Even in these looks I made.	999
	999
	[To FLORIZEL]	999
	999
		       But your petition	999
	Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:	999
	Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,	999
	I am friend to them and you: upon which errand	999
	I now go toward him; therefore follow me	999
	And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

	THE WINTER'S TALE	999
	999
	999
ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Before LEONTES' palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman]	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?	999
	999
First Gentleman	I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old	999
	shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:	999
	whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all	999
	commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I	999
	heard the shepherd say, he found the child.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	I would most gladly know the issue of it.	999
	999
First Gentleman	I make a broken delivery of the business; but the	999
	changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were	999
	very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with	999
	staring on one another, to tear the cases of their	999
	eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language	999
	in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard	999
	of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable	999
	passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest	999
	beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not	999
	say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the	999
	extremity of the one, it must needs be.	999
	999
	[Enter another Gentleman]	999
	999
	Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.	999
	The news, Rogero?	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the	999
	king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is	999
	broken out within this hour that ballad-makers	999
	cannot be able to express it.	999
	999
	[Enter a third Gentleman]	999
	999
	Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can	999
	deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news	999
	which is called true is so like an old tale, that	999
	the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king	999
	found his heir?	999
	999
Third Gentleman	Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by	999
	circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you	999
	see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle	999
	of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,	999
	the letters of Antigonus found with it which they	999
	know to be his character, the majesty of the	999
	creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection	999
	of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,	999
	and many other evidences proclaim her with all	999
	certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see	999
	the meeting of the two kings?	999
	999
Second Gentleman	No.	999
	999
Third Gentleman	Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,	999
	cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one	999
	joy crown another, so and in such manner that it	999
	seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their	999
	joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,	999
	holding up of hands, with countenances of such	999
	distraction that they were to be known by garment,	999
	not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of	999
	himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that	999
	joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,	999
	thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then	999
	embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his	999
	daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old	999
	shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten	999
	conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such	999
	another encounter, which lames report to follow it	999
	and undoes description to do it.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried	999
	hence the child?	999
	999
Third Gentleman	Like an old tale still, which will have matter to	999
	rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear	999
	open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this	999
	avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his	999
	innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a	999
	handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.	999
	999
First Gentleman	What became of his bark and his followers?	999
	999
Third Gentleman	Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and	999
	in the view of the shepherd: so that all the	999
	instruments which aided to expose the child were	999
	even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble	999
	combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in	999
	Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of	999
	her husband, another elevated that the oracle was	999
	fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,	999
	and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin	999
	her to her heart that she might no more be in danger	999
	of losing.	999
	999
First Gentleman	The dignity of this act was worth the audience of	999
	kings and princes; for by such was it acted.	999
	999
Third Gentleman	One of the prettiest touches of all and that which	999
	angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not	999
	the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's	999
	death, with the manner how she came to't bravely	999
	confessed and lamented by the king, how	999
	attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one	999
	sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'	999
	I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my	999
	heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed	999
	colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world	999
	could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.	999
	999
First Gentleman	Are they returned to the court?	999
	999
Third Gentleman	No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,	999
	which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many	999
	years in doing and now newly performed by that rare	999
	Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself	999
	eternity and could put breath into his work, would	999
	beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her	999
	ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that	999
	they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of	999
	answer: thither with all greediness of affection	999
	are they gone, and there they intend to sup.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	I thought she had some great matter there in hand;	999
	for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever	999
	since the death of Hermione, visited that removed	999
	house. Shall we thither and with our company piece	999
	the rejoicing?	999
	999
First Gentleman	Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?	999
	every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:	999
	our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.	999
	Let's along.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Gentlemen]	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,	999
	would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old	999
	man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard	999
	them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he	999
	at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,	999
	so he then took her to be, who began to be much	999
	sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of	999
	weather continuing, this mystery remained	999
	undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I	999
	been the finder out of this secret, it would not	999
	have relished among my other discredits.	999
	999
	[Enter Shepherd and Clown]	999
	999
	Here come those I have done good to against my will,	999
	and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.	999
	999
Shepherd	Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and	999
	daughters will be all gentlemen born.	999
	999
Clown	You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me	999
	this other day, because I was no gentleman born.	999
	See you these clothes? say you see them not and	999
	think me still no gentleman born: you were best say	999
	these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the	999
	lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.	999
	999
Clown	Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.	999
	999
Shepherd	And so have I, boy.	999
	999
Clown	So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my	999
	father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and	999
	called me brother; and then the two kings called my	999
	father brother; and then the prince my brother and	999
	the princess my sister called my father father; and	999
	so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like	999
	tears that ever we shed.	999
	999
Shepherd	We may live, son, to shed many more.	999
	999
Clown	Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so	999
	preposterous estate as we are.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the	999
	faults I have committed to your worship and to give	999
	me your good report to the prince my master.	999
	999
Shepherd	Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are	999
	gentlemen.	999
	999
Clown	Thou wilt amend thy life?	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	Ay, an it like your good worship.	999
	999
Clown	Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou	999
	art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.	999
	999
Shepherd	You may say it, but not swear it.	999
	999
Clown	Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and	999
	franklins say it, I'll swear it.	999
	999
Shepherd	How if it be false, son?	999
	999
Clown	If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear	999
	it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to	999
	the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and	999
	that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no	999
	tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be	999
	drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst	999
	be a tall fellow of thy hands.	999
	999
AUTOLYCUS	I will prove so, sir, to my power.	999
	999
Clown	Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not	999
	wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not	999
	being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings	999
	and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the	999
	queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy	999
	good masters.	999
	999

	THE WINTER'S TALE	999

	999
ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	A chapel in PAULINA'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA,	999
	CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants]	999
	999
LEONTES	O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort	999
	That I have had of thee!	999
	999
PAULINA	What, sovereign sir,	999
	I did not well I meant well. All my services	999
	You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,	999
	With your crown'd brother and these your contracted	999
	Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,	999
	It is a surplus of your grace, which never	999
	My life may last to answer.	999
	999
LEONTES	O Paulina,	999
	We honour you with trouble: but we came	999
	To see the statue of our queen: your gallery	999
	Have we pass'd through, not without much content	999
	In many singularities; but we saw not	999
	That which my daughter came to look upon,	999
	The statue of her mother.	999
	999
PAULINA	As she lived peerless,	999
	So her dead likeness, I do well believe,	999
	Excels whatever yet you look'd upon	999
	Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it	999
	Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare	999
	To see the life as lively mock'd as ever	999
	Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.	999
	999
	[PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE	999
	standing like a statue]	999
	999
	I like your silence, it the more shows off	999
	Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,	999
	Comes it not something near?	999
	999
LEONTES	Her natural posture!	999
	Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed	999
	Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she	999
	In thy not chiding, for she was as tender	999
	As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,	999
	Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing	999
	So aged as this seems.	999
	999
POLIXENES	O, not by much.	999
	999
PAULINA	So much the more our carver's excellence;	999
	Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her	999
	As she lived now.	999
	999
LEONTES	                  As now she might have done,	999
	So much to my good comfort, as it is	999
	Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,	999
	Even with such life of majesty, warm life,	999
	As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!	999
	I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me	999
	For being more stone than it? O royal piece,	999
	There's magic in thy majesty, which has	999
	My evils conjured to remembrance and	999
	From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,	999
	Standing like stone with thee.	999
	999
PERDITA	And give me leave,	999
	And do not say 'tis superstition, that	999
	I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,	999
	Dear queen, that ended when I but began,	999
	Give me that hand of yours to kiss.	999
	999
PAULINA	O, patience!	999
	The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.	999
	999
CAMILLO	My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,	999
	Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,	999
	So many summers dry; scarce any joy	999
	Did ever so long live; no sorrow	999
	But kill'd itself much sooner.	999
	999
POLIXENES	Dear my brother,	999
	Let him that was the cause of this have power	999
	To take off so much grief from you as he	999
	Will piece up in himself.	999
	999
PAULINA	Indeed, my lord,	999
	If I had thought the sight of my poor image	999
	Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--	999
	I'ld not have show'd it.	999
	999
LEONTES	Do not draw the curtain.	999
	999
PAULINA	No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy	999
	May think anon it moves.	999
	999
LEONTES	Let be, let be.	999
	Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--	999
	What was he that did make it? See, my lord,	999
	Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins	999
	Did verily bear blood?	999
	999
POLIXENES	Masterly done:	999
	The very life seems warm upon her lip.	999
	999
LEONTES	The fixture of her eye has motion in't,	999
	As we are mock'd with art.	999
	999
PAULINA	I'll draw the curtain:	999
	My lord's almost so far transported that	999
	He'll think anon it lives.	999
	999
LEONTES	O sweet Paulina,	999
	Make me to think so twenty years together!	999
	No settled senses of the world can match	999
	The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.	999
	999
PAULINA	I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but	999
	I could afflict you farther.	999
	999
LEONTES	Do, Paulina;	999
	For this affliction has a taste as sweet	999
	As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,	999
	There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel	999
	Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,	999
	For I will kiss her.	999
	999
PAULINA	Good my lord, forbear:	999
	The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;	999
	You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own	999
	With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?	999
	999
LEONTES	No, not these twenty years.	999
	999
PERDITA	So long could I	999
	Stand by, a looker on.	999
	999
PAULINA	Either forbear,	999
	Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you	999
	For more amazement. If you can behold it,	999
	I'll make the statue move indeed, descend	999
	And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--	999
	Which I protest against--I am assisted	999
	By wicked powers.	999
	999
LEONTES	                  What you can make her do,	999
	I am content to look on: what to speak,	999
	I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy	999
	To make her speak as move.	999
	999
PAULINA	It is required	999
	You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;	999
	On: those that think it is unlawful business	999
	I am about, let them depart.	999
	999
LEONTES	Proceed:	999
	No foot shall stir.	999
	999
PAULINA	Music, awake her; strike!	999
	999
	[Music]	999
	999
	'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;	999
	Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,	999
	I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,	999
	Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him	999
	Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:	999
	999
	[HERMIONE comes down]	999
	999
	Start not; her actions shall be holy as	999
	You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her	999
	Until you see her die again; for then	999
	You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:	999
	When she was young you woo'd her; now in age	999
	Is she become the suitor?	999
	999
LEONTES	O, she's warm!	999
	If this be magic, let it be an art	999
	Lawful as eating.	999
	999
POLIXENES	                  She embraces him.	999
	999
CAMILLO	She hangs about his neck:	999
	If she pertain to life let her speak too.	999
	999
POLIXENES	Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,	999
	Or how stolen from the dead.	999
	999
PAULINA	That she is living,	999
	Were it but told you, should be hooted at	999
	Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,	999
	Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.	999
	Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel	999
	And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;	999
	Our Perdita is found.	999
	999
HERMIONE	You gods, look down	999
	And from your sacred vials pour your graces	999
	Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.	999
	Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found	999
	Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,	999
	Knowing by Paulina that the oracle	999
	Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved	999
	Myself to see the issue.	999
	999
PAULINA	There's time enough for that;	999
	Lest they desire upon this push to trouble	999
	Your joys with like relation. Go together,	999
	You precious winners all; your exultation	999
	Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,	999
	Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there	999
	My mate, that's never to be found again,	999
	Lament till I am lost.	999
	999
LEONTES	O, peace, Paulina!	999
	Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,	999
	As I by thine a wife: this is a match,	999
	And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;	999
	But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,	999
	As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many	999
	A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--	999
	For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee	999
	An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,	999
	And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty	999
	Is richly noted and here justified	999
	By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.	999
	What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,	999
	That e'er I put between your holy looks	999
	My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,	999
	And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,	999
	Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,	999
	Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely	999
	Each one demand an answer to his part	999
	Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first	999
	We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	[END]	999
