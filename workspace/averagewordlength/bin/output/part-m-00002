	999
	999
	[Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL	999
	of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others]	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	So shaken as we are, so wan with care,	999
	Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,	999
	And breathe short-winded accents of new broils	999
	To be commenced in strands afar remote.	999
	No more the thirsty entrance of this soil	999
	Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;	999
	Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,	999
	Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs	999
	Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,	999
	Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,	999
	All of one nature, of one substance bred,	999
	Did lately meet in the intestine shock	999
	And furious close of civil butchery	999
	Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,	999
	March all one way and be no more opposed	999
	Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:	999
	The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,	999
	No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,	999
	As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,	999
	Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross	999
	We are impressed and engaged to fight,	999
	Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;	999
	Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb	999
	To chase these pagans in those holy fields	999
	Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet	999
	Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd	999
	For our advantage on the bitter cross.	999
	But this our purpose now is twelve month old,	999
	And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:	999
	Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear	999
	Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,	999
	What yesternight our council did decree	999
	In forwarding this dear expedience.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	My liege, this haste was hot in question,	999
	And many limits of the charge set down	999
	But yesternight: when all athwart there came	999
	A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;	999
	Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,	999
	Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight	999
	Against the irregular and wild Glendower,	999
	Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,	999
	A thousand of his people butchered;	999
	Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,	999
	Such beastly shameless transformation,	999
	By those Welshwomen done as may not be	999
	Without much shame retold or spoken of.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	It seems then that the tidings of this broil	999
	Brake off our business for the Holy Land.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;	999
	For more uneven and unwelcome news	999
	Came from the north and thus it did import:	999
	On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,	999
	Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,	999
	That ever-valiant and approved Scot,	999
	At Holmedon met,	999
	Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,	999
	As by discharge of their artillery,	999
	And shape of likelihood, the news was told;	999
	For he that brought them, in the very heat	999
	And pride of their contention did take horse,	999
	Uncertain of the issue any way.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,	999
	Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.	999
	Stain'd with the variation of each soil	999
	Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;	999
	And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.	999
	The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:	999
	Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,	999
	Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see	999
	On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took	999
	Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son	999
	To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,	999
	Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:	999
	And is not this an honourable spoil?	999
	A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	In faith,	999
	It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin	999
	In envy that my Lord Northumberland	999
	Should be the father to so blest a son,	999
	A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;	999
	Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;	999
	Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:	999
	Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,	999
	See riot and dishonour stain the brow	999
	Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved	999
	That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged	999
	In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,	999
	And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!	999
	Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.	999
	But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,	999
	Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,	999
	Which he in this adventure hath surprised,	999
	To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,	999
	I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,	999
	Malevolent to you in all aspects;	999
	Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up	999
	The crest of youth against your dignity.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	But I have sent for him to answer this;	999
	And for this cause awhile we must neglect	999
	Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.	999
	Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we	999
	Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:	999
	But come yourself with speed to us again;	999
	For more is to be said and to be done	999
	Than out of anger can be uttered.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	I will, my liege.	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	London. An apartment of the Prince's.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack	999
	and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon	999
	benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to	999
	demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.	999
	What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the	999
	day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes	999
	capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the	999
	signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself	999
	a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no	999
	reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand	999
	the time of the day.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take	999
	purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not	999
	by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,	999
	I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God	999
	save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace	999
	thou wilt have none,--	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What, none?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to	999
	prologue to an egg and butter.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not	999
	us that are squires of the night's body be called	999
	thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's	999
	foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the	999
	moon; and let men say we be men of good government,	999
	being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and	999
	chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the	999
	fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and	999
	flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,	999
	by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold	999
	most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most	999
	dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with	999
	swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'	999
	now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder	999
	and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my	999
	hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And	999
	is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and	999
	thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a	999
	buff jerkin?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a	999
	time and oft.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;	999
	and where it would not, I have used my credit.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent	999
	that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet	999
	wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when	999
	thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is	999
	with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do	999
	not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	No; thou shalt.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have	999
	the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my	999
	humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell	999
	you.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	For obtaining of suits?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman	999
	hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy	999
	as a gib cat or a lugged bear.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of	999
	Moor-ditch?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed	999
	the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young	999
	prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more	999
	with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a	999
	commodity of good names were to be bought. An old	999
	lord of the council rated me the other day in the	999
	street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet	999
	he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and	999
	yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the	999
	streets, and no man regards it.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able	999
	to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon	999
	me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew	999
	thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man	999
	should speak truly, little better than one of the	999
	wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give	999
	it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:	999
	I'll be damned for never a king's son in	999
	Christendom.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I	999
	do not, call me villain and baffle me.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying	999
	to purse-taking.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a	999
	man to labour in his vocation.	999
	999
	[Enter POINS]	999
	999
	Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a	999
	match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what	999
	hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the	999
	most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to	999
	a true man.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Good morrow, Ned.	999
	999
POINS	Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?	999
	what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how	999
	agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou	999
	soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira	999
	and a cold capon's leg?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have	999
	his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of	999
	proverbs: he will give the devil his due.	999
	999
POINS	Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.	999
	999
POINS	But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four	999
	o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going	999
	to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders	999
	riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards	999
	for you all; you have horses for yourselves:	999
	Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke	999
	supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it	999
	as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff	999
	your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry	999
	at home and be hanged.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,	999
	I'll hang you for going.	999
	999
POINS	You will, chops?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Hal, wilt thou make one?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good	999
	fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood	999
	royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Why, that's well said.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I care not.	999
	999
POINS	Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:	999
	I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure	999
	that he shall go.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him	999
	the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may	999
	move and what he hears may be believed, that the	999
	true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false	999
	thief; for the poor abuses of the time want	999
	countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!	999
	999
	[Exit Falstaff]	999
	999
POINS	Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us	999
	to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot	999
	manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill	999
	shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:	999
	yourself and I will not be there; and when they	999
	have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut	999
	this head off from my shoulders.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	How shall we part with them in setting forth?	999
	999
POINS	Why, we will set forth before or after them, and	999
	appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at	999
	our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure	999
	upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have	999
	no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our	999
	horses, by our habits and by every other	999
	appointment, to be ourselves.	999
	999
POINS	Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them	999
	in the wood; our vizards we will change after we	999
	leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram	999
	for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.	999
	999
POINS	Well, for two of them, I know them to be as	999
	true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the	999
	third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll	999
	forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the	999
	incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will	999
	tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at	999
	least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what	999
	extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this	999
	lies the jest.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things	999
	necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;	999
	there I'll sup. Farewell.	999
	999
POINS	Farewell, my lord.	999
	999
	[Exit Poins]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I know you all, and will awhile uphold	999
	The unyoked humour of your idleness:	999
	Yet herein will I imitate the sun,	999
	Who doth permit the base contagious clouds	999
	To smother up his beauty from the world,	999
	That, when he please again to be himself,	999
	Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,	999
	By breaking through the foul and ugly mists	999
	Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.	999
	If all the year were playing holidays,	999
	To sport would be as tedious as to work;	999
	But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,	999
	And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.	999
	So, when this loose behavior I throw off	999
	And pay the debt I never promised,	999
	By how much better than my word I am,	999
	By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;	999
	And like bright metal on a sullen ground,	999
	My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,	999
	Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes	999
	Than that which hath no foil to set it off.	999
	I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;	999
	Redeeming time when men think least I will.	999

	[Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR,	999
	SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others]	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	My blood hath been too cold and temperate,	999
	Unapt to stir at these indignities,	999
	And you have found me; for accordingly	999
	You tread upon my patience: but be sure	999
	I will from henceforth rather be myself,	999
	Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;	999
	Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,	999
	And therefore lost that title of respect	999
	Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves	999
	The scourge of greatness to be used on it;	999
	And that same greatness too which our own hands	999

	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord.--	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see	999
	Danger and disobedience in thine eye:	999
	O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,	999
	And majesty might never yet endure	999
	The moody frontier of a servant brow.	999
	You have good leave to leave us: when we need	999
	Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.	999
	999
	[Exit Worcester]	999
	999
	You were about to speak.	999
	999
	[To North]	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Yea, my good lord.	999
	Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,	999
	Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,	999
	Were, as he says, not with such strength denied	999
	As is deliver'd to your majesty:	999
	Either envy, therefore, or misprison	999
	Is guilty of this fault and not my son.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	My liege, I did deny no prisoners.	999
	But I remember, when the fight was done,	999
	When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,	999
	Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,	999
	Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,	999
	Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd	999
	Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;	999
	He was perfumed like a milliner;	999
	And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held	999
	A pouncet-box, which ever and anon	999
	He gave his nose and took't away again;	999
	Who therewith angry, when it next came there,	999
	Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,	999
	And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,	999
	He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,	999
	To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse	999
	Betwixt the wind and his nobility.	999
	With many holiday and lady terms	999
	He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded	999
	My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.	999
	I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,	999
	To be so pester'd with a popinjay,	999
	Out of my grief and my impatience,	999
	Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,	999
	He should or he should not; for he made me mad	999
	To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet	999
	And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman	999
	Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--	999
	And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth	999
	Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;	999
	And that it was great pity, so it was,	999
	This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd	999
	Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,	999
	Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd	999
	So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,	999
	He would himself have been a soldier.	999
	This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,	999
	I answer'd indirectly, as I said;	999
	And I beseech you, let not his report	999
	Come current for an accusation	999
	Betwixt my love and your high majesty.	999
	999
SIR WALTER BLUNT	The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,	999
	Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said	999
	To such a person and in such a place,	999
	At such a time, with all the rest retold,	999
	May reasonably die and never rise	999
	To do him wrong or any way impeach	999
	What then he said, so he unsay it now.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,	999
	But with proviso and exception,	999
	That we at our own charge shall ransom straight	999
	His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;	999
	Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd	999
	The lives of those that he did lead to fight	999
	Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,	999
	Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March	999
	Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,	999
	Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?	999
	Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,	999
	When they have lost and forfeited themselves?	999
	No, on the barren mountains let him starve;	999
	For I shall never hold that man my friend	999
	Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost	999
	To ransom home revolted Mortimer.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Revolted Mortimer!	999
	He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,	999
	But by the chance of war; to prove that true	999
	Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,	999
	Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took	999
	When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,	999
	In single opposition, hand to hand,	999
	He did confound the best part of an hour	999
	In changing hardiment with great Glendower:	999
	Three times they breathed and three times did	999
	they drink,	999
	Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;	999
	Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,	999
	Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,	999
	And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,	999
	Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.	999
	Never did base and rotten policy	999
	Colour her working with such deadly wounds;	999
	Nor could the noble Mortimer	999
	Receive so many, and all willingly:	999
	Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;	999
	He never did encounter with Glendower:	999
	I tell thee,	999
	He durst as well have met the devil alone	999
	As Owen Glendower for an enemy.	999
	Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth	999
	Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:	999
	Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,	999
	Or you shall hear in such a kind from me	999
	As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,	999
	We licence your departure with your son.	999
	Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.	999
	999
	[Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train]	999
	999
HOTSPUR	An if the devil come and roar for them,	999
	I will not send them: I will after straight	999
	And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,	999
	Albeit I make a hazard of my head.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:	999
	Here comes your uncle.	999
	999
	[Re-enter WORCESTER]	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Speak of Mortimer!	999
	'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul	999
	Want mercy, if I do not join with him:	999
	Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,	999
	And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,	999
	But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer	999
	As high in the air as this unthankful king,	999
	As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	Who struck this heat up after I was gone?	999
	999
HOTSPUR	He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;	999
	And when I urged the ransom once again	999
	Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,	999
	And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,	999
	Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd	999
	By Richard that dead is the next of blood?	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	He was; I heard the proclamation:	999
	And then it was when the unhappy king,	999
	--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth	999
	Upon his Irish expedition;	999
	From whence he intercepted did return	999
	To be deposed and shortly murdered.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth	999
	Live scandalized and foully spoken of.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then	999
	Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer	999
	Heir to the crown?	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	He did; myself did hear it.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,	999
	That wished him on the barren mountains starve.	999
	But shall it be that you, that set the crown	999
	Upon the head of this forgetful man	999
	And for his sake wear the detested blot	999
	Of murderous subornation, shall it be,	999
	That you a world of curses undergo,	999
	Being the agents, or base second means,	999
	The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?	999
	O, pardon me that I descend so low,	999
	To show the line and the predicament	999
	Wherein you range under this subtle king;	999
	Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,	999
	Or fill up chronicles in time to come,	999
	That men of your nobility and power	999
	Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,	999
	As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,	999
	To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,	999
	An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?	999
	And shall it in more shame be further spoken,	999
	That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off	999
	By him for whom these shames ye underwent?	999
	No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem	999
	Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves	999
	Into the good thoughts of the world again,	999
	Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt	999
	Of this proud king, who studies day and night	999
	To answer all the debt he owes to you	999
	Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:	999
	Therefore, I say--	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	                  Peace, cousin, say no more:	999
	And now I will unclasp a secret book,	999
	And to your quick-conceiving discontents	999
	I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,	999
	As full of peril and adventurous spirit	999
	As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud	999
	On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:	999
	Send danger from the east unto the west,	999
	So honour cross it from the north to south,	999
	And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs	999
	To rouse a lion than to start a hare!	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Imagination of some great exploit	999
	Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,	999
	To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,	999
	Or dive into the bottom of the deep,	999
	Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,	999
	And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;	999
	So he that doth redeem her thence might wear	999
	Without corrival, all her dignities:	999
	But out upon this half-faced fellowship!	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	He apprehends a world of figures here,	999
	But not the form of what he should attend.	999
	Good cousin, give me audience for a while.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	I cry you mercy.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	                  Those same noble Scots	999
	That are your prisoners,--	999
	999
HOTSPUR	I'll keep them all;	999
	By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;	999
	No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:	999
	I'll keep them, by this hand.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	You start away	999
	And lend no ear unto my purposes.	999
	Those prisoners you shall keep.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Nay, I will; that's flat:	999
	He said he would not ransom Mortimer;	999
	Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;	999
	But I will find him when he lies asleep,	999
	And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'	999
	Nay,	999
	I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak	999
	Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him	999
	To keep his anger still in motion.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	Hear you, cousin; a word.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	All studies here I solemnly defy,	999
	Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:	999
	And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,	999
	But that I think his father loves him not	999
	And would be glad he met with some mischance,	999
	I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you	999
	When you are better temper'd to attend.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool	999
	Art thou to break into this woman's mood,	999
	Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,	999
	Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear	999
	Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.	999
	In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--	999
	A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;	999
	'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,	999
	His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee	999
	Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--	999
	'Sblood!--	999
	When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	At Berkley castle.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	You say true:	999
	Why, what a candy deal of courtesy	999
	This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!	999
	Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'	999
	And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'	999
	O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!	999
	Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	Nay, if you have not, to it again;	999
	We will stay your leisure.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	I have done, i' faith.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.	999
	Deliver them up without their ransom straight,	999
	And make the Douglas' son your only mean	999
	For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons	999
	Which I shall send you written, be assured,	999
	Will easily be granted. You, my lord,	999
	999
	[To Northumberland]	999
	999
	Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,	999
	Shall secretly into the bosom creep	999
	Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,	999
	The archbishop.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Of York, is it not?	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	True; who bears hard	999
	His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.	999
	I speak not this in estimation,	999
	As what I think might be, but what I know	999
	Is ruminated, plotted and set down,	999
	And only stays but to behold the face	999
	Of that occasion that shall bring it on.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;	999
	And then the power of Scotland and of York,	999
	To join with Mortimer, ha?	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	And so they shall.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,	999
	To save our heads by raising of a head;	999
	For, bear ourselves as even as we can,	999
	The king will always think him in our debt,	999
	And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,	999
	Till he hath found a time to pay us home:	999
	And see already how he doth begin	999
	To make us strangers to his looks of love.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	Cousin, farewell: no further go in this	999
	Than I by letters shall direct your course.	999
	When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,	999
	I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;	999
	Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,	999
	As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,	999
	To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,	999
	Which now we hold at much uncertainty.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short	999
	Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!	999

	999
	999
SCENE I	Rochester. An inn yard.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand]	999
	999
First Carrier	Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be	999
	hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and	999
	yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!	999
	999
Ostler	[Within]   Anon, anon.	999
	999
First Carrier	I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks	999
	in the point; poor jade, is wrung in the withers out	999
	of all cess.	999
	999
	[Enter another Carrier]	999
	999
Second Carrier	Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that	999
	is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this	999
	house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.	999
	999
First Carrier	Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats	999
	rose; it was the death of him.	999
	999
Second Carrier	I think this be the most villanous house in all	999
	London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.	999
	999
First Carrier	Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king	999
	christen could be better bit than I have been since	999
	the first cock.	999
	999
Second Carrier	Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we	999
	leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds	999
	fleas like a loach.	999
	999
First Carrier	What, ostler! come away and be hanged!	999
	999
Second Carrier	I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,	999
	to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.	999
	999
First Carrier	God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite	999
	starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou	999
	never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An	999
	'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate	999
	on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!	999
	hast thou no faith in thee?	999
	999
	[Enter GADSHILL]	999
	999
GADSHILL	Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?	999
	999
First Carrier	I think it be two o'clock.	999
	999
GADSHILL	I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding	999
	in the stable.	999
	999
First Carrier	Nay, by God, soft; I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith.	999
	999
GADSHILL	I pray thee, lend me thine.	999
	999
Second Carrier	Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth	999
	he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first.	999
	999
GADSHILL	Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?	999
	999
Second Carrier	Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant	999
	thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the	999
	gentleman: they will along with company, for they	999
	have great charge.	999
	999
	[Exeunt carriers]	999
	999
GADSHILL	What, ho! chamberlain!	999
	999
Chamberlain	[Within]  At hand, quoth pick-purse.	999
	999
GADSHILL	That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the	999
	chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking	999
	of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;	999
	thou layest the plot how.	999
	999
	[Enter Chamberlain]	999
	999
Chamberlain	Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that	999
	I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the	999
	wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with	999
	him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his	999
	company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one	999
	that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.	999
	They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;	999
	they will away presently.	999
	999
GADSHILL	Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'	999
	clerks, I'll give thee this neck.	999
	999
Chamberlain	No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the	999
	hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas	999
	as truly as a man of falsehood may.	999
	999
GADSHILL	What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,	999
	I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old	999
	Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no	999
	starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou	999
	dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are	999
	content to do the profession some grace; that would,	999
	if matters should be looked into, for their own	999
	credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no	999
	foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,	999
	none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;	999
	but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and	999
	great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will	999
	strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than	999
	drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,	999
	I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the	999
	commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey	999
	on her, for they ride up and down on her and make	999
	her their boots.	999
	999
Chamberlain	What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold	999
	out water in foul way?	999
	999
GADSHILL	She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We	999
	steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt	999
	of fern-seed, we walk invisible.	999
	999
Chamberlain	Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to	999
	the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.	999
	999
GADSHILL	Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our	999
	purchase, as I am a true man.	999
	999
Chamberlain	Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.	999
	999
GADSHILL	Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the	999
	ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,	999
	you muddy knave.	999

SCENE II	The highway, near Gadshill.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]	999
	999
POINS	Come, shelter, shelter: I have removed Falstaff's	999
	horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Stand close.	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins!	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Peace, ye fat-kidneyed rascal! what a brawling dost	999
	thou keep!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Where's Poins, Hal?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the	999
	rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know	999
	not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier	999
	further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt	999
	not but to die a fair death for all this, if I	999
	'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have	999
	forsworn his company hourly any time this two and	999
	twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the	999
	rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me	999
	medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it	999
	could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!	999
	Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!	999
	I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere	999
	not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to	999
	leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that	999
	ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven	999
	ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;	999
	and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:	999
	a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!	999
	999
	[They whistle]	999
	999
	Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you	999
	rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close	999
	to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread	999
	of travellers.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?	999
	'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot	999
	again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.	999
	What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?	999
	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,	999
	good king's son.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent	999
	garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I	999
	have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy	999
	tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest	999
	is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.	999
	999
	[Enter GADSHILL, BARDOLPH and PETO]	999
	999
GADSHILL	Stand.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	So I do, against my will.	999
	999
POINS	O, 'tis our setter: I know his voice. Bardolph,	999
	what news?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Case ye, case ye; on with your vizards: there 's	999
	money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going	999
	to the king's exchequer.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.	999
	999
GADSHILL	There's enough to make us all.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	To be hanged.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane;	999
	Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape	999
	from your encounter, then they light on us.	999
	999
PETO	How many be there of them?	999
	999
GADSHILL	Some eight or ten.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Zounds, will they not rob us?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather;	999
	but yet no coward, Hal.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Well, we leave that to the proof.	999
	999
POINS	Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:	999
	when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him.	999
	Farewell, and stand fast.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Ned, where are our disguises?	999
	999
POINS	Here, hard by: stand close.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and POINS]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:	999
	every man to his business.	999
	999
	[Enter the Travellers]	999
	999
First Traveller	Come, neighbour: the boy shall lead our horses down	999
	the hill; we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease our legs.	999
	999
Thieves	Stand!	999
	999
Travellers	Jesus bless us!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:	999
	ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they	999
	hate us youth: down with them: fleece them.	999
	999
Travellers	O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye	999
	fat chuffs: I would your store were here! On,	999
	bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live.	999
	You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith.	999
	999
	[Here they rob them and bind them. Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou	999
	and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it	999
	would be argument for a week, laughter for a month	999
	and a good jest for ever.	999
	999
POINS	Stand close; I hear them coming.	999
	999
	[Enter the Thieves again]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse	999
	before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two	999
	arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's	999
	no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Your money!	999
	999
POINS	Villains!	999
	999
	[As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon	999
	them; they all run away; and Falstaff, after a blow	999
	or two, runs away too, leaving the booty behind them]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:	999
	The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear	999
	So strongly that they dare not meet each other;	999
	Each takes his fellow for an officer.	999
	Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,	999
	And lards the lean earth as he walks along:	999
	Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him.	999
	999
POINS	How the rogue roar'd!	999

SCENE III	Warkworth castle	999
	999
	999
	[Enter HOTSPUR, solus, reading a letter]	999
	999
HOTSPUR	'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well	999
	contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear	999
	your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,	999
	then? In respect of the love he bears our house:	999
	he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than	999
	he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The	999
	purpose you undertake is dangerous;'--why, that's	999
	certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to	999
	drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this	999
	nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The	999
	purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you	999
	have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and	999
	your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so	999
	great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say	999
	unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and	999
	you lie.  What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,	999
	our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our	999
	friends true and constant: a good plot, good	999
	friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,	999
	very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is	999
	this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the	999
	general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by	999
	this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan.	999
	Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord	999
	Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?	999
	is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all	999
	their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the	999
	next month? and are they not some of them set	999
	forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an	999
	infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity	999
	of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay	999
	open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself	999
	and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of	999
	skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!	999
	let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set	999
	forward to-night.	999
	999
	[Enter LADY PERCY]	999
	999
	How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?	999
	For what offence have I this fortnight been	999
	A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?	999
	Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee	999
	Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?	999
	Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,	999
	And start so often when thou sit'st alone?	999
	Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;	999
	And given my treasures and my rights of thee	999
	To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?	999
	In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,	999
	And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;	999
	Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;	999
	Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd	999
	Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,	999
	Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,	999
	Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,	999
	Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,	999
	And all the currents of a heady fight.	999
	Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war	999
	And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,	999
	That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow	999
	Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;	999
	And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,	999
	Such as we see when men restrain their breath	999
	On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?	999
	Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,	999
	And I must know it, else he loves me not.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	What, ho!	999
	999
	[Enter Servant]	999
	999
	Is Gilliams with the packet gone?	999
	999
Servant	He is, my lord, an hour ago.	999
	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?	999
	999
Servant	One horse, my lord, he brought even now.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?	999
	999
Servant	It is, my lord.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	                  That roan shall by my throne.	999
	Well, I will back him straight: O esperance!	999
	Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant]	999
	999
LADY PERCY	But hear you, my lord.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	What say'st thou, my lady?	999
	999
LADY PERCY	What is it carries you away?	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Why, my horse, my love, my horse.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	Out, you mad-headed ape!	999
	A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen	999
	As you are toss'd with. In faith,	999
	I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.	999
	I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir	999
	About his title, and hath sent for you	999
	To line his enterprise: but if you go,--	999
	999
HOTSPUR	So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	Come, come, you paraquito, answer me	999
	Directly unto this question that I ask:	999
	In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,	999
	An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Away,	999
	Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,	999
	I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world	999
	To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:	999
	We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,	999
	And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!	999
	What say'st thou, Kate? what would'st thou	999
	have with me?	999
	999
LADY PERCY	Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?	999
	Well, do not then; for since you love me not,	999
	I will not love myself. Do you not love me?	999
	Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Come, wilt thou see me ride?	999
	And when I am on horseback, I will swear	999
	I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;	999
	I must not have you henceforth question me	999
	Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:	999
	Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,	999
	This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.	999
	I know you wise, but yet no farther wise	999
	Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,	999
	But yet a woman: and for secrecy,	999
	No lady closer; for I well believe	999
	Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;	999
	And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	How! so far?	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:	999
	Whither I go, thither shall you go too;	999
	To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.	999
	Will this content you, Kate?	999
	999
LADY PERCY	It must of force.	999

SCENE IV	The Boar's-Head Tavern, Eastcheap.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me	999
	thy hand to laugh a little.	999
	999
POINS	Where hast been, Hal?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four	999
	score hogsheads. I have sounded the very	999
	base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother	999
	to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by	999
	their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.	999
	They take it already upon their salvation, that	999
	though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king	999
	of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,	999
	like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a	999
	good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I	999
	am king of England, I shall command all the good	999
	lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing	999
	scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they	999
	cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I	999
	am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,	999
	that I can drink with any tinker in his own language	999
	during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost	999
	much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet	999
	action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of	999
	Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped	999
	even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that	999
	never spake other English in his life than 'Eight	999
	shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with	999
	this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint	999
	of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to	999
	drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,	999
	do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my	999
	puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do	999
	thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale	999
	to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and	999
	I'll show thee a precedent.	999
	999

PRINCE HENRY	How long hast thou to serve, Francis?	999
	999
FRANCIS	Forsooth, five years, and as much as to--	999
	999
POINS	[Within]  Francis!	999
	999
FRANCIS	Anon, anon, sir.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Five year! by'r lady, a long lease for the clinking	999
	of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant	999
	as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it	999
	a fair pair of heels and run from it?	999
	999
FRANCIS	O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in	999
	England, I could find in my heart.	999
	999

	999
FRANCIS	Let me see--about Michaelmas next I shall be--	999
	999
POINS	[Within]  Francis!	999
	999
FRANCIS	Anon, sir. Pray stay a little, my lord.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Nay, but hark you, Francis: for the sugar thou	999
	gavest me,'twas a pennyworth, wast't not?	999
	999
FRANCIS	O Lord, I would it had been two!	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me	999
	when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.	999
	999
POINS	[Within]  Francis!	999
	999
FRANCIS	Anon, anon.	999

	or, Francis, o' Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when	999
	thou wilt. But, Francis!	999
	999
FRANCIS	My lord?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Wilt thou rob this leathern jerkin, crystal-button,	999
	not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,	999
	smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,--	999
	999
FRANCIS	O Lord, sir, who do you mean?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink;	999
	for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet	999
	will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much.	999
	999
FRANCIS	What, sir?	999
	999
POINS	[Within]  Francis!	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Away, you rogue! dost thou not hear them call?	999
	999
	[Here they both call him; the drawer stands amazed,	999
	not knowing which way to go]	999
	999
	[Enter Vintner]	999
	999
Vintner	What, standest thou still, and hearest such a	999
	calling? Look to the guests within.	999
	999
	[Exit Francis]	999
	999
	My lord, old Sir John, with half-a-dozen more, are	999
	at the door: shall I let them in?	999
	999

PRINCE HENRY	Sirrah, Falstaff and the rest of the thieves are at	999
	the door: shall we be merry?	999
	999
POINS	As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what	999
	cunning match have you made with this jest of the	999
	drawer? come, what's the issue?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I am now of all humours that have showed themselves	999
	humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the	999
	pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.	999
	999
	[Re-enter FRANCIS]	999
	999
	What's o'clock, Francis?	999
	999
FRANCIS	Anon, anon, sir.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a	999
	parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is	999
	upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of	999
	a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the	999
	Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or	999
	seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his	999
	hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet	999
	life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,	999
	'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan	999
	horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some	999
	fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I	999
	prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and	999
	that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his	999
	wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO;	999
	FRANCIS following with wine]	999
	999
POINS	Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!	999
	marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I	999
	lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend	999
	them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!	999
	Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?	999
	999
	[He drinks]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?	999
	pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale	999
	of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is	999
	nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:	999
	yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime	999
	in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;	999
	die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be	999
	not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a	999
	shotten herring. There live not three good men	999
	unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and	999
	grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.	999
	I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any	999
	thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy	999
	kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy	999
	subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,	999
	I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?	999
	999
POINS	'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the	999
	Lord, I'll stab thee.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call	999
	thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I	999
	could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight	999
	enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your	999
	back: call you that backing of your friends? A	999
	plague upon such backing! give me them that will	999
	face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I	999
	drunk to-day.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou	999
	drunkest last.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	All's one for that.	999
	999
	[He drinks]	999
	999
	A plague of all cowards, still say I.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What's the matter?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What's the matter! there be four of us here have	999
	ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Where is it, Jack? where is it?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon	999
	poor four of us.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What, a hundred, man?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a	999
	dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by	999
	miracle. I am eight times thrust through the	999
	doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut	999
	through and through; my sword hacked like a	999
	hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since	999
	I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all	999
	cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or	999
	less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Speak, sirs; how was it?	999
	999
GADSHILL	We four set upon some dozen--	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Sixteen at least, my lord.	999
	999
GADSHILL	And bound them.	999
	999
PETO	No, no, they were not bound.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I	999
	am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.	999
	999
GADSHILL	As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--	999
	999
FALSTAFF	And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What, fought you with them all?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought	999
	not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if	999
	there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old	999
	Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Pray God you have not murdered some of them.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two	999
	of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues	999
	in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell	999
	thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou	999
	knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my	999
	point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What, four? thou saidst but two even now.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Four, Hal; I told thee four.	999
	999
POINS	Ay, ay, he said four.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at	999
	me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven	999
	points in my target, thus.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Seven? why, there were but four even now.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	In buckram?	999
	999
POINS	Ay, four, in buckram suits.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear me, Hal?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine	999
	in buckram that I told thee of--	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	So, two more already.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Their points being broken,--	999
	999
POINS	Down fell their hose.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,	999
	came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of	999
	the eleven I paid.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten	999
	knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive	999
	at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst	999
	not see thy hand.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	These lies are like their father that begets them;	999
	gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou	999
	clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou	999
	whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth	999
	the truth?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal	999
	green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy	999
	hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?	999
	999
POINS	Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the	999
	strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would	999
	not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on	999
	compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as	999
	blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon	999
	compulsion, I.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine	999
	coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,	999
	this huge hill of flesh,--	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried	999
	neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O	999
	for breath to utter what is like thee! you	999
	tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile	999
	standing-tuck,--	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and	999
	when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,	999
	hear me speak but this.	999
	999
POINS	Mark, Jack.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and	999
	were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain	999
	tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you	999
	four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your	999
	prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in	999
	the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts	999
	away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared	999
	for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard	999
	bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword	999
	as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!	999
	What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst	999
	thou now find out to hide thee from this open and	999
	apparent shame?	999
	999
POINS	Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.	999
	Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the	999
	heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?	999
	why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but	999
	beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true	999
	prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a	999
	coward on instinct. I shall think the better of	999
	myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant	999
	lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,	999
	lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap	999
	to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.	999
	Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles	999
	of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be	999
	merry? shall we have a play extempore?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!	999
	999
	[Enter Hostess]	999
	999
Hostess	O Jesu, my lord the prince!	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to	999
	me?	999
	999
Hostess	Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at	999
	door would speak with you: he says he comes from	999
	your father.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and	999
	send him back again to my mother.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What manner of man is he?	999
	999
Hostess	An old man.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall	999
	I give him his answer?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Prithee, do, Jack.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Faith, and I'll send him packing.	999
	999
	[Exit FALSTAFF]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,	999
	Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you	999
	ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true	999
	prince; no, fie!	999
	999
BARDOLPH	'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's	999
	sword so hacked?	999
	999
PETO	Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would	999
	swear truth out of England but he would make you	999
	believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to	999
	make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments	999
	with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I	999
	did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed	999
	to hear his monstrous devices.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years	999
	ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since	999
	thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and	999
	sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what	999
	instinct hadst thou for it?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold	999
	these exhalations?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I do.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	What think you they portend?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Hot livers and cold purses.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	No, if rightly taken, halter.	999
	999
	[Re-enter FALSTAFF]	999
	999
	Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.	999
	How now, my sweet creature of bombast!	999
	How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was	999
	not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have	999
	crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of	999
	sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a	999
	bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was	999
	Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the	999
	court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the	999
	north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the	999
	bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the	999
	devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh	999
	hook--what a plague call you him?	999
	999
POINS	O, Glendower.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,	999
	and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of	999
	Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill	999
	perpendicular,--	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	He that rides at high speed and with his pistol	999
	kills a sparrow flying.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	You have hit it.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	So did he never the sparrow.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so	999
	for running!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Yes, Jack, upon instinct.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,	999
	and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:	999
	Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's	999
	beard is turned white with the news: you may buy	999
	land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and	999
	this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads	999
	as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we	999
	shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,	999
	art not thou horrible afeard? thou being	999
	heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three	999
	such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that	999
	spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou	999
	not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at	999
	it?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou	999
	comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the	999
	particulars of my life.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,	999
	this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden	999
	sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich	999
	crown for a pitiful bald crown!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,	999
	now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to	999
	make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have	999
	wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it	999
	in King Cambyses' vein.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Well, here is my leg.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.	999
	999
Hostess	O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.	999
	999
Hostess	O, the father, how he holds his countenance!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;	999
	For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.	999
	999
Hostess	O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry	999
	players as ever I see!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.	999
	Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy	999
	time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though	999
	the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster	999
	it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the	999
	sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have	999
	partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,	999
	but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a	999
	foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant	999
	me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;	999
	why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall	999
	the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat	999
	blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall	999
	the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a	999
	question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,	999
	which thou hast often heard of and it is known to	999
	many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,	999
	as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth	999
	the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not	999
	speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in	999
	pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in	999
	woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I	999
	have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What manner of man, an it like your majesty?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a	999
	cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble	999
	carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,	999
	by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I	999
	remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man	999
	should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,	999
	I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be	999
	known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,	999
	peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that	999
	Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell	999
	me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast	999
	thou been this month?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,	999
	and I'll play my father.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so	999
	majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by	999
	the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Well, here I am set.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	And here I stand: judge, my masters.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Now, Harry, whence come you?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My noble lord, from Eastcheap.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle	999
	ye for a young prince, i' faith.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look	999
	on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:	999
	there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an	999
	old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why	999
	dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that	999
	bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel	999
	of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed	999
	cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with	999
	the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that	999
	grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in	999
	years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and	999
	drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a	999
	capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?	999
	wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,	999
	but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I would your grace would take me with you: whom	999
	means your grace?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	That villanous abominable misleader of youth,	999
	Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My lord, the man I know.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I know thou dost.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,	999
	were to say more than I know. That he is old, the	999
	more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but	999
	that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,	999
	that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,	999
	God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a	999
	sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if	999
	to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine	999
	are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,	999
	banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack	999
	Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,	999
	valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,	999
	being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him	999
	thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's	999
	company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I do, I will.	999
	999
	[A knocking heard]	999
	999
	[Exeunt Hostess, FRANCIS, and BARDOLPH]	999
	999
	[Re-enter BARDOLPH, running]	999
	999
BARDOLPH	O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most	999
	monstrous watch is at the door.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to	999
	say in the behalf of that Falstaff.	999
	999
	[Re-enter the Hostess]	999
	999
Hostess	O Jesu, my lord, my lord!	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:	999
	what's the matter?	999
	999
Hostess	The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they	999
	are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of	999
	gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,	999
	without seeming so.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	And thou a natural coward, without instinct.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,	999
	so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart	999
	as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!	999
	I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up	999
	above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good	999
	conscience.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Both which I have had: but their date is out, and	999
	therefore I'll hide me.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Call in the sheriff.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO]	999
	999
	[Enter Sheriff and the Carrier]	999
	999
	Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?	999
	999
Sheriff	First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry	999
	Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What men?	999
	999
Sheriff	One of them is well known, my gracious lord,	999
	A gross fat man.	999
	999
Carrier	                  As fat as butter.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	The man, I do assure you, is not here;	999
	For I myself at this time have employ'd him.	999
	And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee	999
	That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,	999
	Send him to answer thee, or any man,	999
	For any thing he shall be charged withal:	999
	And so let me entreat you leave the house.	999
	999
Sheriff	I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen	999
	Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,	999
	He shall be answerable; and so farewell.	999
	999
Sheriff	Good night, my noble lord.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I think it is good morrow, is it not?	999
	999
Sheriff	Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,	999
	call him forth.	999
	999
PETO	Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and	999
	snorting like a horse.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.	999
	999
	[He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers]	999
	999
	What hast thou found?	999
	999
PETO	Nothing but papers, my lord.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Let's see what they be: read them.	999
	999
PETO	[Reads]  Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d.	999
	Item, Sauce,. . . 4d.	999
	Item, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d.	999
	Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.	999
	Item, Bread,        ob.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to	999
	this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,	999
	keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there	999
	let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the	999
	morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place	999
	shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a	999
	charge of foot; and I know his death will be a	999
	march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid	999
	back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in	999
	the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
PETO	Good morrow, good my lord.	999

	999
ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER]	999
	999
MORTIMER	These promises are fair, the parties sure,	999
	And our induction full of prosperous hope.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,	999
	Will you sit down?	999
	And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!	999
	I have forgot the map.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	No, here it is.	999
	Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,	999
	For by that name as oft as Lancaster	999
	Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with	999
	A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	I cannot blame him: at my nativity	999
	The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,	999
	Of burning cressets; and at my birth	999
	The frame and huge foundation of the earth	999
	Shaked like a coward.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Why, so it would have done at the same season, if	999
	your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself	999
	had never been born.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	I say the earth did shake when I was born.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	And I say the earth was not of my mind,	999
	If you suppose as fearing you it shook.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,	999
	And not in fear of your nativity.	999
	Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth	999
	In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth	999
	Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd	999
	By the imprisoning of unruly wind	999
	Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,	999
	Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down	999
	Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth	999
	Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,	999
	In passion shook.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	                  Cousin, of many men	999
	I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave	999
	To tell you once again that at my birth	999
	The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,	999
	The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds	999
	Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.	999
	These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;	999
	And all the courses of my life do show	999
	I am not in the roll of common men.	999
	Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea	999
	That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,	999
	Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?	999
	And bring him out that is but woman's son	999
	Can trace me in the tedious ways of art	999
	And hold me pace in deep experiments.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.	999
	I'll to dinner.	999
	999
MORTIMER	Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	I can call spirits from the vasty deep.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Why, so can I, or so can any man;	999
	But will they come when you do call for them?	999
	999
GLENDOWER	Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command	999
	The devil.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil	999
	By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.	999
	If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,	999
	And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.	999
	O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!	999
	999
MORTIMER	Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head	999
	Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye	999
	And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him	999
	Bootless home and weather-beaten back.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Home without boots, and in foul weather too!	999
	How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?	999
	999
GLENDOWER	Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right	999
	According to our threefold order ta'en?	999
	999
MORTIMER	The archdeacon hath divided it	999
	Into three limits very equally:	999
	England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,	999
	By south and east is to my part assign'd:	999
	All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,	999
	And all the fertile land within that bound,	999
	To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you	999
	The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.	999
	And our indentures tripartite are drawn;	999
	Which being sealed interchangeably,	999
	A business that this night may execute,	999
	To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I	999
	And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth	999
	To meet your father and the Scottish power,	999
	As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.	999
	My father Glendower is not ready yet,	999
	Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.	999
	Within that space you may have drawn together	999
	Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:	999
	And in my conduct shall your ladies come;	999
	From whom you now must steal and take no leave,	999
	For there will be a world of water shed	999
	Upon the parting of your wives and you.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,	999
	In quantity equals not one of yours:	999
	See how this river comes me cranking in,	999
	And cuts me from the best of all my land	999
	A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.	999
	I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;	999
	And here the smug and silver Trent shall run	999
	In a new channel, fair and evenly;	999
	It shall not wind with such a deep indent,	999
	To rob me of so rich a bottom here.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.	999
	999
MORTIMER	Yea, but	999
	Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up	999
	With like advantage on the other side;	999
	Gelding the opposed continent as much	999
	As on the other side it takes from you.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	Yea, but a little charge will trench him here	999
	And on this north side win this cape of land;	999
	And then he runs straight and even.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	I'll not have it alter'd.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Will not you?	999
	999
GLENDOWER	No, nor you shall not.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Who shall say me nay?	999
	999
GLENDOWER	Why, that will I.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	I can speak English, lord, as well as you;	999
	For I was train'd up in the English court;	999
	Where, being but young, I framed to the harp	999
	Many an English ditty lovely well	999
	And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,	999
	A virtue that was never seen in you.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Marry,	999
	And I am glad of it with all my heart:	999
	I had rather be a kitten and cry mew	999
	Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;	999
	I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,	999
	Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;	999
	And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,	999
	Nothing so much as mincing poetry:	999
	'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land	999
	To any well-deserving friend;	999
	But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,	999
	I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.	999
	Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?	999
	999
GLENDOWER	The moon shines fair; you may away by night:	999
	I'll haste the writer and withal	999
	Break with your wives of your departure hence:	999
	I am afraid my daughter will run mad,	999
	So much she doteth on her Mortimer.	999
	999
	[Exit GLENDOWER]	999
	999
MORTIMER	Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!	999
	999
HOTSPUR	I cannot choose: sometime he angers me	999
	With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,	999
	Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,	999
	And of a dragon and a finless fish,	999
	A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,	999
	A couching lion and a ramping cat,	999
	And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff	999
	As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;	999
	He held me last night at least nine hours	999
	In reckoning up the several devils' names	999
	That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'	999
	But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious	999
	As a tired horse, a railing wife;	999
	Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live	999
	With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,	999
	Than feed on cates and have him talk to me	999
	In any summer-house in Christendom.	999
	999
MORTIMER	In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,	999
	Exceedingly well read, and profited	999
	In strange concealments, valiant as a lion	999
	And as wondrous affable and as bountiful	999
	As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?	999
	He holds your temper in a high respect	999
	And curbs himself even of his natural scope	999
	When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:	999
	I warrant you, that man is not alive	999
	Might so have tempted him as you have done,	999
	Without the taste of danger and reproof:	999
	But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;	999
	And since your coming hither have done enough	999
	To put him quite beside his patience.	999
	You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:	999
	Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--	999
	And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--	999
	Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,	999
	Defect of manners, want of government,	999
	Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:	999
	The least of which haunting a nobleman	999
	Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain	999
	Upon the beauty of all parts besides,	999
	Beguiling them of commendation.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!	999
	Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.	999
	999
	[Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies]	999
	999
MORTIMER	This is the deadly spite that angers me;	999
	My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;	999
	She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.	999
	999
MORTIMER	Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy	999
	Shall follow in your conduct speedily.	999
	999
	[Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she	999
	answers him in the same]	999
	999
GLENDOWER	She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,	999
	one that no persuasion can do good upon.	999
	999
	[The lady speaks in Welsh]	999
	999
MORTIMER	I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh	999
	Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens	999
	I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,	999
	In such a parley should I answer thee.	999
	999
	[The lady speaks again in Welsh]	999
	999
	I understand thy kisses and thou mine,	999
	And that's a feeling disputation:	999
	But I will never be a truant, love,	999
	Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue	999
	Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,	999
	Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,	999
	With ravishing division, to her lute.	999
	999
GLENDOWER	Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.	999
	999
	[The lady speaks again in Welsh]	999
	999
MORTIMER	O, I am ignorance itself in this!	999
	999
GLENDOWER	She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down	999
	And rest your gentle head upon her lap,	999
	And she will sing the song that pleaseth you	999
	And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.	999
	Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,	999
	Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep	999
	As is the difference betwixt day and night	999
	The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team	999
	Begins his golden progress in the east.	999
	999
MORTIMER	With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:	999
	By that time will our book, I think, be drawn	999
	999
GLENDOWER	Do so;	999
	And those musicians that shall play to you	999
	Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,	999
	And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,	999
	quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	Go, ye giddy goose.	999
	999
	[The music plays]	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;	999
	And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.	999
	By'r lady, he is a good musician.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	Then should you be nothing but musical for you are	999
	altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,	999
	and hear the lady sing in Welsh.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	Wouldst thou have thy head broken?	999
	999
HOTSPUR	No.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	Then be still.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Neither;'tis a woman's fault.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	Now God help thee!	999
	999
HOTSPUR	To the Welsh lady's bed.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	What's that?	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Peace! she sings.	999
	999
	[Here the lady sings a Welsh song]	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	Not mine, in good sooth.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a	999
	comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and	999
	'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and	999
	'as sure as day,'	999
	And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,	999
	As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.	999
	Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,	999
	A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'	999
	And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,	999
	To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.	999
	Come, sing.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	I will not sing.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast	999
	teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away	999
	within these two hours; and so, come in when ye will.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
GLENDOWER	Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow	999
	As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.	999
	By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,	999
	And then to horse immediately.	999
	999
MORTIMER	With all my heart.	999

SCENE II	London. The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others]	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I	999
	Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,	999
	For we shall presently have need of you.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Lords]	999
	999
	I know not whether God will have it so,	999
	For some displeasing service I have done,	999
	That, in his secret doom, out of my blood	999
	He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;	999
	But thou dost in thy passages of life	999
	Make me believe that thou art only mark'd	999
	For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven	999
	To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,	999
	Could such inordinate and low desires,	999
	Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,	999
	Such barren pleasures, rude society,	999
	As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,	999
	Accompany the greatness of thy blood	999
	And hold their level with thy princely heart?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	So please your majesty, I would I could	999
	Quit all offences with as clear excuse	999
	As well as I am doubtless I can purge	999
	Myself of many I am charged withal:	999
	Yet such extenuation let me beg,	999
	As, in reproof of many tales devised,	999
	which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,	999
	By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,	999
	I may, for some things true, wherein my youth	999
	Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,	999
	Find pardon on my true submission.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,	999
	At thy affections, which do hold a wing	999
	Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.	999
	Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.	999
	Which by thy younger brother is supplied,	999
	And art almost an alien to the hearts	999
	Of all the court and princes of my blood:	999
	The hope and expectation of thy time	999
	Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man	999
	Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.	999
	Had I so lavish of my presence been,	999
	So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,	999
	So stale and cheap to vulgar company,	999
	Opinion, that did help me to the crown,	999
	Had still kept loyal to possession	999
	And left me in reputeless banishment,	999
	A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.	999
	By being seldom seen, I could not stir	999
	But like a comet I was wonder'd at;	999
	That men would tell their children 'This is he;'	999
	Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'	999
	And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,	999
	And dress'd myself in such humility	999
	That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,	999
	Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,	999
	Even in the presence of the crowned king.	999
	Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;	999
	My presence, like a robe pontifical,	999
	Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,	999
	Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast	999
	And won by rareness such solemnity.	999
	The skipping king, he ambled up and down	999
	With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,	999
	Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,	999
	Mingled his royalty with capering fools,	999
	Had his great name profaned with their scorns	999
	And gave his countenance, against his name,	999
	To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push	999
	Of every beardless vain comparative,	999
	Grew a companion to the common streets,	999
	Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;	999
	That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,	999
	They surfeited with honey and began	999
	To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little	999
	More than a little is by much too much.	999
	So when he had occasion to be seen,	999
	He was but as the cuckoo is in June,	999
	Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes	999
	As, sick and blunted with community,	999
	Afford no extraordinary gaze,	999
	Such as is bent on sun-like majesty	999
	When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;	999
	But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,	999
	Slept in his face and render'd such aspect	999
	As cloudy men use to their adversaries,	999
	Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.	999
	And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;	999
	For thou has lost thy princely privilege	999
	With vile participation: not an eye	999
	But is a-weary of thy common sight,	999
	Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;	999
	Which now doth that I would not have it do,	999
	Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,	999
	Be more myself.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	                  For all the world	999
	As thou art to this hour was Richard then	999
	When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,	999
	And even as I was then is Percy now.	999
	Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,	999
	He hath more worthy interest to the state	999
	Than thou the shadow of succession;	999
	For of no right, nor colour like to right,	999
	He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,	999
	Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,	999
	And, being no more in debt to years than thou,	999
	Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on	999
	To bloody battles and to bruising arms.	999
	What never-dying honour hath he got	999
	Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,	999
	Whose hot incursions and great name in arms	999
	Holds from all soldiers chief majority	999
	And military title capital	999
	Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:	999
	Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,	999
	This infant warrior, in his enterprises	999
	Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,	999
	Enlarged him and made a friend of him,	999
	To fill the mouth of deep defiance up	999
	And shake the peace and safety of our throne.	999
	And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,	999
	The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,	999
	Capitulate against us and are up.	999
	But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?	999
	Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,	999
	Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?	999
	Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,	999
	Base inclination and the start of spleen	999
	To fight against me under Percy's pay,	999
	To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,	999
	To show how much thou art degenerate.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Do not think so; you shall not find it so:	999
	And God forgive them that so much have sway'd	999
	Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!	999
	I will redeem all this on Percy's head	999
	And in the closing of some glorious day	999
	Be bold to tell you that I am your son;	999
	When I will wear a garment all of blood	999
	And stain my favours in a bloody mask,	999
	Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:	999
	And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,	999
	That this same child of honour and renown,	999
	This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,	999
	And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.	999
	For every honour sitting on his helm,	999
	Would they were multitudes, and on my head	999
	My shames redoubled! for the time will come,	999
	That I shall make this northern youth exchange	999
	His glorious deeds for my indignities.	999
	Percy is but my factor, good my lord,	999
	To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;	999
	And I will call him to so strict account,	999
	That he shall render every glory up,	999
	Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,	999
	Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.	999
	This, in the name of God, I promise here:	999
	The which if He be pleased I shall perform,	999
	I do beseech your majesty may salve	999
	The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:	999
	If not, the end of life cancels all bands;	999
	And I will die a hundred thousand deaths	999
	Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	A hundred thousand rebels die in this:	999
	Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.	999
	999
	[Enter BLUNT]	999
	999
	How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.	999
	999
SIR WALTER BLUNT	So hath the business that I come to speak of.	999
	Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word	999
	That Douglas and the English rebels met	999
	The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury	999
	A mighty and a fearful head they are,	999
	If promises be kept on every hand,	999
	As ever offer'd foul play in the state.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;	999
	With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;	999
	For this advertisement is five days old:	999
	On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;	999
	On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting	999
	Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march	999
	Through Gloucestershire; by which account,	999
	Our business valued, some twelve days hence	999
	Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.	999
	Our hands are full of business: let's away;	999
	Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last	999
	action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my	999
	skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose	999
	gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,	999
	I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some	999
	liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I	999
	shall have no strength to repent. An I have not	999
	forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I	999
	am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a	999
	church! Company, villanous company, hath been the	999
	spoil of me.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make	999
	me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman	999
	need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not	999
	above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once	999
	in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I	999
	borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in	999
	good compass: and now I live out of all order, out	999
	of all compass.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs	999
	be out of all compass, out of all reasonable	999
	compass, Sir John.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:	999
	thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in	999
	the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the	999
	Knight of the Burning Lamp.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many	999
	a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I	999
	never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and	999
	Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his	999
	robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way	999
	given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath	999
	should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but	999
	thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but	999
	for the light in thy face, the son of utter	999
	darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the	999
	night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou	999
	hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,	999
	there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a	999
	perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!	999
	Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and	999
	torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt	999
	tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast	999
	drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap	999
	at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have	999
	maintained that salamander of yours with fire any	999
	time this two and thirty years; God reward me for	999
	it!	999
	999
BARDOLPH	'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.	999
	999
	[Enter Hostess]	999
	999
	How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired	999
	yet who picked my pocket?	999
	999
Hostess	Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you	999
	think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,	999
	I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy	999
	by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair	999
	was never lost in my house before.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many	999
	a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go	999
	to, you are a woman, go.	999
	999
Hostess	Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never	999
	called so in mine own house before.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Go to, I know you well enough.	999
	999
Hostess	No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know	999
	you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now	999
	you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought	999
	you a dozen of shirts to your back.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to	999
	bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.	999
	999
Hostess	Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight	999
	shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir	999
	John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent	999
	you, four and twenty pound.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	He had his part of it; let him pay.	999
	999
Hostess	He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?	999
	let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:	999
	Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker	999
	of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I	999
	shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a	999
	seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.	999
	999
Hostess	O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not	999
	how oft, that ring was copper!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an	999
	he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he	999
	would say so.	999
	999
	[Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF	999
	meets them playing on his truncheon like a life]	999
	999
	How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?	999
	must we all march?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.	999
	999
Hostess	My lord, I pray you, hear me.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy	999
	husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.	999
	999
Hostess	Good my lord, hear me.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What sayest thou, Jack?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras	999
	and had my pocket picked: this house is turned	999
	bawdy-house; they pick pockets.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What didst thou lose, Jack?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of	999
	forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my	999
	grandfather's.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	A trifle, some eight-penny matter.	999
	999
Hostess	So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your	999
	grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely	999
	of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said	999
	he would cudgel you.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What! he did not?	999
	999
Hostess	There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed	999
	prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn	999
	fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the	999
	deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,	999
	go	999
	999
Hostess	Say, what thing? what thing?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.	999
	999
Hostess	I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou	999
	shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,	999
	setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to	999
	call me so.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say	999
	otherwise.	999
	999
Hostess	Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What beast! why, an otter.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not	999
	where to have her.	999
	999
Hostess	Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any	999
	man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.	999
	999
Hostess	So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you	999
	ought him a thousand pound.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth	999
	a million: thou owest me thy love.	999
	999
Hostess	Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would	999
	cudgel you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Did I, Bardolph?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Indeed, Sir John, you said so.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Yea, if he said my ring was copper.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:	999
	but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the	999
	roaring of a lion's whelp.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	And why not as the lion?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou	999
	think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an	999
	I do, I pray God my girdle break.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy	999
	knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,	999
	truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all	999
	filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest	999
	woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,	999
	impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in	999
	thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of	999
	bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of	999
	sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket	999
	were enriched with any other injuries but these, I	999
	am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will	999
	not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of	999
	innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack	999
	Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I	999
	have more flesh than another man, and therefore more	999
	frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	It appears so by the story.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;	999
	love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy	999
	guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest	999
	reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,	999
	prithee, be gone.	999
	999
	[Exit Hostess]	999
	999
	Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,	999
	lad, how is that answered?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to	999
	thee: the money is paid back again.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and	999
	do it with unwashed hands too.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Do, my lord.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find	999
	one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the	999
	age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am	999
	heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for	999
	these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I	999
	laud them, I praise them.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Bardolph!	999
	999
BARDOLPH	My lord?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my	999
	brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.	999
	999
	[Exit Bardolph]	999
	999
	Go, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou and I have	999
	thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.	999
	999
	[Exit Peto]	999
	999
	Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two	999
	o'clock in the afternoon.	999
	There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive	999
	Money and order for their furniture.	999
	The land is burning; Percy stands on high;	999
	And either we or they must lower lie.	999
	999
	[Exit PRINCE HENRY]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!	999
	O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!	999
	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, and DOUGLAS]	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth	999
	In this fine age were not thought flattery,	999
	Such attribution should the Douglas have,	999
	As not a soldier of this season's stamp	999
	Should go so general current through the world.	999
	By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy	999
	The tongues of soothers; but a braver place	999
	In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:	999
	Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	Thou art the king of honour:	999
	No man so potent breathes upon the ground	999
	But I will beard him.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Do so, and 'tis well.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger with letters]	999
	999
	What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.	999
	999
Messenger	These letters come from your father.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Letters from him! why comes he not himself?	999
	999
Messenger	He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick	999
	In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?	999
	Under whose government come they along?	999
	999
Messenger	His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?	999
	999
Messenger	He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;	999
	And at the time of my departure thence	999
	He was much fear'd by his physicians.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	I would the state of time had first been whole	999
	Ere he by sickness had been visited:	999
	His health was never better worth than now.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect	999
	The very life-blood of our enterprise;	999
	'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.	999
	He writes me here, that inward sickness--	999
	And that his friends by deputation could not	999
	So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet	999
	To lay so dangerous and dear a trust	999
	On any soul removed but on his own.	999
	Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,	999
	That with our small conjunction we should on,	999
	To see how fortune is disposed to us;	999
	For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.	999
	Because the king is certainly possess'd	999
	Of all our purposes. What say you to it?	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	Your father's sickness is a maim to us.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:	999
	And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want	999
	Seems more than we shall find it: were it good	999
	To set the exact wealth of all our states	999
	All at one cast? to set so rich a main	999
	On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?	999
	It were not good; for therein should we read	999
	The very bottom and the soul of hope,	999
	The very list, the very utmost bound	999
	Of all our fortunes.	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	'Faith, and so we should;	999
	Where now remains a sweet reversion:	999
	We may boldly spend upon the hope of what	999
	Is to come in:	999
	A comfort of retirement lives in this.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.	999
	If that the devil and mischance look big	999
	Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	But yet I would your father had been here.	999
	The quality and hair of our attempt	999
	Brooks no division: it will be thought	999
	By some, that know not why he is away,	999
	That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike	999
	Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:	999
	And think how such an apprehension	999
	May turn the tide of fearful faction	999
	And breed a kind of question in our cause;	999
	For well you know we of the offering side	999
	Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,	999
	And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence	999
	The eye of reason may pry in upon us:	999
	This absence of your father's draws a curtain,	999
	That shows the ignorant a kind of fear	999
	Before not dreamt of.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	You strain too far.	999
	I rather of his absence make this use:	999
	It lends a lustre and more great opinion,	999
	A larger dare to our great enterprise,	999
	Than if the earl were here; for men must think,	999
	If we without his help can make a head	999
	To push against a kingdom, with his help	999
	We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.	999
	Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	As heart can think: there is not such a word	999
	Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON]	999
	999
HOTSPUR	My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.	999
	999
VERNON	Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.	999
	The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,	999
	Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	No harm: what more?	999
	999
VERNON	And further, I have learn'd,	999
	The king himself in person is set forth,	999
	Or hitherwards intended speedily,	999
	With strong and mighty preparation.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,	999
	The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,	999
	And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,	999
	And bid it pass?	999
	999
VERNON	                  All furnish'd, all in arms;	999
	All plumed like estridges that with the wind	999
	Baited like eagles having lately bathed;	999
	Glittering in golden coats, like images;	999
	As full of spirit as the month of May,	999
	And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;	999
	Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.	999
	I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,	999
	His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd	999
	Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,	999
	And vaulted with such ease into his seat,	999
	As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,	999
	To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus	999
	And witch the world with noble horsemanship.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,	999
	This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:	999
	They come like sacrifices in their trim,	999
	And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war	999
	All hot and bleeding will we offer them:	999
	The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit	999
	Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire	999
	To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh	999
	And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,	999
	Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt	999
	Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:	999
	Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,	999
	Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.	999
	O that Glendower were come!	999
	999
VERNON	There is more news:	999
	I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,	999
	He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.	999
	999
WORCESTER	Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	What may the king's whole battle reach unto?	999
	999
VERNON	To thirty thousand.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Forty let it be:	999
	My father and Glendower being both away,	999
	The powers of us may serve so great a day	999
	Come, let us take a muster speedily:	999
	Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	Talk not of dying: I am out of fear	999
	Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.	999

	999
BARDOLPH	Will you give me money, captain?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Lay out, lay out.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	This bottle makes an angel.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it make	999
	twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid	999

	999
BARDOLPH	I will, captain: farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused	999
	gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.	999
	I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty	999
	soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me	999
	none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire	999
	me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked	999
	twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,	999
	as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as	999
	fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck	999
	fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such	999
	toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no	999
	bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out	999
	their services; and now my whole charge consists of	999
	ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of	999
	companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the	999
	painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his	999
	sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but	999
	discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to	999
	younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers	999
	trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a	999
	long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than	999
	an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up	999
	the rooms of them that have bought out their	999
	services, that you would think that I had a hundred	999
	and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from	999
	swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad	999
	fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded	999
	all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye	999
	hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through	999
	Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the	999
	villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had	999
	gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of	999
	prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my	999
	company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked	999
	together and thrown over the shoulders like an	999
	herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say	999
	the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or	999
	the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all	999
	one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.	999

FALSTAFF	What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou	999
	in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I	999
	cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been	999
	at Shrewsbury.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were	999
	there, and you too; but my powers are there already.	999
	The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must	999
	away all night.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to	999
	steal cream.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath	999
	already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose	999
	fellows are these that come after?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Mine, Hal, mine.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I did never see such pitiful rascals.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food	999
	for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:	999
	tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor	999
	and bare, too beggarly.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had	999
	that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never	999
	learned that of me.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on	999
	the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is	999
	already in the field.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What, is the king encamped?	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.	999

VERNON	So do we.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	        His is certain, ours is doubtful.	999

VERNON	Do not, my lord.	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	                  You do not counsel well:	999

VERNON	Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,	999
	And I dare well maintain it with my life,	999
	If well-respected honour bid me on,	999
	I hold as little counsel with weak fear	999
	As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:	999
	Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle	999

	Being men of such great leading as you are,	999
	That you foresee not what impediments	999
	Drag back our expedition: certain horse	999
	Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:	999
	Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;	999
	And now their pride and mettle is asleep,	999
	Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,	999
	That not a horse is half the half of himself.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	So are the horses of the enemy	999
	In general, journey-bated and brought low:	999
	The better part of ours are full of rest.	999

	999
SIR WALTER BLUNT	I come with gracious offers from the king,	999
	if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God	999
	You were of our determination!	999
	Some of us love you well; and even those some	999
	Envy your great deservings and good name,	999
	Because you are not of our quality,	999
	But stand against us like an enemy.	999
	999
SIR WALTER BLUNT	And God defend but still I should stand so,	999
	So long as out of limit and true rule	999
	You stand against anointed majesty.	999
	But to my charge. The king hath sent to know	999
	The nature of your griefs, and whereupon	999
	You conjure from the breast of civil peace	999
	Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land	999
	Audacious cruelty. If that the king	999
	Have any way your good deserts forgot,	999
	Which he confesseth to be manifold,	999
	He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed	999
	You shall have your desires with interest	999
	And pardon absolute for yourself and these	999
	Herein misled by your suggestion.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	The king is kind; and well we know the king	999
	Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.	999
	My father and my uncle and myself	999
	Did give him that same royalty he wears;	999
	And when he was not six and twenty strong,	999
	Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,	999
	A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,	999
	My father gave him welcome to the shore;	999
	And when he heard him swear and vow to God	999
	He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,	999
	To sue his livery and beg his peace,	999
	With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,	999
	My father, in kind heart and pity moved,	999
	Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.	999
	Now when the lords and barons of the realm	999
	Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,	999
	The more and less came in with cap and knee;	999
	Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,	999
	Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,	999
	Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,	999
	Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him	999
	Even at the heels in golden multitudes.	999
	He presently, as greatness knows itself,	999
	Steps me a little higher than his vow	999
	Made to my father, while his blood was poor,	999
	Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;	999
	And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform	999
	Some certain edicts and some strait decrees	999
	That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,	999
	Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep	999
	Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,	999
	This seeming brow of justice, did he win	999
	The hearts of all that he did angle for;	999
	Proceeded further; cut me off the heads	999
	Of all the favourites that the absent king	999
	In deputation left behind him here,	999
	When he was personal in the Irish war.	999
	999
SIR WALTER BLUNT	Tut, I came not to hear this.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Then to the point.	999
	In short time after, he deposed the king;	999
	Soon after that, deprived him of his life;	999
	And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:	999
	To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,	999
	Who is, if every owner were well placed,	999
	Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,	999
	There without ransom to lie forfeited;	999
	Disgraced me in my happy victories,	999
	Sought to entrap me by intelligence;	999
	Rated mine uncle from the council-board;	999
	In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;	999
	Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,	999
	And in conclusion drove us to seek out	999
	This head of safety; and withal to pry	999
	Into his title, the which we find	999
	Too indirect for long continuance.	999
	999
SIR WALTER BLUNT	Shall I return this answer to the king?	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.	999
	Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd	999
	Some surety for a safe return again,	999
	And in the morning early shall my uncle	999
	Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.	999
	999
SIR WALTER BLUNT	I would you would accept of grace and love.	999

	999
SIR MICHAEL	My good lord,	999
	I guess their tenor.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Like enough you do.	999
	To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day	999
	Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men	999
	Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,	999
	As I am truly given to understand,	999
	The king with mighty and quick-raised power	999
	Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,	999
	What with the sickness of Northumberland,	999
	Whose power was in the first proportion,	999
	And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,	999
	Who with them was a rated sinew too	999
	And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,	999
	I fear the power of Percy is too weak	999
	To wage an instant trial with the king.	999
	999
SIR MICHAEL	Why, my good lord, you need not fear;	999
	There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	No, Mortimer is not there.	999
	999
SIR MICHAEL	But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,	999
	And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head	999
	Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn	999

	The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,	999
	The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;	999
	And moe corrivals and dear men	999
	Of estimation and command in arms.	999
	999
SIR MICHAEL	Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;	999
	And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:	999
	For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king	999
	Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,	999
	For he hath heard of our confederacy,	999
	And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:	999

	Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,	999
	And by his hollow whistling in the leaves	999
	Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Then with the losers let it sympathize,	999
	For nothing can seem foul to those that win.	999
	999
	[The trumpet sounds]	999
	999
	[Enter WORCESTER and VERNON]	999
	999
	How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well	999
	That you and I should meet upon such terms	999
	As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,	999
	And made us doff our easy robes of peace,	999
	To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:	999
	This is not well, my lord, this is not well.	999
	What say you to it? will you again unknit	999
	This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?	999
	And move in that obedient orb again	999
	Where you did give a fair and natural light,	999
	And be no more an exhaled meteor,	999
	A prodigy of fear and a portent	999
	Of broached mischief to the unborn times?	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	Hear me, my liege:	999
	For mine own part, I could be well content	999
	To entertain the lag-end of my life	999
	With quiet hours; for I do protest,	999
	I have not sought the day of this dislike.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	You have not sought it! how comes it, then?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Peace, chewet, peace!	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	It pleased your majesty to turn your looks	999
	Of favour from myself and all our house;	999
	And yet I must remember you, my lord,	999
	We were the first and dearest of your friends.	999
	For you my staff of office did I break	999
	In Richard's time; and posted day and night	999
	to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,	999
	When yet you were in place and in account	999
	Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.	999
	It was myself, my brother and his son,	999
	That brought you home and boldly did outdare	999
	The dangers of the time. You swore to us,	999
	And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,	999
	That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;	999
	Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,	999
	The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:	999
	To this we swore our aid. But in short space	999
	It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;	999
	And such a flood of greatness fell on you,	999
	What with our help, what with the absent king,	999
	What with the injuries of a wanton time,	999
	The seeming sufferances that you had borne,	999
	And the contrarious winds that held the king	999
	So long in his unlucky Irish wars	999
	That all in England did repute him dead:	999
	And from this swarm of fair advantages	999
	You took occasion to be quickly woo'd	999
	To gripe the general sway into your hand;	999
	Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;	999
	And being fed by us you used us so	999
	As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,	999
	Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;	999
	Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk	999
	That even our love durst not come near your sight	999
	For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing	999
	We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly	999
	Out of sight and raise this present head;	999
	Whereby we stand opposed by such means	999
	As you yourself have forged against yourself	999
	By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,	999
	And violation of all faith and troth	999
	Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	These things indeed you have articulate,	999
	Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,	999
	To face the garment of rebellion	999
	With some fine colour that may please the eye	999
	Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,	999
	Which gape and rub the elbow at the news	999
	Of hurlyburly innovation:	999
	And never yet did insurrection want	999
	Such water-colours to impaint his cause;	999
	Nor moody beggars, starving for a time	999
	Of pellmell havoc and confusion.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	In both your armies there is many a soul	999
	Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,	999
	If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,	999
	The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world	999
	In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,	999
	This present enterprise set off his head,	999
	I do not think a braver gentleman,	999
	More active-valiant or more valiant-young,	999
	More daring or more bold, is now alive	999
	To grace this latter age with noble deeds.	999
	For my part, I may speak it to my shame,	999
	I have a truant been to chivalry;	999
	And so I hear he doth account me too;	999
	Yet this before my father's majesty--	999
	I am content that he shall take the odds	999
	Of his great name and estimation,	999
	And will, to save the blood on either side,	999
	Try fortune with him in a single fight.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,	999
	Albeit considerations infinite	999
	Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,	999
	We love our people well; even those we love	999
	That are misled upon your cousin's part;	999
	And, will they take the offer of our grace,	999
	Both he and they and you, every man	999
	Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:	999
	So tell your cousin, and bring me word	999
	What he will do: but if he will not yield,	999
	Rebuke and dread correction wait on us	999
	And they shall do their office. So, be gone;	999
	We will not now be troubled with reply:	999
	We offer fair; take it advisedly.	999
	999
	[Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	It will not be accepted, on my life:	999
	The Douglas and the Hotspur both together	999
	Are confident against the world in arms.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;	999
	For, on their answer, will we set on them:	999
	And God befriend us, as our cause is just!	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride	999
	me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.	999
	Say thy prayers, and farewell.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I  would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Why, thou owest God a death.	999
	999
	[Exit PRINCE HENRY]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before	999
	his day. What need I be so forward with him that	999
	calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks	999
	me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I	999
	come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or	999
	an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.	999
	Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is	999
	honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what	999
	is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?	999
	he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.	999
	Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,	999
	to the dead. But will it not live with the living?	999
	no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore	999
	I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so	999
	ends my catechism.	999

	[Enter WORCESTER and VERNON]	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,	999
	The liberal and kind offer of the king.	999
	999
VERNON	'Twere best he did.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	Then are we all undone.	999
	It is not possible, it cannot be,	999
	The king should keep his word in loving us;	999
	He will suspect us still and find a time	999
	To punish this offence in other faults:	999
	Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;	999
	For treason is but trusted like the fox,	999
	Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,	999
	Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.	999
	Look how we can, or sad or merrily,	999
	Interpretation will misquote our looks,	999
	And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,	999
	The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.	999
	My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;	999
	it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,	999
	And an adopted name of privilege,	999
	A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:	999
	All his offences live upon my head	999
	And on his father's; we did train him on,	999
	And, his corruption being ta'en from us,	999
	We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.	999
	Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,	999
	In any case, the offer of the king.	999
	999
VERNON	Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.	999
	Here comes your cousin.	999
	999
	[Enter HOTSPUR and DOUGLAS]	999
	999
HOTSPUR	My uncle is return'd:	999
	Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.	999
	Uncle, what news?	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	The king will bid you battle presently.	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	Marry, and shall, and very willingly.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	There is no seeming mercy in the king.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Did you beg any? God forbid!	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	I told him gently of our grievances,	999
	Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,	999
	By now forswearing that he is forsworn:	999
	He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge	999
	With haughty arms this hateful name in us.	999
	999
	[Re-enter the EARL OF DOUGLAS]	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	Arm, gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown	999
	A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,	999
	And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it;	999
	Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,	999
	And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,	999
	And that no man might draw short breath today	999
	But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,	999
	How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?	999
	999
VERNON	No, by my soul; I never in my life	999
	Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,	999
	Unless a brother should a brother dare	999
	To gentle exercise and proof of arms.	999
	He gave you all the duties of a man;	999
	Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,	999
	Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,	999
	Making you ever better than his praise	999
	By still dispraising praise valued in you;	999
	And, which became him like a prince indeed,	999
	He made a blushing cital of himself;	999
	And chid his truant youth with such a grace	999
	As if he master'd there a double spirit.	999
	Of teaching and of learning instantly.	999
	There did he pause: but let me tell the world,	999
	If he outlive the envy of this day,	999
	England did never owe so sweet a hope,	999
	So much misconstrued in his wantonness.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Cousin, I think thou art enamoured	999
	On his follies: never did I hear	999
	Of any prince so wild a libertine.	999
	But be he as he will, yet once ere night	999
	I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,	999
	That he shall shrink under my courtesy.	999
	Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,	999
	Better consider what you have to do	999
	Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,	999
	Can lift your blood up with persuasion.	999

	999
Messenger	My lord, here are letters for you.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	I cannot read them now.	999
	O gentlemen, the time of life is short!	999
	To spend that shortness basely were too long,	999
	If life did ride upon a dial's point,	999
	Still ending at the arrival of an hour.	999
	An if we live, we live to tread on kings;	999
	If die, brave death, when princes die with us!	999
	Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,	999
	When the intent of bearing them is just.	999
	999

	999
Messenger	My lord, prepare; the king comes on apace.	999

HOTSPUR	I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,	999
	For I profess not talking; only this--	999
	Let each man do his best: and here draw I	999
	A sword, whose temper I intend to stain	999
	With the best blood that I can meet withal	999
	In the adventure of this perilous day.	999
	Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.	999
	Sound all the lofty instruments of war,	999
	And by that music let us all embrace;	999

	999
SIR WALTER BLUNT	What is thy name, that in the battle thus	999
	Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek	999
	Upon my head?	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	                  Know then, my name is Douglas;	999
	And I do haunt thee in the battle thus	999
	Because some tell me that thou art a king.	999
	999
SIR WALTER BLUNT	They tell thee true.	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought	999
	Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,	999
	This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,	999
	Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.	999
	999
SIR WALTER BLUNT	I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;	999
	And thou shalt find a king that will revenge	999
	Lord Stafford's death.	999
	999
	[They fight. DOUGLAS kills SIR WALTER BLUNT.	999

HOTSPUR	O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,	999
	never had triumph'd upon a Scot.	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the king.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Where?	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	Here.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well:	999
	A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;	999
	Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!	999
	A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:	999
	Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?	999
	999
HOTSPUR	The king hath many marching in his coats.	999
	999
EARL OF DOUGLAS	Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;	999
	I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,	999
	Until I meet the king.	999

	Soft! who are you? Sir Walter Blunt: there's honour	999
	for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten	999
	lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I	999
	need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have	999
	led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's	999
	not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and	999
	they are for the town's end, to beg during life.	999
	But who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter PRINCE HENRY]	999

	Many a nobleman lies stark and stiff	999
	Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,	999
	Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,	999
	lend me thy sword.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.	999
	Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have	999
	done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	He is, indeed; and living to kill thee. I prithee,	999
	lend me thy sword.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st	999
	not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.	999
	999

	come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his	999
	willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like	999
	not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me	999

	999
KING HENRY IV	The king himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart	999
	So many of his shadows thou hast met	999
	And not the very king. I have two boys	999
	Seek Percy and thyself about the field:	999
	But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,	999
	I will assay thee: so, defend thyself.	999
	999

	The insulting hand of Douglas over you,	999
	Which would have been as speedy in your end	999
	As all the poisonous potions in the world	999
	And saved the treacherous labour of your son.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter HOTSPUR]	999
	999
HOTSPUR	If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	My name is Harry Percy.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Why, then I see	999
	A very valiant rebel of the name.	999
	I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,	999
	To share with me in glory any more:	999
	Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;	999
	Nor can one England brook a double reign,	999
	Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come	999
	To end the one of us; and would to God	999
	Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;	999
	And all the budding honours on thy crest	999
	I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.	999
	999
HOTSPUR	I can no longer brook thy vanities.	999
	999
	[They fight]	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no	999
	boy's play here, I can tell you.	999
	999
	[Re-enter DOUGLAS; he fights with FALSTAFF,	999
	who falls down as if he were dead, and exit	999
	DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls]	999
	999
HOTSPUR	O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!	999
	I better brook the loss of brittle life	999
	Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;	999
	They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:	999
	But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;	999
	And time, that takes survey of all the world,	999
	Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,	999
	But that the earthy and cold hand of death	999
	Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust	999
	And food for--	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!	999
	Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!	999
	When that this body did contain a spirit,	999
	A kingdom for it was too small a bound;	999
	But now two paces of the vilest earth	999
	Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead	999
	Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.	999
	If thou wert sensible of courtesy,	999
	I should not make so dear a show of zeal:	999
	But let my favours hide thy mangled face;	999
	And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself	999
	For doing these fair rites of tenderness.	999
	Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!	999
	Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,	999
	But not remember'd in thy epitaph!	999
	999
	[He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground]	999
	999
	What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh	999
	Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!	999
	I could have better spared a better man:	999
	O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,	999
	If I were much in love with vanity!	999
	Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,	999
	Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.	999
	Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:	999
	Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.	999
	999
	[Exit PRINCE HENRY]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	[Rising up]  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,	999
	I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too	999
	to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or	999
	that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.	999
	Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,	999
	is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the	999
	counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:	999
	but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby	999
	liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and	999
	perfect image of life indeed. The better part of	999
	valour is discretion; in the which better part I	999
	have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this	999
	gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he	999
	should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am	999
	afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.	999
	Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I	999
	killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?	999
	Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.	999
	Therefore, sirrah,	999
	999
	[Stabbing him]	999
	999
	with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.	999
	999
	[Takes up HOTSPUR on his back]	999
	999
	[Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd	999
	Thy maiden sword.	999
	999
LANCASTER	                  But, soft! whom have we here?	999
	Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I did; I saw him dead,	999
	Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art	999
	thou alive?	999
	Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?	999
	I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes	999
	Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I	999
	be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:	999
	999
	[Throwing the body down]	999
	999
	if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let	999
	him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either	999
	earl or duke, I can assure you.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to	999
	lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;	999
	and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and	999
	fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be	999
	believed, so; if not, let them that should reward	999
	valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take	999
	it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the	999
	thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,	999
	'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.	999
	999
LANCASTER	This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	This is the strangest fellow, brother John.	999
	Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:	999
	For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,	999
	I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.	999
	999
	[A retreat is sounded]	999
	999
	The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.	999
	Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,	999
	To see what friends are living, who are dead.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that	999
	rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,	999
	I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and	999
	live cleanly as a nobleman should do.	999

	[The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE	999
	HENRY, LORD JOHN LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND,	999
	with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners]	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.	999
	Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,	999
	Pardon and terms of love to all of you?	999
	And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?	999
	Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?	999
	Three knights upon our party slain to-day,	999
	A noble earl and many a creature else	999
	Had been alive this hour,	999
	If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne	999
	Betwixt our armies true intelligence.	999
	999
EARL OF WORCESTER	What I have done my safety urged me to;	999
	And I embrace this fortune patiently,	999
	Since not to be avoided it falls on me.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:	999
	Other offenders we will pause upon.	999
	999
	[Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, guarded]	999
	999
	How goes the field?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw	999
	The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,	999
	The noble Percy slain, and all his men	999
	Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;	999
	And falling from a hill, he was so bruised	999
	That the pursuers took him. At my tent	999
	The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace	999
	I may dispose of him.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	With all my heart.	999
	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you	999
	This honourable bounty shall belong:	999
	Go to the Douglas, and deliver him	999
	Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:	999
	His valour shown upon our crests to-day	999
	Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds	999
	Even in the bosom of our adversaries.	999
	999
LANCASTER	I thank your grace for this high courtesy,	999
	Which I shall give away immediately.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Then this remains, that we divide our power.	999
	You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland	999
	Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,	999
	To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,	999
	Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:	999
	Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,	999
	To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.	999
	Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,	999
	Meeting the cheque of such another day:	999
	And since this business so fair is done,	999
	Let us not leave till all our own be won.	999

	999
	[Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the	999
	Fifth, attended on by Dukes of BEDFORD, Regent of	999
	France; GLOUCESTER, Protector; and EXETER, Earl of	999
	WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, Heralds, &c]	999
	999
BEDFORD	Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!	999
	Comets, importing change of times and states,	999
	Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,	999
	And with them scourge the bad revolting stars	999
	That have consented unto Henry's death!	999
	King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!	999
	England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	England ne'er had a king until his time.	999
	Virtue he had, deserving to command:	999
	His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:	999
	His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;	999
	His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,	999
	More dazzled and drove back his enemies	999
	Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.	999
	What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:	999
	He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.	999
	999
EXETER	We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?	999
	Henry is dead and never shall revive:	999
	Upon a wooden coffin we attend,	999
	And death's dishonourable victory	999
	We with our stately presence glorify,	999
	Like captives bound to a triumphant car.	999
	What! shall we curse the planets of mishap	999
	That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?	999
	Or shall we think the subtle-witted French	999
	Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him	999
	By magic verses have contrived his end?	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.	999
	Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day	999
	So dreadful will not be as was his sight.	999
	The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:	999
	The church's prayers made him so prosperous.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,	999
	His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:	999
	None do you like but an effeminate prince,	999
	Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector	999
	And lookest to command the prince and realm.	999
	Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,	999
	More than God or religious churchmen may.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,	999
	And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st	999
	Except it be to pray against thy foes.	999
	999
BEDFORD	Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:	999
	Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:	999
	Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:	999
	Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.	999
	Posterity, await for wretched years,	999
	When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,	999
	Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,	999
	And none but women left to wail the dead.	999
	Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:	999
	Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,	999
	Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!	999
	A far more glorious star thy soul will make	999
	Than Julius Caesar or bright--	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	My honourable lords, health to you all!	999
	Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,	999
	Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:	999
	Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,	999
	Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.	999
	999
BEDFORD	What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?	999
	Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns	999
	Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?	999
	If Henry were recall'd to life again,	999
	These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.	999
	999
EXETER	How were they lost? what treachery was used?	999
	999
Messenger	No treachery; but want of men and money.	999
	Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,	999
	That here you maintain several factions,	999
	And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,	999
	You are disputing of your generals:	999
	One would have lingering wars with little cost;	999
	Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;	999
	A third thinks, without expense at all,	999
	By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.	999
	Awake, awake, English nobility!	999
	Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:	999
	Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;	999
	Of England's coat one half is cut away.	999
	999
EXETER	Were our tears wanting to this funeral,	999
	These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.	999
	999
BEDFORD	Me they concern; Regent I am of France.	999
	Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.	999
	Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!	999
	Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,	999
	To weep their intermissive miseries.	999
	999
	[Enter to them another Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.	999
	France is revolted from the English quite,	999
	Except some petty towns of no import:	999
	The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;	999
	The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;	999
	Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;	999
	The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.	999
	999
EXETER	The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!	999
	O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.	999
	Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.	999
	999
BEDFORD	Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?	999
	An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,	999
	Wherewith already France is overrun.	999
	999
	[Enter another Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	My gracious lords, to add to your laments,	999
	Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,	999
	I must inform you of a dismal fight	999
	Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?	999
	999
Messenger	O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:	999
	The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.	999
	The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,	999
	Retiring from the siege of Orleans,	999
	Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.	999
	By three and twenty thousand of the French	999
	Was round encompassed and set upon.	999
	No leisure had he to enrank his men;	999
	He wanted pikes to set before his archers;	999
	Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges	999
	They pitched in the ground confusedly,	999
	To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.	999
	More than three hours the fight continued;	999
	Where valiant Talbot above human thought	999
	Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:	999
	Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;	999
	Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:	999
	The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;	999
	All the whole army stood agazed on him:	999
	His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit	999
	A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain	999
	And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.	999
	Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,	999
	If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:	999
	He, being in the vaward, placed behind	999
	With purpose to relieve and follow them,	999
	Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.	999
	Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;	999
	Enclosed were they with their enemies:	999
	A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,	999
	Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,	999
	Whom all France with their chief assembled strength	999
	Durst not presume to look once in the face.	999
	999
BEDFORD	Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,	999
	For living idly here in pomp and ease,	999
	Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,	999
	Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.	999
	999
Messenger	O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,	999
	And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:	999
	Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.	999
	999
BEDFORD	His ransom there is none but I shall pay:	999
	I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:	999
	His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;	999
	Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.	999
	Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;	999
	Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,	999
	To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:	999
	Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,	999
	Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.	999
	999
Messenger	So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;	999
	The English army is grown weak and faint:	999
	The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,	999
	And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,	999
	Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.	999
	999
EXETER	Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,	999
	Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,	999
	Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.	999
	999
BEDFORD	I do remember it; and here take my leave,	999
	To go about my preparation.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,	999
	To view the artillery and munition;	999
	And then I will proclaim young Henry king.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
EXETER	To Eltham will I, where the young king is,	999
	Being ordain'd his special governor,	999
	And for his safety there I'll best devise.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Each hath his place and function to attend:	999
	I am left out; for me nothing remains.	999
	But long I will not be Jack out of office:	999
	The king from Eltham I intend to steal	999
	And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	France. Before Orleans.	999
	999
	999
	[Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and	999
	REIGNIER, marching with drum and Soldiers]	999
	999
CHARLES	Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens	999
	So in the earth, to this day is not known:	999
	Late did he shine upon the English side;	999
	Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.	999
	What towns of any moment but we have?	999
	At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;	999
	Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,	999
	Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.	999
	999
ALENCON	They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:	999
	Either they must be dieted like mules	999
	And have their provender tied to their mouths	999
	Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.	999
	999
REIGNIER	Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?	999
	Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:	999
	Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury;	999
	And he may well in fretting spend his gall,	999
	Nor men nor money hath he to make war.	999
	999
CHARLES	Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.	999
	Now for the honour of the forlorn French!	999
	Him I forgive my death that killeth me	999
	When he sees me go back one foot or fly.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Here alarum; they are beaten back by the English	999
	with great loss. Re-enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER]	999
	999
CHARLES	Who ever saw the like? what men have I!	999
	Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,	999
	But that they left me 'midst my enemies.	999
	999
REIGNIER	Salisbury is a desperate homicide;	999
	He fighteth as one weary of his life.	999
	The other lords, like lions wanting food,	999
	Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.	999
	999
ALENCON	Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,	999
	England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,	999
	During the time Edward the Third did reign.	999
	More truly now may this be verified;	999
	For none but Samsons and Goliases	999
	It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!	999
	Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose	999
	They had such courage and audacity?	999
	999
CHARLES	Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,	999
	And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:	999
	Of old I know them; rather with their teeth	999
	The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.	999
	999
REIGNIER	I think, by some odd gimmors or device	999
	Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on;	999
	Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.	999
	By my consent, we'll even let them alone.	999
	999
ALENCON	Be it so.	999
	999
	[Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS]	999
	999
BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.	999
	999
CHARLES	Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.	999
	999
BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:	999
	Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?	999
	Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand:	999
	A holy maid hither with me I bring,	999
	Which by a vision sent to her from heaven	999
	Ordained is to raise this tedious siege	999
	And drive the English forth the bounds of France.	999
	The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,	999
	Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:	999
	What's past and what's to come she can descry.	999
	Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,	999
	For they are certain and unfallible.	999
	999
CHARLES	Go, call her in.	999
	999
	[Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS]	999
	999
	But first, to try her skill,	999
	Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:	999
	Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:	999
	By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.	999
	999
	[Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, with JOAN LA PUCELLE]	999
	999
REIGNIER	Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?	999
	Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;	999
	I know thee well, though never seen before.	999
	Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me:	999
	In private will I talk with thee apart.	999
	Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.	999
	999
REIGNIER	She takes upon her bravely at first dash.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,	999
	My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.	999
	Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased	999
	To shine on my contemptible estate:	999
	Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,	999
	And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,	999
	God's mother deigned to appear to me	999
	And in a vision full of majesty	999
	Will'd me to leave my base vocation	999
	And free my country from calamity:	999
	Her aid she promised and assured success:	999
	In complete glory she reveal'd herself;	999
	And, whereas I was black and swart before,	999
	With those clear rays which she infused on me	999
	That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.	999
	Ask me what question thou canst possible,	999
	And I will answer unpremeditated:	999
	My courage try by combat, if thou darest,	999
	And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.	999
	Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,	999
	If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.	999
	999
CHARLES	Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:	999
	Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,	999
	In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,	999
	And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;	999
	Otherwise I renounce all confidence.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,	999
	Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side;	999
	The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's	999
	churchyard,	999
	Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.	999
	999
CHARLES	Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man.	999
	999
	[Here they fight, and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes]	999
	999
CHARLES	Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon	999
	And fightest with the sword of Deborah.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.	999
	999
CHARLES	Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:	999
	Impatiently I burn with thy desire;	999
	My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.	999
	Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,	999
	Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:	999
	'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	I must not yield to any rites of love,	999
	For my profession's sacred from above:	999
	When I have chased all thy foes from hence,	999
	Then will I think upon a recompense.	999
	999
CHARLES	Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.	999
	999
REIGNIER	My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.	999
	999
ALENCON	Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;	999
	Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.	999
	999
REIGNIER	Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?	999
	999
ALENCON	He may mean more than we poor men do know:	999
	These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.	999
	999
REIGNIER	My lord, where are you? what devise you on?	999
	Shall we give over Orleans, or no?	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!	999
	Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.	999
	999
CHARLES	What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.	999
	This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:	999
	Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,	999
	Since I have entered into these wars.	999
	Glory is like a circle in the water,	999
	Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself	999
	Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.	999
	With Henry's death the English circle ends;	999
	Dispersed are the glories it included.	999
	Now am I like that proud insulting ship	999
	Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.	999
	999
CHARLES	Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?	999
	Thou with an eagle art inspired then.	999
	Helen, the mother of great Constantine,	999
	Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee.	999
	Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,	999
	How may I reverently worship thee enough?	999
	999
ALENCON	Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.	999
	999
REIGNIER	Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;	999
	Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.	999
	999
CHARLES	Presently we'll try: come, let's away about it:	999
	No prophet will I trust, if she prove false.	999

	999
	999
SCENE III	London. Before the Tower.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER, with his Serving-men in blue coats]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I am come to survey the Tower this day:	999
	Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance.	999
	Where be these warders, that they wait not here?	999
	Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.	999
	999
First Warder	[Within]  Who's there that knocks so imperiously?	999
	999
First Serving-Man	It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.	999
	999
Second Warder	[Within]  Whoe'er he be, you may not be let in.	999
	999
First Serving-Man	Villains, answer you so the lord protector?	999
	999
First Warder	[Within]  The Lord protect him! so we answer him:	999
	We do no otherwise than we are will'd.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?	999
	There's none protector of the realm but I.	999
	Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize.	999
	Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?	999
	999
	[Gloucester's men rush at the Tower Gates, and	999
	WOODVILE the Lieutenant speaks within]	999
	999
WOODVILE	What noise is this? what traitors have we here?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?	999
	Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter.	999
	999
WOODVILE	Have patience, noble duke; I may not open;	999
	The Cardinal of Winchester forbids:	999
	From him I have express commandment	999
	That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?	999
	Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,	999
	Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?	999
	Thou art no friend to God or to the king:	999
	Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly.	999
	999
Serving-Men	Open the gates unto the lord protector,	999
	Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.	999
	999
	[Enter to the Protector at the Tower Gates BISHOP	999
	OF WINCHESTER and his men in tawny coats]	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	I do, thou most usurping proditor,	999
	And not protector, of the king or realm.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,	999
	Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord;	999
	Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:	999
	I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,	999
	If thou proceed in this thy insolence.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot:	999
	This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain,	999
	To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back:	999
	Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth	999
	I'll use to carry thee out of this place.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What! am I dared and bearded to my face?	999
	Draw, men, for all this privileged place;	999
	Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard,	999
	I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly:	999
	Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat:	999
	In spite of pope or dignities of church,	999
	Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!	999
	Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?	999
	Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.	999
	Out, tawny coats! out, scarlet hypocrite!	999
	999
	[Here GLOUCESTER's men beat out BISHOP OF	999
	WINCHESTER's men, and enter in the hurly-	999
	burly the Mayor of London and his Officers]	999
	999
Mayor	Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,	999
	Thus contumeliously should break the peace!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:	999
	Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,	999
	Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,	999
	One that still motions war and never peace,	999
	O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,	999
	That seeks to overthrow religion,	999
	Because he is protector of the realm,	999
	And would have armour here out of the Tower,	999
	To crown himself king and suppress the prince.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I will not answer thee with words, but blows.	999
	999
	[Here they skirmish again]	999
	999
Mayor	Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife	999
	But to make open proclamation:	999
	Come, officer; as loud as e'er thou canst,	999
	Cry.	999
	999
Officer	All manner of men assembled here in arms this day	999
	against God's peace and the king's, we charge and	999
	command you, in his highness' name, to repair to	999
	your several dwelling-places; and not to wear,	999
	handle, or use any sword, weapon, or dagger,	999
	henceforward, upon pain of death.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law:	999
	But we shall meet, and break our minds at large.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Gloucester, we will meet; to thy cost, be sure:	999
	Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.	999
	999
Mayor	I'll call for clubs, if you will not away.	999
	This cardinal's more haughty than the devil.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head;	999
	For I intend to have it ere long.	999
	999
	[Exeunt, severally, GLOUCESTER and BISHOP OF	999
	WINCHESTER with their Serving-men]	999
	999
Mayor	See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.	999
	Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!	999

SCENE IV	Orleans.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter, on the walls, a Master Gunner and his Boy]	999
	999
Master-Gunner	Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged,	999
	And how the English have the suburbs won.	999
	999
Boy	Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,	999
	Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.	999
	999
Master-Gunner	But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:	999
	Chief master-gunner am I of this town;	999
	Something I must do to procure me grace.	999
	The prince's espials have informed me	999
	How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,	999
	Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars	999
	In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,	999
	And thence discover how with most advantage	999
	They may vex us with shot, or with assault.	999
	To intercept this inconvenience,	999
	A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed;	999
	And even these three days have I watch'd,	999
	If I could see them.	999
	Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer.	999
	If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;	999
	And thou shalt find me at the governor's.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
Boy	Father, I warrant you; take you no care;	999
	I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter, on the turrets, SALISBURY and TALBOT,	999
	GLANSDALE, GARGRAVE, and others]	999
	999
SALISBURY	Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!	999
	How wert thou handled being prisoner?	999
	Or by what means got'st thou to be released?	999
	Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.	999
	999
TALBOT	The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner	999
	Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;	999
	For him was I exchanged and ransomed.	999
	But with a baser man of arms by far	999
	Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:	999
	Which I, disdaining, scorn'd; and craved death,	999
	Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.	999
	In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired.	999
	But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,	999
	Whom with my bare fists I would execute,	999
	If I now had him brought into my power.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.	999
	999
TALBOT	With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.	999
	In open market-place produced they me,	999
	To be a public spectacle to all:	999
	Here, said they, is the terror of the French,	999
	The scarecrow that affrights our children so.	999
	Then broke I from the officers that led me,	999
	And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,	999
	To hurl at the beholders of my shame:	999
	My grisly countenance made others fly;	999
	None durst come near for fear of sudden death.	999
	In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;	999
	So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,	999
	That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,	999
	And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:	999
	Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,	999
	That walked about me every minute-while;	999
	And if I did but stir out of my bed,	999
	Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.	999
	999
	[Enter the Boy with a linstock]	999
	999
SALISBURY	I grieve to hear what torments you endured,	999
	But we will be revenged sufficiently	999
	Now it is supper-time in Orleans:	999
	Here, through this grate, I count each one	999
	and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:	999
	Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.	999
	Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,	999
	Let me have your express opinions	999
	Where is best place to make our battery next.	999
	999
GARGRAVE	I think, at the north gate; for there stand lords.	999
	999
GLANSDALE	And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.	999
	999
TALBOT	For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,	999
	Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.	999
	999
	[Here they shoot. SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall]	999
	999
SALISBURY	O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!	999
	999
GARGRAVE	O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!	999
	999
TALBOT	What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?	999
	Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:	999
	How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?	999
	One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!	999
	Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand	999
	That hath contrived this woful tragedy!	999
	In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;	999
	Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;	999
	Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,	999
	His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.	999
	Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,	999
	One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:	999
	The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.	999
	Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,	999
	If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!	999
	Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.	999
	Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?	999
	Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.	999
	Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;	999
	Thou shalt not die whiles--	999
	He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.	999
	As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,	999
	Remember to avenge me on the French.'	999
	Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,	999
	Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:	999
	Wretched shall France be only in my name.	999
	999
	[Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens]	999
	999
	What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?	999
	Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head:	999
	The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,	999
	A holy prophetess new risen up,	999
	Is come with a great power to raise the siege.	999
	999
	[Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans]	999
	999
TALBOT	Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!	999
	It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.	999
	Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:	999
	Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,	999
	Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,	999
	And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.	999
	Convey me Salisbury into his tent,	999
	And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.	999

	after them then re-enter TALBOT]	999
	999
TALBOT	Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?	999
	Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them:	999
	A woman clad in armour chaseth them.	999
	999
	[Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE]	999
	999
	Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee;	999
	Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee:	999
	Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,	999
	And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace thee.	999
	999
	[Here they fight]	999

TALBOT	Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?	999
	My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage	999
	And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder.	999
	But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.	999
	999
	[They fight again]	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Talbot, farewell; thy hour is not yet come:	999
	I must go victual Orleans forthwith.	999
	999
	[A short alarum; then enter the town with soldiers]	999
	999
	O'ertake me, if thou canst; I scorn thy strength.	999
	Go, go, cheer up thy hungry-starved men;	999
	Help Salisbury to make his testament:	999
	This day is ours, as many more shall be.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
TALBOT	My thoughts are whirled like a potter's wheel;	999
	I know not where I am, nor what I do;	999
	A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,	999
	Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists:	999
	So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench	999
	Are from their hives and houses driven away.	999
	They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs;	999
	Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.	999
	999
	[A short alarum]	999
	999
	Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,	999
	Or tear the lions out of England's coat;	999
	Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:	999
	Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,	999
	Or horse or oxen from the leopard,	999
	As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.	999

	999
	It will not be: retire into your trenches:	999

	For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.	999
	Pucelle is enter'd into Orleans,	999
	In spite of us or aught that we could do.	999

	Thus Joan la Pucelle hath perform'd her word.	999
	999
CHARLES	Divinest creature, Astraea's daughter,	999
	How shall I honour thee for this success?	999
	Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens	999
	That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.	999

	For which I will divide my crown with her,	999
	And all the priests and friars in my realm	999

	A statelier pyramis to her I'll rear	999

	scaling-ladders, their drums beating a dead march]	999
	999
TALBOT	Lord Regent, and redoubted Burgundy,	999
	By whose approach the regions of Artois,	999
	Wallon and Picardy are friends to us,	999
	This happy night the Frenchmen are secure,	999
	Having all day caroused and banqueted:	999
	Embrace we then this opportunity	999
	As fitting best to quittance their deceit	999
	Contrived by art and baleful sorcery.	999
	999
BEDFORD	Coward of France! how much he wrongs his fame,	999
	Despairing of his own arm's fortitude,	999
	To join with witches and the help of hell!	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Traitors have never other company.	999
	But what's that Pucelle whom they term so pure?	999
	999
TALBOT	A maid, they say.	999
	999
BEDFORD	                  A maid! and be so martial!	999

BURGUNDY	Pray God she prove not masculine ere long,	999
	If underneath the standard of the French	999
	She carry armour as she hath begun.	999
	999
TALBOT	Well, let them practise and converse with spirits:	999
	God is our fortress, in whose conquering name	999
	Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.	999
	999
BEDFORD	Ascend, brave Talbot; we will follow thee.	999
	999
TALBOT	Not all together: better far, I guess,	999
	That we do make our entrance several ways;	999
	That, if it chance the one of us do fail,	999
	The other yet may rise against their force.	999
	999
BEDFORD	Agreed: I'll to yond corner.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	And I to this.	999
	999
TALBOT	And here will Talbot mount, or make his grave.	999
	Now, Salisbury, for thee, and for the right	999
	Of English Henry, shall this night appear	999
	How much in duty I am bound to both.	999
	999
Sentinels	Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!	999
	999
	[Cry: 'St. George,' 'A Talbot.']	999

	[The French leap over the walls in their shirts.	999

	ALENCON, and REIGNIER, half ready, and half unready]	999
	999
ALENCON	How now, my lords! what, all unready so?	999
	999
BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.	999
	999
REIGNIER	'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,	999
	Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.	999
	999
ALENCON	Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,	999
	Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise	999
	More venturous or desperate than this.	999
	999
BASTARD OF ORLEANS	I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.	999
	999
REIGNIER	If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him.	999
	999
ALENCON	Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.	999
	999
BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.	999
	999
	[Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE]	999
	999
CHARLES	Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?	999
	Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,	999
	Make us partakers of a little gain,	999
	That now our loss might be ten times so much?	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!	999
	At all times will you have my power alike?	999
	Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,	999
	Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?	999
	Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,	999
	This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.	999
	999
CHARLES	Duke of Alencon, this was your default,	999
	That, being captain of the watch to-night,	999
	Did look no better to that weighty charge.	999
	999
ALENCON	Had all your quarters been as safely kept	999
	As that whereof I had the government,	999
	We had not been thus shamefully surprised.	999
	999
BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Mine was secure.	999
	999
REIGNIER	                  And so was mine, my lord.	999
	999
CHARLES	And, for myself, most part of all this night,	999
	Within her quarter and mine own precinct	999
	I was employ'd in passing to and fro,	999
	About relieving of the sentinels:	999
	Then how or which way should they first break in?	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Question, my lords, no further of the case,	999
	How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place	999
	But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.	999
	And now there rests no other shift but this;	999
	To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,	999
	And lay new platforms to endamage them.	999
	999
	[Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying 'A	999
	Talbot! a Talbot!' They fly, leaving their	999
	clothes behind]	999
	999
Soldier	I'll be so bold to take what they have left.	999
	The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;	999

	999
TALBOT	Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,	999
	And here advance it in the market-place,	999
	The middle centre of this cursed town.	999
	Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;	999
	For every drop of blood was drawn from him,	999
	There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.	999
	And that hereafter ages may behold	999
	What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,	999
	Within their chiefest temple I'll erect	999
	A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd:	999
	Upon the which, that every one may read,	999
	Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,	999
	The treacherous manner of his mournful death	999
	And what a terror he had been to France.	999
	But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,	999
	I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,	999
	His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,	999
	Nor any of his false confederates.	999
	999
BEDFORD	'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,	999
	Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,	999
	They did amongst the troops of armed men	999
	Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Myself, as far as I could well discern	999
	For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,	999
	Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,	999
	When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,	999
	Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves	999
	That could not live asunder day or night.	999

	Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts	999
	So much applauded through the realm of France?	999
	999
TALBOT	Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?	999
	999
Messenger	The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,	999
	With modesty admiring thy renown,	999
	By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe	999
	To visit her poor castle where she lies,	999
	That she may boast she hath beheld the man	999
	Whose glory fills the world with loud report.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars	999
	Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,	999
	When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.	999
	You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.	999
	999
TALBOT	Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men	999
	Could not prevail with all their oratory,	999
	Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:	999
	And therefore tell her I return great thanks,	999
	And in submission will attend on her.	999
	Will not your honours bear me company?	999
	999
BEDFORD	No, truly; it is more than manners will:	999
	And I have heard it said, unbidden guests	999
	Are often welcomest when they are gone.	999
	999
TALBOT	Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,	999

	Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad	999
	That with his name the mothers still their babes?	999
	I see report is fabulous and false:	999
	I thought I should have seen some Hercules,	999

	And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.	999
	Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!	999

	Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,	999
	For in my gallery thy picture hangs:	999
	But now the substance shall endure the like,	999
	And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,	999
	That hast by tyranny these many years	999
	Wasted our country, slain our citizens	999
	And sent our sons and husbands captivate.	999
	999

	Whereon to practise your severity.	999
	999
COUNTESS	999
OF AUVERGNE	Why, art not thou the man?	999
	999
TALBOT	I am indeed.	999
	999
COUNTESS	999
OF AUVERGNE	Then have I substance too.	999
	999
TALBOT	No, no, I am but shadow of myself:	999
	You are deceived, my substance is not here;	999
	For what you see is but the smallest part	999
	And least proportion of humanity:	999
	I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,	999
	It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,	999
	Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.	999
	999
COUNTESS	999
OF AUVERGNE	This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;	999
	He will be here, and yet he is not here:	999
	How can these contrarieties agree?	999
	999
TALBOT	That will I show you presently.	999
	999
	[Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of	999
	ordnance. Enter soldiers]	999
	999
	How say you, madam? are you now persuaded	999
	That Talbot is but shadow of himself?	999
	These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,	999
	With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,	999
	Razeth your cities and subverts your towns	999
	And in a moment makes them desolate.	999
	999
COUNTESS	999
OF AUVERGNE	Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:	999
	I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited	999
	And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.	999
	Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;	999
	For I am sorry that with reverence	999
	I did not entertain thee as thou art.	999
	999
TALBOT	Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconstrue	999
	The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake	999
	The outward composition of his body.	999
	What you have done hath not offended me;	999
	Nor other satisfaction do I crave,	999
	But only, with your patience, that we may	999
	Taste of your wine and see what cates you have;	999
	For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.	999
	999
COUNTESS	999
OF AUVERGNE	With all my heart, and think me honoured	999
	To feast so great a warrior in my house.	999

	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
SCENE IV	London. The Temple-garden.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the Earls of SOMERSET, SUFFOLK, and WARWICK;	999
	RICHARD PLANTAGENET, VERNON, and another Lawyer]	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?	999
	Dare no man answer in a case of truth?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Within the Temple-hall we were too loud;	999
	The garden here is more convenient.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;	999
	Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Faith, I have been a truant in the law,	999
	And never yet could frame my will to it;	999
	And therefore frame the law unto my will.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.	999
	999
WARWICK	Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;	999
	Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;	999
	Between two blades, which bears the better temper:	999
	Between two horses, which doth bear him best;	999
	Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye;	999
	I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;	999
	But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,	999
	Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:	999
	The truth appears so naked on my side	999
	That any purblind eye may find it out.	999
	999
SOMERSET	And on my side it is so well apparell'd,	999
	So clear, so shining and so evident	999
	That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,	999
	In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:	999
	Let him that is a true-born gentleman	999
	And stands upon the honour of his birth,	999
	If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,	999
	From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,	999
	But dare maintain the party of the truth,	999
	Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.	999
	999
WARWICK	I love no colours, and without all colour	999
	Of base insinuating flattery	999
	I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	I pluck this red rose with young Somerset	999
	And say withal I think he held the right.	999
	999
VERNON	Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,	999
	Till you conclude that he upon whose side	999
	The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree	999
	Shall yield the other in the right opinion.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:	999
	If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	And I.	999
	999
VERNON	Then for the truth and plainness of the case.	999
	I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,	999
	Giving my verdict on the white rose side.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,	999
	Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red	999
	And fall on my side so, against your will.	999
	999
VERNON	If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,	999
	Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt	999
	And keep me on the side where still I am.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Well, well, come on: who else?	999
	999
Lawyer	Unless my study and my books be false,	999
	The argument you held was wrong in you:	999
	999
	[To SOMERSET]	999
	999
	In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Now, Somerset, where is your argument?	999
	999
SOMERSET	Here in my scabbard, meditating that	999
	Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;	999
	For pale they look with fear, as witnessing	999
	The truth on our side.	999
	999
SOMERSET	No, Plantagenet,	999
	'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks	999
	Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,	999
	And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?	999
	999
SOMERSET	Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;	999
	Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,	999
	That shall maintain what I have said is true,	999
	Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,	999
	I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Away, away, good William de la Pole!	999
	We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.	999
	999
WARWICK	Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset;	999
	His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,	999
	Third son to the third Edward King of England:	999
	Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	He bears him on the place's privilege,	999
	Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.	999
	999
SOMERSET	By him that made me, I'll maintain my words	999
	On any plot of ground in Christendom.	999
	Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,	999
	For treason executed in our late king's days?	999
	And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,	999
	Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?	999
	His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;	999
	And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	My father was attached, not attainted,	999
	Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;	999
	And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,	999
	Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.	999
	For your partaker Pole and you yourself,	999
	I'll note you in my book of memory,	999
	To scourge you for this apprehension:	999
	Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;	999
	And know us by these colours for thy foes,	999
	For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,	999
	As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,	999
	Will I for ever and my faction wear,	999
	Until it wither with me to my grave	999
	Or flourish to the height of my degree.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!	999
	And so farewell until I meet thee next.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SOMERSET	Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious Richard.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	How I am braved and must perforce endure it!	999
	999
WARWICK	This blot that they object against your house	999
	Shall be wiped out in the next parliament	999
	Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;	999
	And if thou be not then created York,	999
	I will not live to be accounted Warwick.	999
	Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,	999
	Against proud Somerset and William Pole,	999
	Will I upon thy party wear this rose:	999
	And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,	999
	Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,	999
	Shall send between the red rose and the white	999
	A thousand souls to death and deadly night.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,	999
	That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.	999
	999
VERNON	In your behalf still will I wear the same.	999
	999
Lawyer	And so will I.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Thanks, gentle sir.	999
	Come, let us four to dinner: I dare say	999
	This quarrel will drink blood another day.	999

	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
SCENE V	The Tower of London.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter MORTIMER, brought in a chair, and Gaolers]	999
	999
MORTIMER	Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,	999
	Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.	999
	Even like a man new haled from the rack,	999
	So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.	999
	And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,	999
	Nestor-like aged in an age of care,	999
	Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.	999
	These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,	999
	Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;	999
	Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,	999
	And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine	999
	That droops his sapless branches to the ground;	999
	Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,	999
	Unable to support this lump of clay,	999
	Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,	999
	As witting I no other comfort have.	999
	But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?	999
	999
First Gaoler	Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:	999
	We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;	999
	And answer was return'd that he will come.	999
	999
MORTIMER	Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.	999
	Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.	999
	Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,	999
	Before whose glory I was great in arms,	999
	This loathsome sequestration have I had:	999
	And even since then hath Richard been obscured,	999
	Deprived of honour and inheritance.	999
	But now the arbitrator of despairs,	999
	Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,	999
	With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:	999
	I would his troubles likewise were expired,	999
	That so he might recover what was lost.	999
	999
	[Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET]	999
	999
First Gaoler	My lord, your loving nephew now is come.	999
	999
MORTIMER	Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,	999
	Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.	999
	999
MORTIMER	Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,	999
	And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:	999
	O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,	999
	That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.	999
	And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,	999
	Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;	999
	And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.	999
	This day, in argument upon a case,	999
	Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;	999
	Among which terms he used his lavish tongue	999
	And did upbraid me with my father's death:	999
	Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,	999
	Else with the like I had requited him.	999
	Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,	999
	In honour of a true Plantagenet	999
	And for alliance sake, declare the cause	999
	My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.	999
	999
MORTIMER	That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me	999
	And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth	999
	Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,	999
	Was cursed instrument of his decease.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Discover more at large what cause that was,	999
	For I am ignorant and cannot guess.	999
	999
MORTIMER	I will, if that my fading breath permit	999
	And death approach not ere my tale be done.	999
	Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,	999
	Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,	999
	The first-begotten and the lawful heir,	999
	Of Edward king, the third of that descent:	999
	During whose reign the Percies of the north,	999
	Finding his usurpation most unjust,	999
	Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:	999
	The reason moved these warlike lords to this	999
	Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,	999
	Leaving no heir begotten of his body--	999
	I was the next by birth and parentage;	999
	For by my mother I derived am	999
	From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son	999
	To King Edward the Third; whereas he	999
	From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,	999
	Being but fourth of that heroic line.	999
	But mark: as in this haughty attempt	999
	They laboured to plant the rightful heir,	999
	I lost my liberty and they their lives.	999
	Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,	999
	Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,	999
	Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived	999
	From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,	999
	Marrying my sister that thy mother was,	999
	Again in pity of my hard distress	999
	Levied an army, weening to redeem	999
	And have install'd me in the diadem:	999
	But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl	999
	And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,	999
	In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.	999
	999
MORTIMER	True; and thou seest that I no issue have	999
	And that my fainting words do warrant death;	999
	Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:	999
	But yet be wary in thy studious care.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:	999
	But yet, methinks, my father's execution	999
	Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.	999
	999
MORTIMER	With silence, nephew, be thou politic:	999
	Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,	999
	And like a mountain, not to be removed.	999
	But now thy uncle is removing hence:	999
	As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd	999
	With long continuance in a settled place.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	O, uncle, would some part of my young years	999
	Might but redeem the passage of your age!	999
	999
MORTIMER	Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth	999
	Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.	999
	Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;	999
	Only give order for my funeral:	999
	And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes	999
	And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!	999
	In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage	999
	And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.	999
	Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;	999
	And what I do imagine let that rest.	999
	Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself	999
	Will see his burial better than his life.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out the body of MORTIMER]	999
	999
	Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,	999
	Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:	999
	And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,	999
	Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house:	999
	I doubt not but with honour to redress;	999
	And therefore haste I to the parliament,	999
	Either to be restored to my blood,	999
	Or make my ill the advantage of my good.	999

	WINCHESTER, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and others.	999
	GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill; BISHOP OF	999
	WINCHESTER snatches it, and tears it]	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,	999
	With written pamphlets studiously devised,	999
	Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,	999
	Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,	999
	Do it without invention, suddenly;	999
	As I with sudden and extemporal speech	999
	Purpose to answer what thou canst object.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,	999
	Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.	999
	Think not, although in writing I preferr'd	999
	The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,	999
	That therefore I have forged, or am not able	999
	Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:	999
	No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,	999
	Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,	999
	As very infants prattle of thy pride.	999
	Thou art a most pernicious usurer,	999
	Forward by nature, enemy to peace;	999
	Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems	999
	A man of thy profession and degree;	999
	And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?	999
	In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,	999
	As well at London bridge as at the Tower.	999
	Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,	999
	The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt	999
	From envious malice of thy swelling heart.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe	999
	To give me hearing what I shall reply.	999
	If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,	999
	As he will have me, how am I so poor?	999
	Or how haps it I seek not to advance	999
	Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?	999
	And for dissension, who preferreth peace	999
	More than I do?--except I be provoked.	999
	No, my good lords, it is not that offends;	999
	It is not that that hath incensed the duke:	999
	It is, because no one should sway but he;	999
	No one but he should be about the king;	999
	And that engenders thunder in his breast	999
	And makes him roar these accusations forth.	999
	But he shall know I am as good--	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	As good!	999
	Thou bastard of my grandfather!	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,	999
	But one imperious in another's throne?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Am I not protector, saucy priest?	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	And am not I a prelate of the church?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps	999
	And useth it to patronage his theft.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Unreverent Gloster!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Thou art reverent	999
	Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Rome shall remedy this.	999
	999
WARWICK	Roam thither, then.	999
	999
SOMERSET	My lord, it were your duty to forbear.	999
	999
WARWICK	Ay, see the bishop be not overborne.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Methinks my lord should be religious	999
	And know the office that belongs to such.	999
	999
WARWICK	Methinks his lordship should be humbler;	999
	it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.	999
	999
WARWICK	State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?	999
	Is not his grace protector to the king?	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	[Aside]  Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,	999
	Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;	999
	Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?'	999
	Else would I have a fling at Winchester.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,	999
	The special watchmen of our English weal,	999
	I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,	999
	To join your hearts in love and amity.	999
	O, what a scandal is it to our crown,	999
	That two such noble peers as ye should jar!	999
	Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell	999
	Civil dissension is a viperous worm	999
	That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.	999
	999
	[A noise within, 'Down with the tawny-coats!']	999
	999
	What tumult's this?	999
	999
WARWICK	An uproar, I dare warrant,	999
	Begun through malice of the bishop's men.	999
	999
	[A noise again, 'Stones! stones!' Enter Mayor]	999
	999
Mayor	O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,	999
	Pity the city of London, pity us!	999
	The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,	999
	Forbidden late to carry any weapon,	999
	Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones	999
	And banding themselves in contrary parts	999
	Do pelt so fast at one another's pate	999
	That many have their giddy brains knock'd out:	999
	Our windows are broke down in every street	999
	And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.	999
	999
	[Enter Serving-men, in skirmish, with bloody pates]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,	999
	To hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace.	999
	Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.	999
	999
First Serving-man	Nay, if we be forbidden stones,	999
	We'll fall to it with our teeth.	999
	999
Second Serving-man	Do what ye dare, we are as resolute.	999
	999
	[Skirmish again]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	You of my household, leave this peevish broil	999
	And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.	999
	999
Third Serving-man	My lord, we know your grace to be a man	999
	Just and upright; and, for your royal birth,	999
	Inferior to none but to his majesty:	999
	And ere that we will suffer such a prince,	999
	So kind a father of the commonweal,	999
	To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,	999
	We and our wives and children all will fight	999
	And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.	999
	999
First Serving-man	Ay, and the very parings of our nails	999
	Shall pitch a field when we are dead.	999
	999
	[Begin again]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Stay, stay, I say!	999
	And if you love me, as you say you do,	999
	Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!	999
	Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold	999
	My sighs and tears and will not once relent?	999
	Who should be pitiful, if you be not?	999
	Or who should study to prefer a peace.	999
	If holy churchmen take delight in broils?	999
	999
WARWICK	Yield, my lord protector; yield, Winchester;	999
	Except you mean with obstinate repulse	999
	To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.	999
	You see what mischief and what murder too	999
	Hath been enacted through your enmity;	999
	Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	He shall submit, or I will never yield.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Compassion on the king commands me stoop;	999
	Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest	999
	Should ever get that privilege of me.	999
	999
WARWICK	Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke	999
	Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,	999
	As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:	999
	Why look you still so stern and tragical?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach	999
	That malice was a great and grievous sin;	999
	And will not you maintain the thing you teach,	999
	But prove a chief offender in the same?	999
	999
WARWICK	Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.	999
	For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!	999
	What, shall a child instruct you what to do?	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;	999
	Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  Ay, but, I fear me, with a hollow heart.--	999
	See here, my friends and loving countrymen,	999
	This token serveth for a flag of truce	999
	Betwixt ourselves and all our followers:	999
	So help me God, as I dissemble not!	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	[Aside]  So help me God, as I intend it not!	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	O, loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,	999
	How joyful am I made by this contract!	999
	Away, my masters! trouble us no more;	999
	But join in friendship, as your lords have done.	999
	999
First Serving-man	Content: I'll to the surgeon's.	999
	999
Second Serving-man	And so will I.	999
	999
Third Serving-man	And I will see what physic the tavern affords.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Serving-men, Mayor, &c]	999
	999
WARWICK	Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,	999
	Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet	999
	We do exhibit to your majesty.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Well urged, my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince,	999
	And if your grace mark every circumstance,	999
	You have great reason to do Richard right;	999
	Especially for those occasions	999
	At Eltham Place I told your majesty.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	And those occasions, uncle, were of force:	999
	Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is	999
	That Richard be restored to his blood.	999
	999
WARWICK	Let Richard be restored to his blood;	999
	So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	As will the rest, so willeth Winchester.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	If Richard will be true, not that alone	999
	But all the whole inheritance I give	999
	That doth belong unto the house of York,	999
	From whence you spring by lineal descent.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	Thy humble servant vows obedience	999
	And humble service till the point of death.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;	999
	And, in reguerdon of that duty done,	999
	I gird thee with the valiant sword of York:	999
	Rise Richard, like a true Plantagenet,	999
	And rise created princely Duke of York.	999
	999
RICHARD	999
PLANTAGENET	And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!	999
	And as my duty springs, so perish they	999
	That grudge one thought against your majesty!	999
	999
ALL	Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York!	999
	999
SOMERSET	[Aside]  Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Now will it best avail your majesty	999
	To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France:	999
	The presence of a king engenders love	999
	Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,	999
	As it disanimates his enemies.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes;	999
	For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Your ships already are in readiness.	999
	999
	[Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but EXETER]	999
	999
EXETER	Ay, we may march in England or in France,	999
	Not seeing what is likely to ensue.	999
	This late dissension grown betwixt the peers	999
	Burns under feigned ashes of forged love	999
	And will at last break out into a flame:	999
	As fester'd members rot but by degree,	999
	Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,	999
	So will this base and envious discord breed.	999
	And now I fear that fatal prophecy	999
	Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth	999
	Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;	999
	That Henry born at Monmouth should win all	999
	And Henry born at Windsor lose all:	999
	Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish	999
	His days may finish ere that hapless time.	999

	999
SCENE II	France. Before Rouen.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE disguised, with four Soldiers	999
	with sacks upon their backs]	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,	999
	Through which our policy must make a breach:	999
	Take heed, be wary how you place your words;	999
	Talk like the vulgar sort of market men	999
	That come to gather money for their corn.	999
	If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,	999
	And that we find the slothful watch but weak,	999
	I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,	999
	That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.	999
	999
First Soldier	Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,	999
	And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;	999
	Therefore we'll knock.	999
	999
	[Knocks]	999
	999
Watch	[Within]  Qui est la?	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Paysans, pauvres gens de France;	999
	Poor market folks that come to sell their corn.	999
	999
Watch	Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Now, Rouen, I'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON,	999
	REIGNIER, and forces]	999
	999
CHARLES	Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!	999
	And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.	999
	999
BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Here enter'd Pucelle and her practisants;	999
	Now she is there, how will she specify	999
	Where is the best and safest passage in?	999
	999
REIGNIER	By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower;	999
	Which, once discern'd, shows that her meaning is,	999
	No way to that, for weakness, which she enter'd.	999
	999
	[Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE on the top, thrusting out a	999
	torch burning]	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Behold, this is the happy wedding torch	999
	That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen,	999
	But burning fatal to the Talbotites!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BASTARD OF ORLEANS	See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend;	999
	The burning torch in yonder turret stands.	999
	999
CHARLES	Now shine it like a comet of revenge,	999
	A prophet to the fall of all our foes!	999
	999
REIGNIER	Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends;	999
	Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,	999
	And then do execution on the watch.	999
	999
	[Alarum. Exeunt]	999
	999
	[An alarum. Enter TALBOT in an excursion]	999
	999
TALBOT	France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,	999
	If Talbot but survive thy treachery.	999
	Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress,	999
	Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,	999
	That hardly we escaped the pride of France.	999

	in a chair. Enter TALBOT and BURGUNDY without:	999
	within JOAN LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, BASTARD OF ORLEANS,	999
	ALENCON, and REIGNIER, on the walls]	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?	999
	I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast	999
	Before he'll buy again at such a rate:	999
	'Twas full of darnel; do you like the taste?	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan!	999
	I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own	999
	And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.	999
	999
CHARLES	Your grace may starve perhaps before that time.	999
	999
BEDFORD	O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance,	999
	And run a tilt at death within a chair?	999
	999
TALBOT	Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,	999
	Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours!	999
	Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age	999
	And twit with cowardice a man half dead?	999
	Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,	999
	Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Are ye so hot, sir? yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace;	999
	If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow.	999
	999
	[The English whisper together in council]	999
	999
	God speed the parliament! who shall be the speaker?	999
	999
TALBOT	Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,	999
	To try if that our own be ours or no.	999
	999
TALBOT	I speak not to that railing Hecate,	999
	But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest;	999
	Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?	999
	999
ALENCON	Signior, no.	999
	999
TALBOT	Signior, hang! base muleters of France!	999
	Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls	999
	And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Away, captains! let's get us from the walls;	999
	For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.	999
	God be wi' you, my lord! we came but to tell you	999
	That we are here.	999
	999
	[Exeunt from the walls]	999
	999
TALBOT	And there will we be too, ere it be long,	999
	Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!	999
	Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,	999
	Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,	999
	Either to get the town again or die:	999
	And I, as sure as English Henry lives	999
	And as his father here was conqueror,	999
	As sure as in this late-betrayed town	999
	Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried,	999
	So sure I swear to get the town or die.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	My vows are equal partners with thy vows.	999
	999
TALBOT	But, ere we go, regard this dying prince,	999
	The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,	999
	We will bestow you in some better place,	999
	Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.	999
	999
BEDFORD	Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me:	999
	Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen	999
	And will be partner of your weal or woe.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.	999
	999
BEDFORD	Not to be gone from hence; for once I read	999
	That stout Pendragon in his litter sick	999
	Came to the field and vanquished his foes:	999
	Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,	999
	Because I ever found them as myself.	999
	999
TALBOT	Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!	999
	Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!	999
	And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,	999
	But gather we our forces out of hand	999
	And set upon our boasting enemy.	999

Captain	Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?	999
	999
FASTOLFE	Whither away! to save myself by flight:	999
	We are like to have the overthrow again.	999
	999
Captain	What! will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot?	999
	999
FASTOLFE	Ay,	999
	All the Talbots in the world, to save my life!	999

	999
BEDFORD	Now, quiet soul, depart when heaven please,	999
	For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.	999
	What is the trust or strength of foolish man?	999
	They that of late were daring with their scoffs	999
	Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.	999

	999
	[An alarum. Re-enter TALBOT, BURGUNDY, and the rest]	999

TALBOT	Lost, and recover'd in a day again!	999
	This is a double honour, Burgundy:	999
	Yet heavens have glory for this victory!	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy	999
	Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects	999
	Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.	999
	999
TALBOT	Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?	999
	I think her old familiar is asleep:	999
	Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?	999
	What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief	999
	That such a valiant company are fled.	999
	Now will we take some order in the town,	999
	Placing therein some expert officers,	999
	And then depart to Paris to the king,	999
	For there young Henry with his nobles lie.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.	999
	999
TALBOT	But yet, before we go, let's not forget	999
	The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,	999
	But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen:	999
	A braver soldier never couched lance,	999
	A gentler heart did never sway in court;	999
	But kings and mightiest potentates must die,	999
	For that's the end of human misery.	999

	[Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, JOAN	999
	LA PUCELLE, and forces]	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Dismay not, princes, at this accident,	999
	Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:	999
	Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,	999
	For things that are not to be remedied.	999
	Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while	999
	And like a peacock sweep along his tail;	999
	We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,	999
	If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.	999
	999
CHARLES	We have been guided by thee hitherto,	999
	And of thy cunning had no diffidence:	999
	One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.	999
	999
BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Search out thy wit for secret policies,	999
	And we will make thee famous through the world.	999
	999
ALENCON	We'll set thy statue in some holy place,	999
	And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:	999
	Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:	999
	By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words	999
	We will entice the Duke of Burgundy	999
	To leave the Talbot and to follow us.	999
	999
CHARLES	Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,	999
	France were no place for Henry's warriors;	999
	Nor should that nation boast it so with us,	999
	But be extirped from our provinces.	999
	999
ALENCON	For ever should they be expulsed from France	999
	And not have title of an earldom here.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Your honours shall perceive how I will work	999
	To bring this matter to the wished end.	999
	999

	999

	999
	[Here sound an English march. Enter, and pass over	999
	at a distance, TALBOT and his forces]	999
	999
	There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,	999
	And all the troops of English after him.	999
	999
	[French march. Enter BURGUNDY and forces]	999
	999
	Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:	999
	Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.	999
	Summon a parley; we will talk with him.	999
	999
	[Trumpets sound a parley]	999
	999
CHARLES	A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching hence.	999
	999
CHARLES	Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!	999
	Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Speak on; but be not over-tedious.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Look on thy country, look on fertile France,	999
	And see the cities and the towns defaced	999
	By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.	999
	As looks the mother on her lowly babe	999
	When death doth close his tender dying eyes,	999
	See, see the pining malady of France;	999
	Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,	999
	Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.	999
	O, turn thy edged sword another way;	999
	Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.	999
	One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom	999
	Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:	999
	Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,	999
	And wash away thy country's stained spots.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,	999
	Or nature makes me suddenly relent.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,	999
	Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.	999
	Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation	999
	That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?	999
	When Talbot hath set footing once in France	999
	And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,	999
	Who then but English Henry will be lord	999
	And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?	999
	Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,	999
	Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?	999
	And was he not in England prisoner?	999
	But when they heard he was thine enemy,	999
	They set him free without his ransom paid,	999
	In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.	999
	See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen	999
	And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.	999
	Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord:	999
	Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers	999
	Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,	999
	And made me almost yield upon my knees.	999
	Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,	999
	And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:	999
	My forces and my power of men are yours:	999
	So farewell, Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	[Aside]  Done like a Frenchman: turn, and turn again!	999
	999
CHARLES	Welcome, brave duke! thy friendship makes us fresh.	999
	999
BASTARD OF ORLEANS	And doth beget new courage in our breasts.	999
	999
ALENCON	Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this,	999
	And doth deserve a coronet of gold.	999

	And seek how we may prejudice the foe.	999

	999
TALBOT	My gracious prince, and honourable peers,	999
	Hearing of your arrival in this realm,	999
	I have awhile given truce unto my wars,	999
	To do my duty to my sovereign:	999
	In sign, whereof, this arm, that hath reclaim'd	999
	To your obedience fifty fortresses,	999
	Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength,	999
	Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,	999
	Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,	999
	And with submissive loyalty of heart	999

	First to my God and next unto your grace.	999

KING HENRY VI	Is this the Lord Talbot, uncle Gloucester,	999
	That hath so long been resident in France?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!	999
	When I was young, as yet I am not old,	999
	I do remember how my father said	999
	A stouter champion never handled sword.	999
	Long since we were resolved of your truth,	999
	Your faithful service and your toil in war;	999
	Yet never have you tasted our reward,	999
	Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks,	999
	Because till now we never saw your face:	999
	Therefore, stand up; and, for these good deserts,	999
	We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;	999
	And in our coronation take your place.	999
	999
	[Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but VERNON and BASSET]	999

VERNON	Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,	999
	Disgracing of these colours that I wear	999
	In honour of my noble Lord of York:	999
	Darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest?	999
	999
BASSET	Yes, sir; as well as you dare patronage	999
	The envious barking of your saucy tongue	999
	Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.	999
	999
VERNON	Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.	999
	999
BASSET	Why, what is he? as good a man as York.	999
	999
VERNON	Hark ye; not so: in witness, take ye that.	999
	999
	[Strikes him]	999
	999
BASSET	Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such	999
	That whoso draws a sword, 'tis present death,	999
	Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.	999
	But I'll unto his majesty, and crave	999
	I may have liberty to venge this wrong;	999
	When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.	999
	999
VERNON	Well, miscreant, I'll be there as soon as you;	999

	999
GLOUCESTER	Lord bishop, set the crown upon his head.	999
	999
BISHOP	999
OF WINCHESTER	God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Now, governor of Paris, take your oath,	999
	That you elect no other king but him;	999
	Esteem none friends but such as are his friends,	999
	And none your foes but such as shall pretend	999
	Malicious practises against his state:	999
	This shall ye do, so help you righteous God!	999
	999
	[Enter FASTOLFE]	999
	999
FASTOLFE	My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,	999
	To haste unto your coronation,	999
	A letter was deliver'd to my hands,	999
	Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy.	999
	999
TALBOT	Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!	999
	I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,	999
	To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,	999
	999
	[Plucking it off]	999
	999
	Which I have done, because unworthily	999
	Thou wast installed in that high degree.	999
	Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest	999
	This dastard, at the battle of Patay,	999
	When but in all I was six thousand strong	999
	And that the French were almost ten to one,	999
	Before we met or that a stroke was given,	999
	Like to a trusty squire did run away:	999
	In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;	999
	Myself and divers gentlemen beside	999
	Were there surprised and taken prisoners.	999
	Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;	999
	Or whether that such cowards ought to wear	999
	This ornament of knighthood, yea or no.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	To say the truth, this fact was infamous	999
	And ill beseeming any common man,	999
	Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.	999
	999
TALBOT	When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,	999
	Knights of the garter were of noble birth,	999
	Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,	999
	Such as were grown to credit by the wars;	999
	Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,	999
	But always resolute in most extremes.	999
	He then that is not furnish'd in this sort	999
	Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,	999
	Profaning this most honourable order,	999
	And should, if I were worthy to be judge,	999
	Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain	999
	That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!	999
	Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight:	999
	Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.	999
	999
	[Exit FASTOLFE]	999
	999
	And now, my lord protector, view the letter	999
	Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?	999
	No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!'	999
	Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?	999
	Or doth this churlish superscription	999
	Pretend some alteration in good will?	999
	What's here?	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'I have, upon especial cause,	999
	Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,	999
	Together with the pitiful complaints	999
	Of such as your oppression feeds upon,	999
	Forsaken your pernicious faction	999
	And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'	999
	O monstrous treachery! can this be so,	999
	That in alliance, amity and oaths,	999
	There should be found such false dissembling guile?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Is that the worst this letter doth contain?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him	999
	And give him chastisement for this abuse.	999
	How say you, my lord? are you not content?	999
	999
TALBOT	Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented,	999
	I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Then gather strength and march unto him straight:	999
	Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason	999
	And what offence it is to flout his friends.	999
	999
TALBOT	I go, my lord, in heart desiring still	999
	You may behold confusion of your foes.	999

	[Enter VERNON and BASSET]	999

VERNON	Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.	999
	999
BASSET	And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.	999
	999
YORK	This is my servant: hear him, noble prince.	999
	999
SOMERSET	And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Be patient, lords; and give them leave to speak.	999
	Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?	999
	And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?	999
	999
VERNON	With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.	999
	999
BASSET	And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	What is that wrong whereof you both complain?	999
	First let me know, and then I'll answer you.	999
	999
BASSET	Crossing the sea from England into France,	999
	This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,	999
	Upbraided me about the rose I wear;	999
	Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves	999
	Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,	999
	When stubbornly he did repugn the truth	999
	About a certain question in the law	999
	Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;	999
	With other vile and ignominious terms:	999
	In confutation of which rude reproach	999
	And in defence of my lord's worthiness,	999
	I crave the benefit of law of arms.	999
	999
VERNON	And that is my petition, noble lord:	999
	For though he seem with forged quaint conceit	999
	To set a gloss upon his bold intent,	999
	Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him;	999
	And he first took exceptions at this badge,	999
	Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower	999
	Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.	999
	999
YORK	Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?	999
	999
SOMERSET	Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,	999
	Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,	999
	When for so slight and frivolous a cause	999
	Such factious emulations shall arise!	999
	Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,	999
	Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.	999
	999
YORK	Let this dissension first be tried by fight,	999
	And then your highness shall command a peace.	999
	999
SOMERSET	The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;	999
	Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.	999
	999
YORK	There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.	999
	999
VERNON	Nay, let it rest where it began at first.	999
	999
BASSET	Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!	999
	And perish ye, with your audacious prate!	999
	Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed	999
	With this immodest clamorous outrage	999
	To trouble and disturb the king and us?	999
	And you, my lords, methinks you do not well	999
	To bear with their perverse objections;	999
	Much less to take occasion from their mouths	999
	To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:	999
	Let me persuade you take a better course.	999
	999
EXETER	It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Come hither, you that would be combatants:	999
	Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,	999
	Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.	999
	And you, my lords, remember where we are,	999
	In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:	999
	If they perceive dissension in our looks	999
	And that within ourselves we disagree,	999
	How will their grudging stomachs be provoked	999
	To wilful disobedience, and rebel!	999
	Beside, what infamy will there arise,	999
	When foreign princes shall be certified	999
	That for a toy, a thing of no regard,	999
	King Henry's peers and chief nobility	999
	Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!	999
	O, think upon the conquest of my father,	999
	My tender years, and let us not forego	999
	That for a trifle that was bought with blood	999
	Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.	999
	I see no reason, if I wear this rose,	999
	999
	[Putting on a red rose]	999
	999
	That any one should therefore be suspicious	999
	I more incline to Somerset than York:	999
	Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:	999
	As well they may upbraid me with my crown,	999
	Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd.	999
	But your discretions better can persuade	999
	Than I am able to instruct or teach:	999
	And therefore, as we hither came in peace,	999
	So let us still continue peace and love.	999
	Cousin of York, we institute your grace	999
	To be our regent in these parts of France:	999
	And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite	999
	Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;	999
	And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,	999
	Go cheerfully together and digest.	999
	Your angry choler on your enemies.	999
	Ourself, my lord protector and the rest	999
	After some respite will return to Calais;	999
	From thence to England; where I hope ere long	999
	To be presented, by your victories,	999
	With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout.	999
	999
	[Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK, EXETER	999

	999
WARWICK	My Lord of York, I promise you, the king	999
	Prettily, methought, did play the orator.	999
	999
YORK	And so he did; but yet I like it not,	999
	In that he wears the badge of Somerset.	999
	999
WARWICK	Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not;	999
	I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.	999
	999
YORK	An if I wist he did,--but let it rest;	999
	Other affairs must now be managed.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but EXETER]	999
	999
EXETER	Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;	999
	For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,	999
	I fear we should have seen decipher'd there	999
	More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,	999
	Than yet can be imagined or supposed.	999
	But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees	999
	This jarring discord of nobility,	999
	This shouldering of each other in the court,	999
	This factious bandying of their favourites,	999
	But that it doth presage some ill event.	999
	'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;	999

	999
	[Trumpet sounds. Enter General and others, aloft]	999
	999
	English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,	999
	Servant in arms to Harry King of England;	999
	And thus he would: Open your city gates;	999
	Be humble to us; call my sovereign yours,	999
	And do him homage as obedient subjects;	999
	And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power:	999
	But, if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,	999
	You tempt the fury of my three attendants,	999
	Lean famine, quartering steel, and climbing fire;	999
	Who in a moment even with the earth	999
	Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers,	999
	If you forsake the offer of their love.	999
	999
General	Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,	999
	Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!	999
	The period of thy tyranny approacheth.	999
	On us thou canst not enter but by death;	999
	For, I protest, we are well fortified	999
	And strong enough to issue out and fight:	999
	If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,	999
	Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:	999
	On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd,	999
	To wall thee from the liberty of flight;	999
	And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,	999
	But death doth front thee with apparent spoil	999
	And pale destruction meets thee in the face.	999
	Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament	999
	To rive their dangerous artillery	999
	Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.	999
	Lo, there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man,	999
	Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit!	999
	This is the latest glory of thy praise	999
	That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;	999
	For ere the glass, that now begins to run,	999
	Finish the process of his sandy hour,	999
	These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,	999
	Shall see thee wither'd, bloody, pale and dead.	999
	999
	[Drum afar off]	999
	999
	Hark! hark! the Dauphin's drum, a warning bell,	999
	Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul;	999
	And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.	999
	999
	[Exeunt General, &c]	999

TALBOT	He fables not; I hear the enemy:	999
	Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.	999
	O, negligent and heedless discipline!	999
	How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,	999
	A little herd of England's timorous deer,	999
	Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!	999
	If we be English deer, be then in blood;	999
	Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,	999
	But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,	999
	Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel	999
	And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:	999
	Sell every man his life as dear as mine,	999
	And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.	999

	999
YORK	O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart	999
	Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!	999
	So should we save a valiant gentleman	999
	By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.	999
	Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,	999
	That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.	999
	999
LUCY	O, send some succor to the distress'd lord!	999
	999
YORK	He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;	999
	We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get;	999
	All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset.	999
	999
LUCY	Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul;	999
	And on his son young John, who two hours since	999
	I met in travel toward his warlike father!	999
	This seven years did not Talbot see his son;	999
	And now they meet where both their lives are done.	999
	999
YORK	Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have	999
	To bid his young son welcome to his grave?	999
	Away! vexation almost stops my breath,	999
	That sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death.	999
	Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,	999
	But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.	999
	Maine, Blois, Poictiers, and Tours, are won away,	999
	'Long all of Somerset and his delay.	999

	[Enter SOMERSET, with his army; a Captain of	999
	TALBOT's with him]	999
	999
SOMERSET	It is too late; I cannot send them now:	999
	This expedition was by York and Talbot	999
	Too rashly plotted: all our general force	999
	Might with a sally of the very town	999
	Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot	999
	Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour	999
	By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure:	999
	York set him on to fight and die in shame,	999
	That, Talbot dead, great York might bear the name.	999
	999
Captain	Here is Sir William Lucy, who with me	999
	Set from our o'ermatch'd forces forth for aid.	999
	999
	[Enter Sir William LUCY]	999
	999
SOMERSET	How now, Sir William! whither were you sent?	999
	999
LUCY	Whither, my lord? from bought and sold Lord Talbot;	999
	Who, ring'd about with bold adversity,	999
	Cries out for noble York and Somerset,	999
	To beat assailing death from his weak legions:	999
	And whiles the honourable captain there	999
	Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,	999
	And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue,	999
	You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour,	999
	Keep off aloof with worthless emulation.	999
	Let not your private discord keep away	999
	The levied succors that should lend him aid,	999
	While he, renowned noble gentleman,	999
	Yields up his life unto a world of odds:	999
	Orleans the Bastard, Charles, Burgundy,	999
	Alencon, Reignier, compass him about,	999
	And Talbot perisheth by your default.	999
	999
SOMERSET	York set him on; York should have sent him aid.	999
	999
LUCY	And York as fast upon your grace exclaims;	999
	Swearing that you withhold his levied host,	999
	Collected for this expedition.	999
	999
SOMERSET	York lies; he might have sent and had the horse;	999
	I owe him little duty, and less love;	999
	And take foul scorn to fawn on him by sending.	999
	999
LUCY	The fraud of England, not the force of France,	999
	Hath now entrapp'd the noble-minded Talbot:	999
	Never to England shall he bear his life;	999
	But dies, betray'd to fortune by your strife.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Come, go; I will dispatch the horsemen straight:	999
	Within six hours they will be at his aid.	999
	999
LUCY	Too late comes rescue: he is ta'en or slain;	999
	For fly he could not, if he would have fled;	999
	And fly would Talbot never, though he might.	999
	999
SOMERSET	If he be dead, brave Talbot, then adieu!	999

	999
	[Enter TALBOT and JOHN his son]	999
	999
TALBOT	O young John Talbot! I did send for thee	999
	To tutor thee in stratagems of war,	999
	That Talbot's name might be in thee revived	999
	When sapless age and weak unable limbs	999
	Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.	999
	But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!	999
	Now thou art come unto a feast of death,	999
	A terrible and unavoided danger:	999
	Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse;	999
	And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape	999
	By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone.	999
	999
JOHN TALBOT	Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?	999
	And shall I fly? O if you love my mother,	999
	Dishonour not her honourable name,	999
	To make a bastard and a slave of me!	999
	The world will say, he is not Talbot's blood,	999
	That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.	999
	999
TALBOT	Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.	999
	999
JOHN TALBOT	He that flies so will ne'er return again.	999
	999
TALBOT	If we both stay, we both are sure to die.	999
	999
JOHN TALBOT	Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly:	999
	Your loss is great, so your regard should be;	999
	My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.	999
	Upon my death the French can little boast;	999
	In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.	999
	Flight cannot stain the honour you have won;	999
	But mine it will, that no exploit have done:	999
	You fled for vantage, everyone will swear;	999
	But, if I bow, they'll say it was for fear.	999
	There is no hope that ever I will stay,	999
	If the first hour I shrink and run away.	999
	Here on my knee I beg mortality,	999
	Rather than life preserved with infamy.	999
	999
TALBOT	Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?	999
	999
JOHN TALBOT	Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.	999
	999
TALBOT	Upon my blessing, I command thee go.	999
	999
JOHN TALBOT	To fight I will, but not to fly the foe.	999
	999
TALBOT	Part of thy father may be saved in thee.	999
	999
JOHN TALBOT	No part of him but will be shame in me.	999
	999
TALBOT	Thou never hadst renown, nor canst not lose it.	999
	999
JOHN TALBOT	Yes, your renowned name: shall flight abuse it?	999
	999
TALBOT	Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.	999
	999
JOHN TALBOT	You cannot witness for me, being slain.	999
	If death be so apparent, then both fly.	999
	999
TALBOT	And leave my followers here to fight and die?	999
	My age was never tainted with such shame.	999
	999
JOHN TALBOT	And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?	999
	No more can I be sever'd from your side,	999
	Than can yourself yourself in twain divide:	999
	Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I;	999
	For live I will not, if my father die.	999
	999
TALBOT	Then here I take my leave of thee, fair son,	999
	Born to eclipse thy life this afternoon.	999
	Come, side by side together live and die.	999
	And soul with soul from France to heaven fly.	999

	999
TALBOT	Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight.	999
	The regent hath with Talbot broke his word	999
	And left us to the rage of France his sword.	999
	Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath;	999
	I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.	999
	999
JOHN TALBOT	O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!	999
	The life thou gavest me first was lost and done,	999
	Till with thy warlike sword, despite of late,	999
	To my determined time thou gavest new date.	999
	999
TALBOT	When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,	999
	It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire	999
	Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,	999
	Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,	999
	Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,	999
	And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.	999
	The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood	999
	From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood	999
	Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,	999
	And interchanging blows I quickly shed	999
	Some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace	999
	Bespoke him thus; 'Contaminated, base	999
	And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,	999
	Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine	999
	Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:'	999
	Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,	999
	Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care,	999
	Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?	999
	Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,	999
	Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?	999
	Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:	999
	The help of one stands me in little stead.	999
	O, too much folly is it, well I wot,	999
	To hazard all our lives in one small boat!	999
	If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,	999
	To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:	999
	By me they nothing gain an if I stay;	999
	'Tis but the shortening of my life one day:	999
	In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,	999
	My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame:	999
	All these and more we hazard by thy stay;	999
	All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.	999
	999
JOHN TALBOT	The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;	999
	These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:	999
	On that advantage, bought with such a shame,	999
	To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,	999
	Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,	999
	The coward horse that bears me fail and die!	999
	And like me to the peasant boys of France,	999
	To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!	999
	Surely, by all the glory you have won,	999
	An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son:	999
	Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;	999
	If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.	999
	999
TALBOT	Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,	999
	Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet:	999
	If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side;	999
	And, commendable proved, let's die in pride.	999

	His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,	999
	And, like a hungry lion, did commence	999
	Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;	999
	But when my angry guardant stood alone,	999
	Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,	999
	Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart	999
	Suddenly made him from my side to start	999
	Into the clustering battle of the French;	999
	And in that sea of blood my boy did drench	999
	His over-mounting spirit, and there died,	999

	Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,	999
	In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.	999
	O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour'd death,	999
	Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!	999
	Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no;	999
	Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.	999

BASTARD OF ORLEANS	How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging-wood,	999
	Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:	999
	'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid:'	999
	But, with a proud majestical high scorn,	999
	He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born	999
	To be the pillage of a giglot wench:'	999
	So, rushing in the bowels of the French,	999
	He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;	999
	See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms	999
	Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!	999

BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Hew them to pieces, hack their bones asunder	999

	[Enter CHARLES, BURGUNDY, ALENCON, BASTARD OF	999
	ORLEANS, REIGNIER, JOAN LA PUCELLE, and forces]	999
	999
CHARLES	These news, my lord, may cheer our drooping spirits:	999
	'Tis said the stout Parisians do revolt	999
	And turn again unto the warlike French.	999
	999
ALENCON	Then march to Paris, royal Charles of France,	999
	And keep not back your powers in dalliance.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Peace be amongst them, if they turn to us;	999
	Else, ruin combat with their palaces!	999
	999
	[Enter Scout]	999
	999
Scout	Success unto our valiant general,	999
	And happiness to his accomplices!	999
	999
CHARLES	What tidings send our scouts? I prithee, speak.	999
	999
Scout	The English army, that divided was	999
	Into two parties, is now conjoined in one,	999
	And means to give you battle presently.	999
	999
CHARLES	Somewhat too sudden, sirs, the warning is;	999
	But we will presently provide for them.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	I trust the ghost of Talbot is not there:	999
	Now he is gone, my lord, you need not fear.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Of all base passions, fear is most accursed.	999
	Command the conquest, Charles, it shall be thine,	999
	Let Henry fret and all the world repine.	999
	999
CHARLES	Then on, my lords; and France be fortunate!	999

SCENE III	Before Angiers.	999
	999
	999
	[Alarum. Excursions. Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE]	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	The regent conquers, and the Frenchmen fly.	999
	Now help, ye charming spells and periapts;	999
	And ye choice spirits that admonish me	999
	And give me signs of future accidents.	999
	999
	[Thunder]	999
	999
	You speedy helpers, that are substitutes	999
	Under the lordly monarch of the north,	999
	Appear and aid me in this enterprise.	999
	999
	[Enter Fiends]	999
	999
	This speedy and quick appearance argues proof	999
	Of your accustom'd diligence to me.	999
	Now, ye familiar spirits, that are cull'd	999
	Out of the powerful regions under earth,	999
	Help me this once, that France may get the field.	999
	999
	[They walk, and speak not]	999
	999
	O, hold me not with silence over-long!	999
	Where I was wont to feed you with my blood,	999
	I'll lop a member off and give it you	999
	In earnest of further benefit,	999
	So you do condescend to help me now.	999
	999
	[They hang their heads]	999
	999
	No hope to have redress? My body shall	999
	Pay recompense, if you will grant my suit.	999
	999
	[They shake their heads]	999
	999
	Cannot my body nor blood-sacrifice	999
	Entreat you to your wonted furtherance?	999
	Then take my soul, my body, soul and all,	999
	Before that England give the French the foil.	999
	999
	[They depart]	999
	999
	See, they forsake me! Now the time is come	999
	That France must vail her lofty-plumed crest	999
	And let her head fall into England's lap.	999
	My ancient incantations are too weak,	999
	And hell too strong for me to buckle with:	999
	Now, France, thy glory droopeth to the dust.	999

	999
YORK	Damsel of France, I think I have you fast:	999
	Unchain your spirits now with spelling charms	999
	And try if they can gain your liberty.	999
	A goodly prize, fit for the devil's grace!	999
	See, how the ugly wench doth bend her brows,	999
	As if with Circe she would change my shape!	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Changed to a worser shape thou canst not be.	999
	999
YORK	O, Charles the Dauphin is a proper man;	999
	No shape but his can please your dainty eye.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	A plaguing mischief light on Charles and thee!	999
	And may ye both be suddenly surprised	999
	By bloody hands, in sleeping on your beds!	999
	999
YORK	Fell banning hag, enchantress, hold thy tongue!	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	I prithee, give me leave to curse awhile.	999
	999

	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Alarum. Enter SUFFOLK with MARGARET in his hand]	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Be what thou wilt, thou art my prisoner.	999
	999
	[Gazes on her]	999
	999
	O fairest beauty, do not fear nor fly!	999
	For I will touch thee but with reverent hands;	999
	I kiss these fingers for eternal peace,	999
	And lay them gently on thy tender side.	999
	Who art thou? say, that I may honour thee.	999
	999
MARGARET	Margaret my name, and daughter to a king,	999
	The King of Naples, whosoe'er thou art.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	An earl I am, and Suffolk am I call'd.	999
	Be not offended, nature's miracle,	999
	Thou art allotted to be ta'en by me:	999
	So doth the swan her downy cygnets save,	999
	Keeping them prisoner underneath her wings.	999
	Yet, if this servile usage once offend.	999
	Go, and be free again, as Suffolk's friend.	999
	999
	[She is going]	999
	999
	O, stay! I have no power to let her pass;	999
	My hand would free her, but my heart says no	999
	As plays the sun upon the glassy streams,	999
	Twinkling another counterfeited beam,	999
	So seems this gorgeous beauty to mine eyes.	999
	Fain would I woo her, yet I dare not speak:	999
	I'll call for pen and ink, and write my mind.	999
	Fie, de la Pole! disable not thyself;	999
	Hast not a tongue? is she not here?	999
	Wilt thou be daunted at a woman's sight?	999
	Ay, beauty's princely majesty is such,	999
	Confounds the tongue and makes the senses rough.	999
	999
MARGARET	Say, Earl of Suffolk--if thy name be so--	999
	What ransom must I pay before I pass?	999
	For I perceive I am thy prisoner.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	How canst thou tell she will deny thy suit,	999
	Before thou make a trial of her love?	999
	999
MARGARET	Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd;	999
	She is a woman, therefore to be won.	999
	999
MARGARET	Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife;	999
	Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?	999
	999
MARGARET	I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card.	999
	999
MARGARET	He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	And yet a dispensation may be had.	999
	999
MARGARET	And yet I would that you would answer me.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?	999
	Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!	999
	999
MARGARET	He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,	999
	And peace established between these realms	999
	But there remains a scruple in that too;	999
	For though her father be the King of Naples,	999
	Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,	999
	And our nobility will scorn the match.	999
	999
MARGARET	Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much.	999
	Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.	999
	Madam, I have a secret to reveal.	999
	999
MARGARET	What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,	999
	And will not any way dishonour me.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.	999
	999
MARGARET	Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French;	999
	And then I need not crave his courtesy.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause--	999
	999
MARGARET	Tush, women have been captivate ere now.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Lady, wherefore talk you so?	999
	999
MARGARET	I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose	999
	Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?	999
	999
MARGARET	To be a queen in bondage is more vile	999
	Than is a slave in base servility;	999
	For princes should be free.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	And so shall you,	999
	If happy England's royal king be free.	999
	999
MARGARET	Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,	999
	To put a golden sceptre in thy hand	999
	And set a precious crown upon thy head,	999
	If thou wilt condescend to be my--	999
	999
MARGARET	What?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	His love.	999
	999
MARGARET	I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	No, gentle madam; I unworthy am	999
	To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,	999
	And have no portion in the choice myself.	999
	How say you, madam, are ye so content?	999
	999
MARGARET	An if my father please, I am content.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Then call our captains and our colours forth.	999
	And, madam, at your father's castle walls	999
	We'll crave a parley, to confer with him.	999
	999
	[A parley sounded. Enter REIGNIER on the walls]	999
	999
	See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!	999
	999
REIGNIER	To whom?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	       To me.	999
	999
REIGNIER	                  Suffolk, what remedy?	999
	I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,	999
	Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:	999
	Consent, and for thy honour give consent,	999
	Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king;	999
	Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;	999
	And this her easy-held imprisonment	999
	Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.	999
	999
REIGNIER	Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Fair Margaret knows	999
	That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.	999
	999
REIGNIER	Upon thy princely warrant, I descend	999
	To give thee answer of thy just demand.	999
	999
	[Exit from the walls]	999
	999
SUFFOLK	And here I will expect thy coming.	999
	999
	[Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER, below]	999
	999
REIGNIER	Welcome, brave earl, into our territories:	999
	Command in Anjou what your honour pleases.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,	999
	Fit to be made companion with a king:	999
	What answer makes your grace unto my suit?	999
	999
REIGNIER	Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth	999
	To be the princely bride of such a lord;	999
	Upon condition I may quietly	999
	Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,	999
	Free from oppression or the stroke of war,	999
	My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	That is her ransom; I deliver her;	999
	And those two counties I will undertake	999
	Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.	999
	999
REIGNIER	And I again, in Henry's royal name,	999
	As deputy unto that gracious king,	999
	Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,	999
	Because this is in traffic of a king.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	And yet, methinks, I could be well content	999
	To be mine own attorney in this case.	999
	I'll over then to England with this news,	999
	And make this marriage to be solemnized.	999
	So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe	999
	In golden palaces, as it becomes.	999
	999
REIGNIER	I do embrace thee, as I would embrace	999
	The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.	999
	999
MARGARET	Farewell, my lord: good wishes, praise and prayers	999
	Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.	999
	999
	[Going]	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Farewell, sweet madam: but hark you, Margaret;	999
	No princely commendations to my king?	999
	999
MARGARET	Such commendations as becomes a maid,	999
	A virgin and his servant, say to him.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.	999
	But madam, I must trouble you again;	999
	No loving token to his majesty?	999
	999
MARGARET	Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,	999
	Never yet taint with love, I send the king.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	And this withal.	999
	999
	[Kisses her]	999
	999
MARGARET	That for thyself: I will not so presume	999
	To send such peevish tokens to a king.	999
	999
	[Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET]	999
	999
SUFFOLK	O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;	999
	Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;	999
	There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.	999
	Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:	999
	Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,	999
	And natural graces that extinguish art;	999
	Repeat their semblance often on the seas,	999
	That, when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet,	999
	Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.	999

	999
YORK	Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.	999
	999
	[Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE, guarded, and a Shepherd]	999
	999
Shepherd	Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!	999
	Have I sought every country far and near,	999
	And, now it is my chance to find thee out,	999
	Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?	999
	Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!	999
	I am descended of a gentler blood:	999
	Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.	999
	999
Shepherd	Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;	999
	I did beget her, all the parish knows:	999
	Her mother liveth yet, can testify	999
	She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.	999
	999
WARWICK	Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?	999
	999
YORK	This argues what her kind of life hath been,	999
	Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.	999
	999
Shepherd	Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!	999
	God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;	999
	And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:	999
	Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,	999
	Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.	999
	999
Shepherd	'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest	999
	The morn that I was wedded to her mother.	999
	Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.	999
	Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time	999
	Of thy nativity! I would the milk	999
	Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast,	999
	Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!	999
	Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,	999
	I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!	999
	Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?	999
	O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
YORK	Take her away; for she hath lived too long,	999
	To fill the world with vicious qualities.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:	999
	Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,	999
	But issued from the progeny of kings;	999
	Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,	999
	By inspiration of celestial grace,	999
	To work exceeding miracles on earth.	999
	I never had to do with wicked spirits:	999
	But you, that are polluted with your lusts,	999
	Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,	999
	Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,	999
	Because you want the grace that others have,	999
	You judge it straight a thing impossible	999
	To compass wonders but by help of devils.	999
	No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been	999
	A virgin from her tender infancy,	999
	Chaste and immaculate in very thought;	999
	Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,	999
	Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.	999
	999
YORK	Ay, ay: away with her to execution!	999
	999
WARWICK	And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,	999
	Spare for no faggots, let there be enow:	999
	Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,	999
	That so her torture may be shortened.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?	999
	Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,	999
	That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.	999
	I am with child, ye bloody homicides:	999
	Murder not then the fruit within my womb,	999
	Although ye hale me to a violent death.	999
	999
YORK	Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!	999
	999
WARWICK	The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:	999
	Is all your strict preciseness come to this?	999
	999
YORK	She and the Dauphin have been juggling:	999
	I did imagine what would be her refuge.	999
	999
WARWICK	Well, go to; we'll have no bastards live;	999
	Especially since Charles must father it.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	You are deceived; my child is none of his:	999
	It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.	999
	999
YORK	Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!	999
	It dies, an if it had a thousand lives.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	O, give me leave, I have deluded you:	999
	'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,	999
	But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail'd.	999
	999
WARWICK	A married man! that's most intolerable.	999
	999
YORK	Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well,	999
	There were so many, whom she may accuse.	999
	999
WARWICK	It's sign she hath been liberal and free.	999
	999
YORK	And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.	999
	Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee:	999
	Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.	999
	999
JOAN LA PUCELLE	Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:	999
	May never glorious sun reflex his beams	999
	Upon the country where you make abode;	999
	But darkness and the gloomy shade of death	999
	Environ you, till mischief and despair	999
	Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!	999
	999
	[Exit, guarded]	999
	999
YORK	Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,	999
	Thou foul accursed minister of hell!	999
	999
	[Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER, attended]	999
	999
CARDINAL	999
OF WINCHESTER	Lord regent, I do greet your excellence	999
	With letters of commission from the king.	999
	For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,	999
	Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,	999
	Have earnestly implored a general peace	999
	Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;	999
	And here at hand the Dauphin and his train	999
	Approacheth, to confer about some matter.	999
	999
YORK	 Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?	999
	After the slaughter of so many peers,	999
	So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,	999
	That in this quarrel have been overthrown	999
	And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,	999
	Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?	999
	Have we not lost most part of all the towns,	999
	By treason, falsehood and by treachery,	999
	Our great progenitors had conquered?	999
	O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief	999
	The utter loss of all the realm of France.	999
	999
WARWICK	Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,	999
	It shall be with such strict and severe covenants	999
	As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.	999
	999
	[Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS,	999
	REIGNIER, and others]	999
	999
CHARLES	Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed	999
	That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,	999
	We come to be informed by yourselves	999
	What the conditions of that league must be.	999
	999
YORK	Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes	999
	The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,	999
	By sight of these our baleful enemies.	999
	999
CARDINAL	999
OF WINCHESTER	Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:	999
	That, in regard King Henry gives consent,	999
	Of mere compassion and of lenity,	999
	To ease your country of distressful war,	999
	And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,	999
	You shall become true liegemen to his crown:	999
	And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear	999
	To pay him tribute, submit thyself,	999
	Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,	999
	And still enjoy thy regal dignity.	999
	999
ALENCON	Must he be then as shadow of himself?	999
	Adorn his temples with a coronet,	999
	And yet, in substance and authority,	999
	Retain but privilege of a private man?	999
	This proffer is absurd and reasonless.	999
	999
CHARLES	'Tis known already that I am possess'd	999
	With more than half the Gallian territories,	999
	And therein reverenced for their lawful king:	999
	Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,	999
	Detract so much from that prerogative,	999
	As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?	999
	No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep	999
	That which I have than, coveting for more,	999
	Be cast from possibility of all.	999
	999
YORK	Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means	999
	Used intercession to obtain a league,	999
	And, now the matter grows to compromise,	999
	Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?	999
	Either accept the title thou usurp'st,	999
	Of benefit proceeding from our king	999
	And not of any challenge of desert,	999
	Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.	999
	999
REIGNIER	My lord, you do not well in obstinacy	999
	To cavil in the course of this contract:	999
	If once it be neglected, ten to one	999
	We shall not find like opportunity.	999
	999
ALENCON	To say the truth, it is your policy	999
	To save your subjects from such massacre	999
	And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen	999
	By our proceeding in hostility;	999
	And therefore take this compact of a truce,	999
	Although you break it when your pleasure serves.	999
	999
WARWICK	How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?	999
	999
CHARLES	It shall;	999
	Only reserved, you claim no interest	999
	In any of our towns of garrison.	999
	999
YORK	Then swear allegiance to his majesty,	999
	As thou art knight, never to disobey	999
	Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,	999
	Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.	999
	So, now dismiss your army when ye please:	999
	Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,	999
	For here we entertain a solemn peace.	999

	1 KING HENRY VI	999
	999
	999
ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE V	London. The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI,	999
	GLOUCESTER and EXETER]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,	999
	Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:	999
	Her virtues graced with external gifts	999
	Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:	999
	And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts	999
	Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,	999
	So am I driven by breath of her renown	999
	Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive	999
	Where I may have fruition of her love.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale	999
	Is but a preface of her worthy praise;	999
	The chief perfections of that lovely dame	999
	Had I sufficient skill to utter them,	999
	Would make a volume of enticing lines,	999
	Able to ravish any dull conceit:	999
	And, which is more, she is not so divine,	999
	So full-replete with choice of all delights,	999
	But with as humble lowliness of mind	999
	She is content to be at your command;	999
	Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,	999
	To love and honour Henry as her lord.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.	999
	Therefore, my lord protector, give consent	999
	That Margaret may be England's royal queen.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	So should I give consent to flatter sin.	999
	You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd	999
	Unto another lady of esteem:	999
	How shall we then dispense with that contract,	999
	And not deface your honour with reproach?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;	999
	Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd	999
	To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists	999
	By reason of his adversary's odds:	999
	A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,	999
	And therefore may be broke without offence.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?	999
	Her father is no better than an earl,	999
	Although in glorious titles he excel.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Yes, lord, her father is a king,	999
	The King of Naples and Jerusalem;	999
	And of such great authority in France	999
	As his alliance will confirm our peace	999
	And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,	999
	Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.	999
	999
EXETER	Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,	999
	Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,	999
	That he should be so abject, base and poor,	999
	To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.	999
	Henry is able to enrich his queen	999
	And not seek a queen to make him rich:	999
	So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,	999
	As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.	999
	Marriage is a matter of more worth	999
	Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;	999
	Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,	999
	Must be companion of his nuptial bed:	999
	And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,	999
	It most of all these reasons bindeth us,	999
	In our opinions she should be preferr'd.	999
	For what is wedlock forced but a hell,	999
	An age of discord and continual strife?	999
	Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,	999
	And is a pattern of celestial peace.	999
	Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,	999
	But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?	999
	Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,	999
	Approves her fit for none but for a king:	999
	Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,	999
	More than in women commonly is seen,	999
	Will answer our hope in issue of a king;	999
	For Henry, son unto a conqueror,	999
	Is likely to beget more conquerors,	999
	If with a lady of so high resolve	999
	As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.	999
	Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me	999
	That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Whether it be through force of your report,	999
	My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that	999
	My tender youth was never yet attaint	999
	With any passion of inflaming love,	999
	I cannot tell; but this I am assured,	999
	I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,	999
	Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,	999
	As I am sick with working of my thoughts.	999
	Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;	999
	Agree to any covenants, and procure	999
	That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come	999
	To cross the seas to England and be crown'd	999
	King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:	999
	For your expenses and sufficient charge,	999
	Among the people gather up a tenth.	999
	Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,	999
	I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.	999
	And you, good uncle, banish all offence:	999
	If you do censure me by what you were,	999
	Not what you are, I know it will excuse	999
	This sudden execution of my will.	999
	And so, conduct me where, from company,	999
	I may revolve and ruminate my grief.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.	999
	999
	[Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER]	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,	999
	As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,	999
	With hope to find the like event in love,	999
	But prosper better than the Trojan did.	999
	Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;	999
	But I will rule both her, the king and realm.	999

	999
	999
	[Warkworth. Before the castle]	999
	999
	[Enter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues]	999
	999
RUMOUR	Open your ears; for which of you will stop	999
	The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?	999
	I, from the orient to the drooping west,	999
	Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold	999
	The acts commenced on this ball of earth:	999
	Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,	999
	The which in every language I pronounce,	999
	Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.	999
	I speak of peace, while covert enmity	999
	Under the smile of safety wounds the world:	999
	And who but Rumour, who but only I,	999
	Make fearful musters and prepared defence,	999
	Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,	999
	Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,	999
	And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe	999
	Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures	999
	And of so easy and so plain a stop	999
	That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,	999
	The still-discordant wavering multitude,	999
	Can play upon it. But what need I thus	999
	My well-known body to anatomize	999
	Among my household? Why is Rumour here?	999
	I run before King Harry's victory;	999
	Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury	999
	Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,	999
	Quenching the flame of bold rebellion	999
	Even with the rebel's blood. But what mean I	999
	To speak so true at first? my office is	999
	To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell	999
	Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,	999
	And that the king before the Douglas' rage	999
	Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.	999
	This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns	999
	Between that royal field of Shrewsbury	999
	And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,	999
	Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,	999
	Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,	999
	And not a man of them brings other news	999
	Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues	999
	They bring smooth comforts false, worse than	999
	true wrongs.	999

LORD BARDOLPH	Tell thou the earl	999
	That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.	999
	999
Porter	His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard;	999
	Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,	999
	And he himself wilt answer.	999
	999
	[Enter NORTHUMBERLAND]	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	Here comes the earl.	999
	999
	[Exit Porter]	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now	999
	Should be the father of some stratagem:	999
	The times are wild: contention, like a horse	999
	Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose	999
	And bears down all before him.	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	Noble earl,	999
	I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Good, an God will!	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	                  As good as heart can wish:	999
	The king is almost wounded to the death;	999
	And, in the fortune of my lord your son,	999
	Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts	999
	Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John	999
	And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;	999
	And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,	999
	Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,	999
	So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,	999
	Came not till now to dignify the times,	999
	Since Caesar's fortunes!	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	How is this derived?	999
	Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,	999
	A gentleman well bred and of good name,	999
	That freely render'd me these news for true.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent	999
	On Tuesday last to listen after news.	999
	999
	[Enter TRAVERS]	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	My lord, I over-rode him on the way;	999
	And he is furnish'd with no certainties	999
	More than he haply may retail from me.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?	999
	999
TRAVERS	My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back	999
	With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,	999
	Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard	999
	A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,	999
	That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.	999
	He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him	999
	I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:	999
	He told me that rebellion had bad luck	999
	And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.	999
	With that, he gave his able horse the head,	999
	And bending forward struck his armed heels	999
	Against the panting sides of his poor jade	999
	Up to the rowel-head, and starting so	999
	He seem'd in running to devour the way,	999
	Staying no longer question.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Ha! Again:	999
	Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?	999
	Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion	999
	Had met ill luck?	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	                  My lord, I'll tell you what;	999
	If my young lord your son have not the day,	999
	Upon mine honour, for a silken point	999
	I'll give my barony: never talk of it.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers	999
	Give then such instances of loss?	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	Who, he?	999
	He was some hilding fellow that had stolen	999
	The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,	999
	Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.	999
	999
	[Enter MORTON]	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,	999
	Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:	999
	So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood	999
	Hath left a witness'd usurpation.	999
	Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?	999
	999
MORTON	I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;	999
	Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask	999
	To fright our party.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	How doth my son and brother?	999
	Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek	999
	Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.	999
	Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,	999
	So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,	999
	Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,	999
	And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;	999
	But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,	999
	And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.	999
	This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;	999
	Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'	999
	Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:	999
	But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,	999
	Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,	999
	Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'	999
	999
MORTON	Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;	999
	But, for my lord your son--	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Why, he is dead.	999
	See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!	999
	He that but fears the thing he would not know	999
	Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes	999
	That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;	999
	Tell thou an earl his divination lies,	999
	And I will take it as a sweet disgrace	999
	And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.	999
	999
MORTON	You are too great to be by me gainsaid:	999
	Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.	999
	I see a strange confession in thine eye:	999
	Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin	999
	To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;	999
	The tongue offends not that reports his death:	999
	And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,	999
	Not he which says the dead is not alive.	999
	Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news	999
	Hath but a losing office, and his tongue	999
	Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,	999
	Remember'd tolling a departing friend.	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.	999
	999
MORTON	I am sorry I should force you to believe	999
	That which I would to God I had not seen;	999
	But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,	999
	Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,	999
	To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down	999
	The never-daunted Percy to the earth,	999
	From whence with life he never more sprung up.	999
	In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire	999
	Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,	999
	Being bruited once, took fire and heat away	999
	From the best temper'd courage in his troops;	999
	For from his metal was his party steel'd;	999
	Which once in him abated, all the rest	999
	Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:	999
	And as the thing that's heavy in itself,	999
	Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,	999
	So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,	999
	Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear	999
	That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim	999
	Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,	999
	Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester	999
	Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,	999
	The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword	999
	Had three times slain the appearance of the king,	999
	'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame	999
	Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,	999
	Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all	999
	Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out	999
	A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,	999
	Under the conduct of young Lancaster	999
	And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	For this I shall have time enough to mourn.	999
	In poison there is physic; and these news,	999
	Having been well, that would have made me sick,	999
	Being sick, have in some measure made me well:	999
	And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,	999
	Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,	999
	Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire	999
	Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,	999
	Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,	999
	Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!	999
	A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel	999
	Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!	999
	Thou art a guard too wanton for the head	999
	Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.	999
	Now bind my brows with iron; and approach	999
	The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring	999
	To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!	999
	Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand	999
	Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!	999
	And let this world no longer be a stage	999
	To feed contention in a lingering act;	999
	But let one spirit of the first-born Cain	999
	Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set	999
	On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,	999
	And darkness be the burier of the dead!	999
	999
TRAVERS	This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.	999
	999
MORTON	The lives of all your loving complices	999
	Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er	999
	To stormy passion, must perforce decay.	999
	You cast the event of war, my noble lord,	999
	And summ'd the account of chance, before you said	999
	'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,	999
	That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:	999
	You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,	999
	More likely to fall in than to get o'er;	999
	You were advised his flesh was capable	999
	Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit	999
	Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:	999
	Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,	999
	Though strongly apprehended, could restrain	999
	The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,	999
	Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,	999
	More than that being which was like to be?	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	We all that are engaged to this loss	999
	Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas	999
	That if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;	999
	And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed	999
	Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;	999
	And since we are o'erset, venture again.	999
	Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.	999
	999
MORTON	'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,	999
	I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,	999
	The gentle Archbishop of York is up	999
	With well-appointed powers: he is a man	999
	Who with a double surety binds his followers.	999
	My lord your son had only but the corpse,	999
	But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;	999
	For that same word, rebellion, did divide	999
	The action of their bodies from their souls;	999
	And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,	999
	As men drink potions, that their weapons only	999
	Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,	999
	This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,	999
	As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop	999
	Turns insurrection to religion:	999
	Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,	999
	He's followed both with body and with mind;	999
	And doth enlarge his rising with the blood	999
	Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;	999
	Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;	999
	Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,	999
	Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;	999
	And more and less do flock to follow him.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,	999
	This present grief had wiped it from my mind.	999
	Go in with me; and counsel every man	999
	The aptest way for safety and revenge:	999
	Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:	999
	Never so few, and never yet more need.	999

	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	London. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF, with his Page bearing his sword	999
	and buckler]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?	999
	999
Page	He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy	999
	water; but, for the party that owed it, he might	999
	have more diseases than he knew for.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the	999
	brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not	999
	able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more	999
	than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only	999
	witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other	999
	men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that	999
	hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the	999
	prince put thee into my service for any other reason	999
	than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.	999
	Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn	999
	in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never	999
	manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you	999
	neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and	999
	send you back again to your master, for a jewel,--	999
	the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is	999
	not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in	999
	the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his	999
	cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is	999
	a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis	999
	not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a	999
	face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence	999
	out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had	999
	writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He	999
	may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,	999
	I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about	999
	the satin for my short cloak and my slops?	999
	999
Page	He said, sir, you should procure him better	999
	assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his	999
	band and yours; he liked not the security.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his	999
	tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally	999
	yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,	999
	and then stand upon security! The whoreson	999
	smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and	999
	bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is	999
	through with them in honest taking up, then they	999
	must stand upon security. I had as lief they would	999
	put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with	999
	security. I looked a' should have sent me two and	999
	twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he	999
	sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;	999
	for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness	999
	of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he	999
	see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.	999
	Where's Bardolph?	999
	999
Page	He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in	999
	Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the	999
	stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.	999
	999
	[Enter the Lord Chief-Justice and Servant]	999
	999
Page	Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the	999
	Prince for striking him about Bardolph.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Wait, close; I will not see him.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	What's he that goes there?	999
	999
Servant	Falstaff, an't please your lordship.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	He that was in question for the robbery?	999
	999
Servant	He, my lord: but he hath since done good service at	999
	Shrewsbury; and, as I hear, is now going with some	999
	charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	What, to York? Call him back again.	999
	999
Servant	Sir John Falstaff!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Boy, tell him I am deaf.	999
	999
Page	You must speak louder; my master is deaf.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.	999
	Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him.	999
	999
Servant	Sir John!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not	999
	wars? is there not employment? doth not the king	999
	lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?	999
	Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it	999
	is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,	999
	were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell	999
	how to make it.	999
	999
Servant	You mistake me, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting	999
	my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied	999
	in my throat, if I had said so.	999
	999
Servant	I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our	999
	soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you,	999
	you lie in your throat, if you say I am any other	999
	than an honest man.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that	999
	which grows to me! if thou gettest any leave of me,	999
	hang me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be	999
	hanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt!	999
	999
Servant	Sir, my lord would speak with you.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My good lord! God give your lordship good time of	999
	day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard	999
	say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship	999
	goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not	999
	clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in	999
	you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must	999
	humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care	999
	of your health.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to	999
	Shrewsbury.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is	999
	returned with some discomfort from Wales.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when	999
	I sent for you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into	999
	this same whoreson apoplexy.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with	999
	you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,	999
	an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the	999
	blood, a whoreson tingling.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	What tell you me of it? be it as it is.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	It hath its original from much grief, from study and	999
	perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of	999
	his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	I think you are fallen into the disease; for you	999
	hear not what I say to you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please	999
	you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady	999
	of not marking, that I am troubled withal.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	To punish you by the heels would amend the	999
	attention of your ears; and I care not if I do	999
	become your physician.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:	999
	your lordship may minister the potion of	999
	imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how	999
	should I be your patient to follow your	999
	prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a	999
	scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	I sent for you, when there were matters against you	999
	for your life, to come speak with me.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the	999
	laws of this land-service, I did not come.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I would it were otherwise; I would my means were	999
	greater, and my waist slenderer.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	You have misled the youthful prince.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow	999
	with the great belly, and he my dog.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your	999
	day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded	999
	over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may	999
	thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting	999
	that action.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My lord?	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a	999
	sleeping wolf.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt	999
	out.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say	999
	of wax, my growth would approve the truth.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	There is not a white hair on your face but should	999
	have his effect of gravity.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	You follow the young prince up and down, like his	999
	ill angel.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope	999
	he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:	999
	and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I	999
	cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these	999
	costermonger times that true valour is turned	999
	bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath	999
	his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the	999
	other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of	999
	this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.	999
	You that are old consider not the capacities of us	999
	that are young; you do measure the heat of our	999
	livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we	999
	that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,	999
	are wags too.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,	999
	that are written down old with all the characters of	999
	age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a	999
	yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an	999
	increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your	999
	wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and	999
	every part about you blasted with antiquity? and	999
	will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the	999
	afternoon, with a white head and something a round	999
	belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing	999
	and singing of anthems. To approve my youth	999
	further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in	999
	judgment and understanding; and he that will caper	999
	with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the	999
	money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that	999
	the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,	999
	and you took it like a sensible lord. I have	999
	chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;	999
	marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk	999
	and old sack.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Well, God send the prince a better companion!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	God send the companion a better prince! I cannot	999
	rid my hands of him.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I	999
	hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster	999
	against the Archbishop and the Earl of	999
	Northumberland.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look	999
	you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,	999
	that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the	999
	Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean	999
	not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,	999
	and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I	999
	might never spit white again. There is not a	999
	dangerous action can peep out his head but I am	999
	thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it	999
	was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if	999
	they have a good thing, to make it too common. If	999
	ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give	999
	me rest. I would to God my name were not so	999
	terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be	999
	eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to	999
	nothing with perpetual motion.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your	999
	expedition!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to	999
	furnish me forth?	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to	999
	bear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to my	999
	cousin Westmoreland.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Chief-Justice and Servant]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man	999
	can no more separate age and covetousness than a'	999
	can part young limbs and lechery: but the gout	999
	galls the one, and the pox pinches the other; and	999
	so both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!	999
	999
Page	Sir?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What money is in my purse?	999
	999
Page	Seven groats and two pence.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I can get no remedy against this consumption of the	999
	purse: borrowing only lingers and lingers it out,	999
	but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter	999
	to my Lord of Lancaster; this to the prince; this	999
	to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old	999
	Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry	999
	since I perceived the first white hair on my chin.	999
	About it: you know where to find me.	999
	999
	[Exit Page]	999
	999
	A pox of this gout! or, a gout of this pox! for	999
	the one or the other plays the rogue with my great	999
	toe. 'Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the wars	999
	for my colour, and my pension shall seem the more	999
	reasonable. A good wit will make use of any thing:	999
	I will turn diseases to commodity.	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE III	York. The Archbishop's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the Lords HASTINGS,	999
	MOWBRAY, and BARDOLPH]	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;	999
	And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,	999
	Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:	999
	And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?	999
	999
MOWBRAY	I well allow the occasion of our arms;	999
	But gladly would be better satisfied	999
	How in our means we should advance ourselves	999
	To look with forehead bold and big enough	999
	Upon the power and puissance of the king.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Our present musters grow upon the file	999
	To five and twenty thousand men of choice;	999
	And our supplies live largely in the hope	999
	Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns	999
	With an incensed fire of injuries.	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;	999
	Whether our present five and twenty thousand	999
	May hold up head without Northumberland?	999
	999
HASTINGS	With him, we may.	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	                  Yea, marry, there's the point:	999
	But if without him we be thought too feeble,	999
	My judgment is, we should not step too far	999
	Till we had his assistance by the hand;	999
	For in a theme so bloody-faced as this	999
	Conjecture, expectation, and surmise	999
	Of aids incertain should not be admitted.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed	999
	It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,	999
	Eating the air on promise of supply,	999
	Flattering himself in project of a power	999
	Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:	999
	And so, with great imagination	999
	Proper to madmen, led his powers to death	999
	And winking leap'd into destruction.	999
	999
HASTINGS	But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt	999
	To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	Yes, if this present quality of war,	999
	Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot	999
	Lives so in hope as in an early spring	999
	We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,	999
	Hope gives not so much warrant as despair	999
	That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,	999
	We first survey the plot, then draw the model;	999
	And when we see the figure of the house,	999
	Then must we rate the cost of the erection;	999
	Which if we find outweighs ability,	999
	What do we then but draw anew the model	999
	In fewer offices, or at last desist	999
	To build at all? Much more, in this great work,	999
	Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down	999
	And set another up, should we survey	999
	The plot of situation and the model,	999
	Consent upon a sure foundation,	999
	Question surveyors, know our own estate,	999
	How able such a work to undergo,	999
	To weigh against his opposite; or else	999
	We fortify in paper and in figures,	999
	Using the names of men instead of men:	999
	Like one that draws the model of a house	999
	Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,	999
	Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost	999
	A naked subject to the weeping clouds	999
	And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,	999
	Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd	999
	The utmost man of expectation,	999
	I think we are a body strong enough,	999
	Even as we are, to equal with the king.	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?	999
	999
HASTINGS	To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.	999
	For his divisions, as the times do brawl,	999
	Are in three heads: one power against the French,	999
	And one against Glendower; perforce a third	999
	Must take up us: so is the unfirm king	999
	In three divided; and his coffers sound	999
	With hollow poverty and emptiness.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	That he should draw his several strengths together	999
	And come against us in full puissance,	999
	Need not be dreaded.	999
	999
HASTINGS	If he should do so,	999
	He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh	999
	Baying him at the heels: never fear that.	999
	999
LORD BARDOLPH	Who is it like should lead his forces hither?	999
	999
HASTINGS	The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;	999
	Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:	999
	But who is substituted 'gainst the French,	999
	I have no certain notice.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Let us on,	999
	And publish the occasion of our arms.	999
	The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;	999
	Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:	999
	An habitation giddy and unsure	999
	Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.	999
	O thou fond many, with what loud applause	999
	Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,	999
	Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!	999
	And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,	999
	Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,	999
	That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.	999
	So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge	999
	Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;	999
	And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,	999
	And howl'st to find it. What trust is in	999
	these times?	999
	They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,	999
	Are now become enamour'd on his grave:	999
	Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head	999
	When through proud London he came sighing on	999
	After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,	999
	Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,	999
	And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed!	999
	Past and to come seems best; things present worst.	999
	999
MOWBRAY	Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?	999
	999
HASTINGS	We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	London. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, FANG and his Boy with her,	999
	and SNARE following.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Master Fang, have you entered the action?	999
	999
FANG	It is entered.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Where's your yeoman? Is't a lusty yeoman? will a'	999
	stand to 't?	999
	999
FANG	Sirrah, where's Snare?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.	999
	999
SNARE	Here, here.	999
	999
FANG	Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Yea, good Master Snare; I have entered him and all.	999
	999
SNARE	It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me in	999
	mine own house, and that most beastly: in good	999
	faith, he cares not what mischief he does. If his	999
	weapon be out: he will foin like any devil; he will	999
	spare neither man, woman, nor child.	999
	999
FANG	If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	No, nor I neither: I'll be at your elbow.	999
	999
FANG	An I but fist him once; an a' come but within my vice,--	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he's an	999
	infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang,	999
	hold him sure: good Master Snare, let him not	999
	'scape. A' comes continuantly to Pie-corner--saving	999
	your manhoods--to buy a saddle; and he is indited to	999
	dinner to the Lubber's-head in Lumbert street, to	999
	Master Smooth's the silkman: I pray ye, since my	999
	exion is entered and my case so openly known to the	999
	world, let him be brought in to his answer. A	999
	hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to	999
	bear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and	999
	have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed	999
	off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame	999
	to be thought on. There is no honesty in such	999
	dealing; unless a woman should be made an ass and a	999
	beast, to bear every knave's wrong. Yonder he	999
	comes; and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph,	999
	with him. Do your offices, do your offices: Master	999
	Fang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF, Page, and BARDOLPH]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	How now! whose mare's dead? what's the matter?	999
	999
FANG	Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph: cut me off the	999
	villain's head: throw the quean in the channel.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Throw me in the channel! I'll throw thee in the	999
	channel. Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly	999
	rogue! Murder, murder! Ah, thou honeysuckle	999
	villain! wilt thou kill God's officers and the	999
	king's? Ah, thou honey-seed rogue! thou art a	999
	honey-seed, a man-queller, and a woman-queller.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Keep them off, Bardolph.	999
	999
FANG	A rescue! a rescue!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Good people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wo't, wo't	999
	thou? Thou wo't, wo't ta? do, do, thou rogue! do,	999
	thou hemp-seed!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Away, you scullion! you rampallion! You	999
	fustilarian! I'll tickle your catastrophe.	999
	999
	[Enter the Lord Chief-Justice, and his men]	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	What is the matter? keep the peace here, ho!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you, stand to me.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	How now, Sir John! what are you brawling here?	999
	Doth this become your place, your time and business?	999
	You should have been well on your way to York.	999
	Stand from him, fellow: wherefore hang'st upon him?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	O most worshipful lord, an't please your grace, I am	999
	a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	For what sum?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all,	999
	all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home;	999
	he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of	999
	his: but I will have some of it out again, or I	999
	will ride thee o' nights like the mare.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I have	999
	any vantage of ground to get up.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	How comes this, Sir John? Fie! what man of good	999
	temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?	999
	Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so	999
	rough a course to come by her own?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What is the gross sum that I owe thee?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the	999
	money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a	999
	parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber,	999
	at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon	999
	Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince broke	999
	thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of	999
	Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was	999
	washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady	999
	thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife	999
	Keech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call me	999
	gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of	999
	vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns;	999
	whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby I	999
	told thee they were ill for a green wound? And	999
	didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs,	999
	desire me to be no more so familiarity with such	999
	poor people; saying that ere long they should call	999
	me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me	999
	fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy	999
	book-oath: deny it, if thou canst.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My lord, this is a poor mad soul; and she says up	999
	and down the town that the eldest son is like you:	999
	she hath been in good case, and the truth is,	999
	poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish	999
	officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your	999
	manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It	999
	is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words	999
	that come with such more than impudent sauciness	999
	from you, can thrust me from a level consideration:	999
	you have, as it appears to me, practised upon the	999
	easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her	999
	serve your uses both in purse and in person.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Yea, in truth, my lord.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and	999
	unpay the villany you have done her: the one you	999
	may do with sterling money, and the other with	999
	current repentance.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without	999
	reply. You call honourable boldness impudent	999
	sauciness: if a man will make courtesy and say	999
	nothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humble	999
	duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say	999
	to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,	999
	being upon hasty employment in the king's affairs.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	You speak as having power to do wrong: but answer	999
	in the effect of your reputation, and satisfy this	999
	poor woman.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Come hither, hostess.	999
	999
	[Enter GOWER]	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Now, Master Gower, what news?	999
	999
GOWER	The king, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales	999
	Are near at hand: the rest the paper tells.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	As I am a gentleman.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Faith, you said so before.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	As I am a gentleman. Come, no more words of it.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain	999
	to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my	999
	dining-chambers.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Glasses, glasses is the only drinking: and for thy	999
	walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of	999
	the Prodigal, or the German hunting in water-work,	999
	is worth a thousand of these bed-hangings and these	999
	fly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten pound, if thou	999
	canst. Come, an 'twere not for thy humours, there's	999
	not a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face,	999
	and draw the action. Come, thou must not be in	999
	this humour with me; dost not know me? come, come, I	999
	know thou wast set on to this.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles: i'	999
	faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me,	999
	la!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Let it alone; I'll make other shift: you'll be a	999
	fool still.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown. I	999
	hope you'll come to supper. You'll pay me all together?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Will I live?	999
	999
	[To BARDOLPH]	999
	999
	Go, with her, with her; hook on, hook on.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No more words; let's have her.	999
	999
	[Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY, BARDOLPH, Officers and Boy]	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	I have heard better news.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What's the news, my lord?	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Where lay the king last night?	999
	999
GOWER	At Basingstoke, my lord.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I hope, my lord, all's well: what is the news, my lord?	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Come all his forces back?	999
	999
GOWER	No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,	999
	Are marched up to my lord of Lancaster,	999
	Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Comes the king back from Wales, my noble lord?	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	You shall have letters of me presently:	999
	Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My lord!	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	What's the matter?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?	999
	999
GOWER	I must wait upon my good lord here; I thank you,	999
	good Sir John.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are to	999
	take soldiers up in counties as you go.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Will you sup with me, Master Gower?	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir John?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool	999
	that taught them me. This is the right fencing	999
	grace, my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Now the Lord lighten thee! thou art a great fool.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	London. Another street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Before God, I am exceeding weary.	999
	999
POINS	Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not	999
	have attached one of so high blood.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Faith, it does me; though it discolours the	999
	complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth	999
	it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?	999
	999
POINS	Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as	999
	to remember so weak a composition.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,	999
	by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,	999
	small beer. But, indeed, these humble	999
	considerations make me out of love with my	999
	greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember	999
	thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to	999
	take note how many pair of silk stockings thou	999
	hast, viz. these, and those that were thy	999
	peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy	999
	shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for	999
	use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better	999
	than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when	999
	thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done	999
	a great while, because the rest of thy low	999
	countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:	999
	and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins	999
	of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the	999
	midwives say the children are not in the fault;	999
	whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are	999
	mightily strengthened.	999
	999
POINS	How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,	999
	you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good	999
	young princes would do so, their fathers being so	999
	sick as yours at this time is?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?	999
	999
POINS	Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.	999
	999
POINS	Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you	999
	will tell.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be	999
	sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell	999
	thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a	999
	better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad	999
	indeed too.	999
	999
POINS	Very hardly upon such a subject.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's	999
	book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and	999
	persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell	999
	thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so	999
	sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art	999
	hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.	999
	999
POINS	The reason?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?	999
	999
POINS	I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	It would be every man's thought; and thou art a	999
	blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never	999
	a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way	999
	better than thine: every man would think me an	999
	hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most	999
	worshipful thought to think so?	999
	999
POINS	Why, because you have been so lewd and so much	999
	engraffed to Falstaff.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	And to thee.	999
	999
POINS	By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it	999
	with my own ears: the worst that they can say of	999
	me is that I am a second brother and that I am a	999
	proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I	999
	confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.	999
	999
	[Enter BARDOLPH and Page]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	And the boy that I gave Falstaff: a' had him from	999
	me Christian; and look, if the fat villain have not	999
	transformed him ape.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	God save your grace!	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	And yours, most noble Bardolph!	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you	999
	be blushing? wherefore blush you now? What a	999
	maidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is't such a	999
	matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?	999
	999
Page	A' calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red	999
	lattice, and I could discern no part of his face	999
	from the window: at last I spied his eyes, and	999
	methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife's	999
	new petticoat and so peeped through.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Has not the boy profited?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!	999
	999
Page	Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?	999
	999
Page	Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was delivered	999
	of a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	A crown's worth of good interpretation: there 'tis,	999
	boy.	999
	999
POINS	O, that this good blossom could be kept from	999
	cankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	An you do not make him hanged among you, the	999
	gallows shall have wrong.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	And how doth thy master, Bardolph?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Well, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming to	999
	town: there's a letter for you.	999
	999
POINS	Delivered with good respect. And how doth the	999
	martlemas, your master?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	In bodily health, sir.	999
	999
POINS	Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; but	999
	that moves not him: though that be sick, it dies	999
	not.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my	999
	dog; and he holds his place; for look you how be writes.	999
	999
POINS	[Reads]  'John Falstaff, knight,'--every man must	999
	know that, as oft as he has occasion to name	999
	himself: even like those that are kin to the king;	999
	for they never prick their finger but they say,	999
	'There's some of the king's blood spilt.' 'How	999
	comes that?' says he, that takes upon him not to	999
	conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower's	999
	cap, 'I am the king's poor cousin, sir.'	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it	999
	from Japhet. But to the letter.	999
	999
POINS	[Reads]  'Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son of	999
	the king, nearest his father, Harry Prince of	999
	Wales, greeting.' Why, this is a certificate.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Peace!	999
	999
POINS	[Reads]  'I will imitate the honourable Romans in	999
	brevity:' he sure means brevity in breath,	999
	short-winded. 'I commend me to thee, I commend	999
	thee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with	999
	Poins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that he	999
	swears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repent	999
	at idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.	999
	Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as to	999
	say, as thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with my	999
	familiars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters,	999
	and SIR JOHN with all Europe.'	999
	My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do	999
	you use me thus, Ned? must I marry your sister?	999
	999
POINS	God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the	999
	spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.	999
	Is your master here in London?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Yea, my lord.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Where sups he? doth the old boar feed in the old frank?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What company?	999
	999
Page	Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Sup any women with him?	999
	999
Page	None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and	999
	Mistress Doll Tearsheet.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	What pagan may that be?	999
	999
Page	A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town	999
	bull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?	999
	999
POINS	I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your	999
	master that I am yet come to town: there's for	999
	your silence.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	I have no tongue, sir.	999
	999
Page	And for mine, sir, I will govern it.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Fare you well; go.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page]	999
	999
	This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.	999
	999
POINS	I warrant you, as common as the way between Saint	999
	Alban's and London.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night	999
	in his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?	999
	999
POINS	Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait	999
	upon him at his table as drawers.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	From a God to a bull? a heavy decension! it was	999
	Jove's case. From a prince to a prentice? a low	999
	transformation! that shall be mine; for in every	999
	thing the purpose must weigh with the folly.	999
	Follow me, Ned.	999

SCENE III	Warkworth. Before the castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter NORTHUMBERLAND, LADY NORTHUMBERLAND, and LADY PERCY]	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,	999
	Give even way unto my rough affairs:	999
	Put not you on the visage of the times	999
	And be like them to Percy troublesome.	999
	999
LADY	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	I have given over, I will speak no more:	999
	Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;	999
	And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	O yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!	999
	The time was, father, that you broke your word,	999
	When you were more endeared to it than now;	999
	When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,	999
	Threw many a northward look to see his father	999
	Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.	999
	Who then persuaded you to stay at home?	999
	There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.	999
	For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!	999
	For his, it stuck upon him as the sun	999
	In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light	999
	Did all the chivalry of England move	999
	To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass	999
	Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:	999
	He had no legs that practised not his gait;	999
	And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,	999
	Became the accents of the valiant;	999
	For those that could speak low and tardily	999
	Would turn their own perfection to abuse,	999
	To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,	999
	In diet, in affections of delight,	999
	In military rules, humours of blood,	999
	He was the mark and glass, copy and book,	999
	That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous him!	999
	O miracle of men! him did you leave,	999
	Second to none, unseconded by you,	999
	To look upon the hideous god of war	999
	In disadvantage; to abide a field	999
	Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name	999
	Did seem defensible: so you left him.	999
	Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong	999
	To hold your honour more precise and nice	999
	With others than with him! let them alone:	999
	The marshal and the archbishop are strong:	999
	Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,	999
	To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,	999
	Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Beshrew your heart,	999
	Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me	999
	With new lamenting ancient oversights.	999
	But I must go and meet with danger there,	999
	Or it will seek me in another place	999
	And find me worse provided.	999
	999
LADY	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	O, fly to Scotland,	999
	Till that the nobles and the armed commons	999
	Have of their puissance made a little taste.	999
	999
LADY PERCY	If they get ground and vantage of the king,	999
	Then join you with them, like a rib of steel,	999
	To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,	999
	First let them try themselves. So did your son;	999
	He was so suffer'd: so came I a widow;	999
	And never shall have length of life enough	999
	To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,	999
	That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,	999
	For recordation to my noble husband.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind	999
	As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,	999
	That makes a still-stand, running neither way:	999
	Fain would I go to meet the archbishop,	999
	But many thousand reasons hold me back.	999
	I will resolve for Scotland: there am I,	999
	Till time and vantage crave my company.	999

	999
SCENE IV	London. The Boar's-head Tavern in Eastcheap.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter two Drawers]	999
	999
First Drawer	What the devil hast thou brought there? apple-johns?	999
	thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an apple-john.	999
	999
Second Drawer	Mass, thou sayest true. The prince once set a dish	999
	of apple-johns before him, and told him there were	999
	five more Sir Johns, and, putting off his hat, said	999
	'I will now take my leave of these six dry, round,	999
	old, withered knights.' It angered him to the	999
	heart: but he hath forgot that.	999
	999
First Drawer	Why, then, cover, and set them down: and see if	999
	thou canst find out Sneak's noise; Mistress	999
	Tearsheet would fain hear some music. Dispatch: the	999
	room where they supped is too hot; they'll come in straight.	999
	999
Second Drawer	Sirrah, here will be the prince and Master Poins	999
	anon; and they will put on two of our jerkins and	999
	aprons; and Sir John must not know of it: Bardolph	999
	hath brought word.	999
	999
First Drawer	By the mass, here will be old Utis: it will be an	999
	excellent stratagem.	999
	999
Second Drawer	I'll see if I can find out Sneak.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	I' faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an	999
	excellent good temperality: your pulsidge beats as	999
	extraordinarily as heart would desire; and your	999
	colour, I warrant you, is as red as any rose, in good	999
	truth, la! But, i' faith, you have drunk too much	999
	canaries; and that's a marvellous searching wine,	999
	and it perfumes the blood ere one can say 'What's	999
	this?' How do you now?	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Better than I was: hem!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Why, that's well said; a good heart's worth gold.	999
	Lo, here comes Sir John.	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	[Singing]  'When Arthur first in court,'	999
	--Empty the jordan.	999
	999
	[Exit First Drawer]	999
	999
	[Singing]	999
	999
	--'And was a worthy king.' How now, Mistress Doll!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Sick of a calm; yea, good faith.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	So is all her sect; an they be once in a calm, they are sick.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	You muddy rascal, is that all the comfort you give me?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	I make them! gluttony and diseases make them; I	999
	make them not.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	If the cook help to make the gluttony, you help to	999
	make the diseases, Doll: we catch of you, Doll, we	999
	catch of you; grant that, my poor virtue grant that.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Your broaches, pearls, and ouches:' for to serve	999
	bravely is to come halting off, you know: to come	999
	off the breach with his pike bent bravely, and to	999
	surgery bravely; to venture upon the charged	999
	chambers bravely,--	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	By my troth, this is the old fashion; you two never	999
	meet but you fall to some discord: you are both,	999
	i' good truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts; you	999
	cannot one bear with another's confirmities. What	999
	the good-year! one must bear, and that must be	999
	you: you are the weaker vessel, as they say, the	999
	emptier vessel.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full	999
	hogshead? there's a whole merchant's venture of	999
	Bourdeaux stuff in him; you have not seen a hulk	999
	better stuffed in the hold. Come, I'll be friends	999
	with thee, Jack: thou art going to the wars; and	999
	whether I shall ever see thee again or no, there is	999
	nobody cares.	999
	999
	[Re-enter First Drawer]	999
	999
First Drawer	Sir, Ancient Pistol's below, and would speak with	999
	you.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Hang him, swaggering rascal! let him not come	999
	hither: it is the foul-mouthed'st rogue in England.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	If he swagger, let him not come here: no, by my	999
	faith; I must live among my neighbours: I'll no	999
	swaggerers: I am in good name and fame with the	999
	very best: shut the door; there comes no swaggerers	999
	here: I have not lived all this while, to have	999
	swaggering now: shut the door, I pray you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear, hostess?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Pray ye, pacify yourself, Sir John: there comes no	999
	swaggerers here.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear? it is mine ancient.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Tilly-fally, Sir John, ne'er tell me: your ancient	999
	swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was before Master	999
	Tisick, the debuty, t'other day; and, as he said to	999
	me, 'twas no longer ago than Wednesday last, 'I'	999
	good faith, neighbour Quickly,' says he; Master	999
	Dumbe, our minister, was by then; 'neighbour	999
	Quickly,' says he, 'receive those that are civil;	999
	for,' said he, 'you are in an ill name:' now a'	999
	said so, I can tell whereupon; 'for,' says he, 'you	999
	are an honest woman, and well thought on; therefore	999
	take heed what guests you receive: receive,' says	999
	he, 'no swaggering companions.' There comes none	999
	here: you would bless you to hear what he said:	999
	no, I'll no swaggerers.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	He's no swaggerer, hostess; a tame cheater, i'	999
	faith; you may stroke him as gently as a puppy	999
	greyhound: he'll not swagger with a Barbary hen, if	999
	her feathers turn back in any show of resistance.	999
	Call him up, drawer.	999
	999
	[Exit First Drawer]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Cheater, call you him? I will bar no honest man my	999
	house, nor no cheater: but I do not love	999
	swaggering, by my troth; I am the worse, when one	999
	says swagger: feel, masters, how I shake; look you,	999
	I warrant you.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	So you do, hostess.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Do I? yea, in very truth, do I, an 'twere an aspen	999
	leaf: I cannot abide swaggerers.	999
	999
	[Enter PISTOL, BARDOLPH, and Page]	999
	999
PISTOL	God save you, Sir John!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I charge	999
	you with a cup of sack: do you discharge upon mine hostess.	999
	999
PISTOL	I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two bullets.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	She is Pistol-proof, sir; you shall hardly offend	999
	her.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Come, I'll drink no proofs nor no bullets: I'll	999
	drink no more than will do me good, for no man's	999
	pleasure, I.	999
	999
PISTOL	Then to you, Mistress Dorothy; I will charge you.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Charge me! I scorn you, scurvy companion. What!	999
	you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen	999
	mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away! I am meat for	999
	your master.	999
	999
PISTOL	I know you, Mistress Dorothy.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Away, you cut-purse rascal! you filthy bung, away!	999
	by this wine, I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy	999
	chaps, an you play the saucy cuttle with me. Away,	999
	you bottle-ale rascal! you basket-hilt stale	999
	juggler, you! Since when, I pray you, sir? God's	999
	light, with two points on your shoulder? much!	999
	999
PISTOL	God let me not live, but I will murder your ruff for this.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No more, Pistol; I would not have you go off here:	999
	discharge yourself of our company, Pistol.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	No, Good Captain Pistol; not here, sweet captain.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Captain! thou abominable damned cheater, art thou	999
	not ashamed to be called captain? An captains were	999
	of my mind, they would truncheon you out, for	999
	taking their names upon you before you have earned	999
	them. You a captain! you slave, for what? for	999
	tearing a poor whore's ruff in a bawdy-house? He a	999
	captain! hang him, rogue! he lives upon mouldy	999
	stewed prunes and dried cakes. A captain! God's	999
	light, these villains will make the word as odious	999
	as the word 'occupy;' which was an excellent good	999
	word before it was ill sorted: therefore captains	999
	had need look to 't.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Pray thee, go down, good ancient.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.	999
	999
PISTOL	Not I	I tell thee what, Corporal Bardolph, I could	999
	tear her: I'll be revenged of her.	999
	999
Page	Pray thee, go down.	999
	999
PISTOL	I'll see her damned first; to Pluto's damned lake,	999
	by this hand, to the infernal deep, with Erebus and	999
	tortures vile also. Hold hook and line, say I.	999
	Down, down, dogs! down, faitors! Have we not	999
	Hiren here?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Good Captain Peesel, be quiet; 'tis very late, i'	999
	faith: I beseek you now, aggravate your choler.	999
	999
PISTOL	These be good humours, indeed! Shall pack-horses	999
	And hollow pamper'd jades of Asia,	999
	Which cannot go but thirty mile a-day,	999
	Compare with Caesars, and with Cannibals,	999
	And Trojan Greeks? nay, rather damn them with	999
	King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar.	999
	Shall we fall foul for toys?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	By my troth, captain, these are very bitter words.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Be gone, good ancient: this will grow to abrawl anon.	999
	999
PISTOL	Die men like dogs! give crowns like pins! Have we	999
	not Heren here?	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	O' my word, captain, there's none such here. What	999
	the good-year! do you think I would deny her? For	999
	God's sake, be quiet.	999
	999
PISTOL	Then feed, and be fat, my fair Calipolis.	999
	Come, give's some sack.	999
	'Si fortune me tormente, sperato me contento.'	999
	Fear we broadsides? no, let the fiend give fire:	999
	Give me some sack: and, sweetheart, lie thou there.	999
	999
	[Laying down his sword]	999
	999
	Come we to full points here; and are etceteras nothing?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Pistol, I would be quiet.	999
	999
PISTOL	Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf: what! we have seen	999
	the seven stars.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	For God's sake, thrust him down stairs: I cannot	999
	endure such a fustian rascal.	999
	999
PISTOL	Thrust him down stairs! know we not Galloway nags?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat	999
	shilling: nay, an a' do nothing but speak nothing,	999
	a' shall be nothing here.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Come, get you down stairs.	999
	999
PISTOL	What! shall we have incision? shall we imbrue?	999
	999
	[Snatching up his sword]	999
	999
	Then death rock me asleep, abridge my doleful days!	999
	Why, then, let grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds	999
	Untwine the Sisters Three! Come, Atropos, I say!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Here's goodly stuff toward!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Give me my rapier, boy.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee, do not draw.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Get you down stairs.	999
	999
	[Drawing, and driving PISTOL out]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Here's a goodly tumult! I'll forswear keeping	999
	house, afore I'll be in these tirrits and frights.	999
	So; murder, I warrant now. Alas, alas! put up	999
	your naked weapons, put up your naked weapons.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PISTOL and BARDOLPH]	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	I pray thee, Jack, be quiet; the rascal's gone.	999
	Ah, you whoreson little valiant villain, you!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	He you not hurt i' the groin? methought a' made a	999
	shrewd thrust at your belly.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BARDOLPH]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Have you turned him out o' doors?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Yea, sir. The rascal's drunk: you have hurt him,	999
	sir, i' the shoulder.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	A rascal! to brave me!	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Ah, you sweet little rogue, you! alas, poor ape,	999
	how thou sweatest! come, let me wipe thy face;	999
	come on, you whoreson chops: ah, rogue! i'faith, I	999
	love thee: thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy,	999
	worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better than	999
	the Nine Worthies: ah, villain!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	A rascally slave! I will toss the rogue in a blanket.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Do, an thou darest for thy heart: an thou dost,	999
	I'll canvass thee between a pair of sheets.	999
	999
	[Enter Music]	999
	999
Page	The music is come, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Let them play. Play, sirs. Sit on my knee, Doll.	999
	A rascal bragging slave! the rogue fled from me	999
	like quicksilver.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	I' faith, and thou followedst him like a church.	999
	Thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig,	999
	when wilt thou leave fighting o' days and foining	999
	o' nights, and begin to patch up thine old body for heaven?	999
	999
	[Enter, behind, PRINCE HENRY and POINS, disguised]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Peace, good Doll! do not speak like a death's-head;	999
	do not bid me remember mine end.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Sirrah, what humour's the prince of?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	A good shallow young fellow: a' would have made a	999
	good pantler, a' would ha' chipp'd bread well.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	They say Poins has a good wit.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	He a good wit? hang him, baboon! his wit's as thick	999
	as Tewksbury mustard; there's no more conceit in him	999
	than is in a mallet.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Why does the prince love him so, then?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Because their legs are both of a bigness, and a'	999
	plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel,	999
	and drinks off candles' ends for flap-dragons, and	999
	rides the wild-mare with the boys, and jumps upon	999
	joined-stools, and swears with a good grace, and	999
	wears his boots very smooth, like unto the sign of	999
	the leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreet	999
	stories; and such other gambol faculties a' has,	999
	that show a weak mind and an able body, for the	999
	which the prince admits him: for the prince himself	999
	is such another; the weight of a hair will turn the	999
	scales between their avoirdupois.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off?	999
	999
POINS	Let's beat him before his whore.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Look, whether the withered elder hath not his poll	999
	clawed like a parrot.	999
	999
POINS	Is it not strange that desire should so many years	999
	outlive performance?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Kiss me, Doll.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction! what	999
	says the almanac to that?	999
	999
POINS	And look, whether the fiery Trigon, his man, be not	999
	lisping to his master's old tables, his note-book,	999
	his counsel-keeper.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Thou dost give me flattering busses.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	By my troth, I kiss thee with a most constant heart.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I am old, I am old.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	I love thee better than I love e'er a scurvy young	999
	boy of them all.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What stuff wilt have a kirtle of? I shall receive	999
	money o' Thursday: shalt have a cap to-morrow. A	999
	merry song, come: it grows late; we'll to bed.	999
	Thou'lt forget me when I am gone.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	By my troth, thou'lt set me a-weeping, an thou	999
	sayest so: prove that ever I dress myself handsome	999
	till thy return: well, harken at the end.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Some sack, Francis.	999
	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	|	999
	|  Anon, anon, sir.	999
POINS	|	999
	999
	999
	[Coming forward]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Ha! a bastard son of the king's? And art not thou	999
	Poins his brother?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Why, thou globe of sinful continents! what a life	999
	dost thou lead!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	A better than thou: I am a gentleman; thou art a drawer.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Very true, sir; and I come to draw you out by the ears.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	O, the Lord preserve thy good grace! by my troth,	999
	welcome to London. Now, the Lord bless that sweet	999
	face of thine! O, Jesu, are you come from Wales?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty, by this light	999
	flesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	How, you fat fool! I scorn you.	999
	999
POINS	My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge and	999
	turn all to a merriment, if you take not the heat.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	You whoreson candle-mine, you, how vilely did you	999
	speak of me even now before this honest, virtuous,	999
	civil gentlewoman!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	God's blessing of your good heart! and so she is,	999
	by my troth.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Didst thou hear me?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Yea, and you knew me, as you did when you ran away	999
	by Gad's-hill: you knew I was at your back, and	999
	spoke it on purpose to try my patience.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No, no, no; not so; I did not think thou wast within hearing.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse;	999
	and then I know how to handle you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No abuse, Hal, o' mine honour, no abuse.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Not to dispraise me, and call me pantier and	999
	bread-chipper and I know not what?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No abuse, Hal.	999
	999
POINS	No abuse?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No abuse, Ned, i' the world; honest Ned, none. I	999
	dispraised him before the wicked, that the wicked	999
	might not fall in love with him; in which doing, I	999
	have done the part of a careful friend and a true	999
	subject, and thy father is to give me thanks for it.	999
	No abuse, Hal: none, Ned, none: no, faith, boys, none.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	See now, whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth	999
	not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to	999
	close with us? is she of the wicked? is thine	999
	hostess here of the wicked? or is thy boy of the	999
	wicked? or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in his	999
	nose, of the wicked?	999
	999
POINS	Answer, thou dead elm, answer.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable;	999
	and his face is Lucifer's privy-kitchen, where he	999
	doth nothing but roast malt-worms. For the boy,	999
	there is a good angel about him; but the devil	999
	outbids him too.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	For the women?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	For one of them, she is in hell already, and burns	999
	poor souls. For the other, I owe her money, and	999
	whether she be damned for that, I know not.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	No, I warrant you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No, I think thou art not; I think thou art quit for	999
	that. Marry, there is another indictment upon thee,	999
	for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house,	999
	contrary to the law; for the which I think thou wilt howl.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	All victuallers do so; what's a joint of mutton or	999
	two in a whole Lent?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	You, gentlewoman,-	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	What says your grace?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	His grace says that which his flesh rebels against.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Who knocks so loud at door? Look to the door there, Francis.	999
	999
	[Enter PETO]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Peto, how now! what news?	999
	999
PETO	The king your father is at Westminster:	999
	And there are twenty weak and wearied posts	999
	Come from the north: and, as I came along,	999
	I met and overtook a dozen captains,	999
	Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the taverns,	999
	And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame,	999
	So idly to profane the precious time,	999
	When tempest of commotion, like the south	999
	Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt	999
	And drop upon our bare unarmed heads.	999
	Give me my sword and cloak. Falstaff, good night.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PRINCE HENRY, POINS, PETO and BARDOLPH]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night, and	999
	we must hence and leave it unpicked.	999
	999
	[Knocking within]	999
	999
	More knocking at the door!	999
	999
	[Re-enter BARDOLPH]	999
	999
	How now! what's the matter?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	You must away to court, sir, presently;	999
	A dozen captains stay at door for you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	[To the Page]  Pay the musicians, sirrah. Farewell,	999
	hostess; farewell, Doll. You see, my good wenches,	999
	how men of merit are sought after: the undeserver	999
	may sleep, when the man of action is called on.	999
	Farewell good wenches: if I be not sent away post,	999
	I will see you again ere I go.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	I cannot speak; if my heart be not read to burst,--	999
	well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Farewell, farewell.	999
	999
	[Exeunt FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Well, fare thee well: I have known thee these	999
	twenty-nine years, come peascod-time; but an	999
	honester and truer-hearted man,--well, fare thee well.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	[Within]  Mistress Tearsheet!	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	What's the matter?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	[Within]  Good Mistress Tearsheet, come to my master.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	O, run, Doll, run; run, good Doll: come.	999
	999
	[She comes blubbered]	999
	999
	Yea, will you come, Doll?	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Westminster. The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING HENRY IV in his nightgown, with a Page]	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;	999
	But, ere they come, bid them o'er-read these letters,	999
	And well consider of them; make good speed.	999
	999
	[Exit Page]	999
	999
	How many thousand of my poorest subjects	999
	Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,	999
	Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,	999
	That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down	999
	And steep my senses in forgetfulness?	999
	Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,	999
	Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee	999
	And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,	999
	Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,	999
	Under the canopies of costly state,	999
	And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?	999
	O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile	999
	In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch	999
	A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?	999
	Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast	999
	Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains	999
	In cradle of the rude imperious surge	999
	And in the visitation of the winds,	999
	Who take the ruffian billows by the top,	999
	Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them	999
	With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,	999
	That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?	999
	Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose	999
	To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,	999
	And in the calmest and most stillest night,	999
	With all appliances and means to boot,	999
	Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down!	999
	Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.	999
	999
	[Enter WARWICK and SURREY]	999
	999
WARWICK	Many good morrows to your majesty!	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Is it good morrow, lords?	999
	999
WARWICK	'Tis one o'clock, and past.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Why, then, good morrow to you all, my lords.	999
	Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?	999
	999
WARWICK	We have, my liege.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Then you perceive the body of our kingdom	999
	How foul it is; what rank diseases grow	999
	And with what danger, near the heart of it.	999
	999
WARWICK	It is but as a body yet distemper'd;	999
	Which to his former strength may be restored	999
	With good advice and little medicine:	999
	My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	O God! that one might read the book of fate,	999
	And see the revolution of the times	999
	Make mountains level, and the continent,	999
	Weary of solid firmness, melt itself	999
	Into the sea! and, other times, to see	999
	The beachy girdle of the ocean	999
	Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,	999
	And changes fill the cup of alteration	999
	With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,	999
	The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,	999
	What perils past, what crosses to ensue,	999
	Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.	999
	'Tis not 'ten years gone	999
	Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,	999
	Did feast together, and in two years after	999
	Were they at wars: it is but eight years since	999
	This Percy was the man nearest my soul,	999
	Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs	999
	And laid his love and life under my foot,	999
	Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard	999
	Gave him defiance. But which of you was by--	999
	You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember--	999
	999
	[To WARWICK]	999
	999
	When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,	999
	Then cheque'd and rated by Northumberland,	999
	Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?	999
	'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which	999
	My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;'	999
	Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,	999
	But that necessity so bow'd the state	999
	That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss:	999
	'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,	999
	'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,	999
	Shall break into corruption:' so went on,	999
	Foretelling this same time's condition	999
	And the division of our amity.	999
	999
WARWICK	There is a history in all men's lives,	999
	Figuring the nature of the times deceased;	999
	The which observed, a man may prophesy,	999
	With a near aim, of the main chance of things	999
	As yet not come to life, which in their seeds	999
	And weak beginnings lie intreasured.	999
	Such things become the hatch and brood of time;	999
	And by the necessary form of this	999
	King Richard might create a perfect guess	999
	That great Northumberland, then false to him,	999
	Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness;	999
	Which should not find a ground to root upon,	999
	Unless on you.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	                  Are these things then necessities?	999
	Then let us meet them like necessities:	999
	And that same word even now cries out on us:	999
	They say the bishop and Northumberland	999
	Are fifty thousand strong.	999
	999
WARWICK	It cannot be, my lord;	999
	Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,	999
	The numbers of the fear'd. Please it your grace	999
	To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,	999
	The powers that you already have sent forth	999
	Shall bring this prize in very easily.	999
	To comfort you the more, I have received	999
	A certain instance that Glendower is dead.	999
	Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill,	999
	And these unseason'd hours perforce must add	999
	Unto your sickness.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	I will take your counsel:	999
	And were these inward wars once out of hand,	999
	We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.	999

SCENE II	Gloucestershire. Before SHALLOW'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SHALLOW and SILENCE, meeting; MOULDY,	999
	SHADOW, WART, FEEBLE, BULLCALF, a Servant or two	999
	with them]	999
	999
SHALLOW	Come on, come on, come on, sir; give me your hand,	999
	sir, give me your hand, sir: an early stirrer, by	999
	the rood! And how doth my good cousin Silence?	999
	999
SILENCE	Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.	999
	999
SHALLOW	And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow? and your	999
	fairest daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?	999
	999
SILENCE	Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow!	999
	999
SHALLOW	By yea and nay, sir, I dare say my cousin William is	999
	become a good scholar: he is at Oxford still, is he not?	999
	999
SILENCE	Indeed, sir, to my cost.	999
	999
SHALLOW	A' must, then, to the inns o' court shortly. I was	999
	once of Clement's Inn, where I think they will	999
	talk of mad Shallow yet.	999
	999
SILENCE	You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.	999
	999
SHALLOW	By the mass, I was called any thing; and I would	999
	have done any thing indeed too, and roundly too.	999
	There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,	999
	and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and	999
	Will Squele, a Cotswold man; you had not four such	999
	swinge-bucklers in all the inns o' court again: and	999
	I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were	999
	and had the best of them all at commandment. Then	999
	was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to	999
	Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.	999
	999
SILENCE	This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?	999
	999
SHALLOW	The same Sir John, the very same. I  see him break	999
	Skogan's head at the court-gate, when a' was a	999
	crack not thus high: and the very same day did I	999
	fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,	999
	behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I	999
	have spent! and to see how many of my old	999
	acquaintance are dead!	999
	999
SILENCE	We shall all follow, cousin.	999
	999
SHADOW	Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure: death,	999
	as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shall	999
	die. How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair?	999
	999
SILENCE	By my troth, I was not there.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living	999
	yet?	999
	999
SILENCE	Dead, sir.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Jesu, Jesu, dead! a' drew a good bow; and dead! a'	999
	shot a fine shoot: John a Gaunt loved him well, and	999
	betted much money on his head. Dead! a' would have	999
	clapped i' the clout at twelve score; and carried	999
	you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a	999
	half, that it would have done a man's heart good to	999
	see. How a score of ewes now?	999
	999
SILENCE	Thereafter as they be: a score of good ewes may be	999
	worth ten pounds.	999
	999
SHALLOW	And is old Double dead?	999
	999
SILENCE	Here come two of Sir John Falstaff's men, as I think.	999
	999
	[Enter BARDOLPH and one with him]	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Good morrow, honest gentlemen: I beseech you, which	999
	is Justice Shallow?	999
	999
SHALLOW	I am Robert Shallow, sir; a poor esquire of this	999
	county, and one of the king's justices of the peace:	999
	What is your good pleasure with me?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	My captain, sir, commends him to you; my captain,	999
	Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, and	999
	a most gallant leader.	999
	999
SHALLOW	He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword	999
	man. How doth the good knight? may I ask how my	999
	lady his wife doth?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than	999
	with a wife.	999
	999
SHALLOW	It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said	999
	indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,	999
	indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever	999
	were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of	999
	'accommodo' very good; a good phrase.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase call	999
	you it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;	999
	but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a	999
	soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good	999
	command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a	999
	man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,	999
	being, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated;	999
	which is an excellent thing.	999
	999
SHALLOW	It is very just.	999
	999
	[Enter FALSTAFF]	999
	999
	Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me your good	999
	hand, give me your worship's good hand: by my	999
	troth, you like well and bear your years very well:	999
	welcome, good Sir John.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert	999
	Shallow: Master Surecard, as I think?	999
	999
SHALLOW	No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of	999
	the peace.	999
	999
SILENCE	Your good-worship is welcome.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Fie! this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have you	999
	provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?	999
	999
SHALLOW	Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Let me see them, I beseech you.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Where's the roll? where's the roll? where's the	999
	roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so:	999
	yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear as	999
	I call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me	999
	see; where is Mouldy?	999
	999
MOULDY	Here, an't please you.	999
	999
SHALLOW	What think you, Sir John? a good-limbed fellow;	999
	young, strong, and of good friends.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Is thy name Mouldy?	999
	999
MOULDY	Yea, an't please you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Tis the more time thou wert used.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things that	999
	are mouldy lack use: very singular good! in faith,	999
	well said, Sir John, very well said.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Prick him.	999
	999
MOULDY	I was pricked well enough before, an you could have	999
	let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for	999
	one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need	999
	not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter	999
	to go out than I.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is	999
	time you were spent.	999
	999
MOULDY	Spent!	999
	999
SHALLOW	Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: know you where	999
	you are? For the other, Sir John: let me see:	999
	Simon Shadow!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under: he's like	999
	to be a cold soldier.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Where's Shadow?	999
	999
SHADOW	Here, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Shadow, whose son art thou?	999
	999
SHADOW	My mother's son, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Thy mother's son! like enough, and thy father's	999
	shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of	999
	the male: it is often so, indeed; but much of the	999
	father's substance!	999
	999
SHALLOW	Do you like him, Sir John?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we have	999
	a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Thomas Wart!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Where's he?	999
	999
WART	Here, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Is thy name Wart?	999
	999
WART	Yea, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Thou art a very ragged wart.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Shall I prick him down, Sir John?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon	999
	his back and the whole frame stands upon pins:	999
	prick him no more.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: I	999
	commend you well. Francis Feeble!	999
	999
FEEBLE	Here, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What trade art thou, Feeble?	999
	999
FEEBLE	A woman's tailor, sir.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Shall I prick him, sir?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	You may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ld	999
	ha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in	999
	an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?	999
	999
FEEBLE	I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well said, good woman's tailor! well said,	999
	courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as the	999
	wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the	999
	woman's tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.	999
	999
FEEBLE	I would Wart might have gone, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst	999
	mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him	999
	to a private soldier that is the leader of so many	999
	thousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.	999
	999
FEEBLE	It shall suffice, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?	999
	999
SHALLOW	Peter Bullcalf o' the green!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.	999
	999
BULLCALF	Here, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf	999
	till he roar again.	999
	999
BULLCALF	O Lord! good my lord captain,--	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?	999
	999
BULLCALF	O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What disease hast thou?	999
	999
BULLCALF	A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught	999
	with ringing in the king's affairs upon his	999
	coronation-day, sir.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we wilt	999
	have away thy cold; and I will take such order that	999
	my friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?	999
	999
SHALLOW	Here is two more called than your number, you must	999
	have but four here, sir: and so, I pray you, go in	999
	with me to dinner.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry	999
	dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.	999
	999
SHALLOW	O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night	999
	in the windmill in Saint George's field?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Ha! 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	She lives, Master Shallow.	999
	999
SHALLOW	She never could away with me.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Never, never; she would always say she could not	999
	abide Master Shallow.	999
	999
SHALLOW	By the mass, I could anger her to the heart. She	999
	was then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Old, old, Master Shallow.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;	999
	certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork by old	999
	Nightwork before I came to Clement's Inn.	999
	999
SILENCE	That's fifty-five year ago.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that	999
	this knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.	999
	999
SHALLOW	That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith,	999
	Sir John, we have: our watch-word was 'Hem boys!'	999
	Come, let's to dinner; come, let's to dinner:	999
	Jesus, the days that we have seen! Come, come.	999
	999
	[Exeunt FALSTAFF and Justices]	999
	999
BULLCALF	Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend;	999
	and here's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns	999
	for you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief be	999
	hanged, sir, as go: and yet, for mine own part, sir,	999
	I do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling,	999
	and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with	999
	my friends; else, sir, I did not care, for mine own	999
	part, so much.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Go to; stand aside.	999
	999
MOULDY	And, good master corporal captain, for my old	999
	dame's sake, stand my friend: she has nobody to do	999
	any thing about her when I am gone; and she is old,	999
	and cannot help herself: You shall have forty, sir.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Go to; stand aside.	999
	999
FEEBLE	By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once: we	999
	owe God a death: I'll ne'er bear a base mind:	999
	an't be my destiny, so; an't be not, so: no man is	999
	too good to serve's prince; and let it go which way	999
	it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Well said; thou'rt a good fellow.	999
	999
FEEBLE	Faith, I'll bear no base mind.	999
	999
	[Re-enter FALSTAFF and the Justices]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Come, sir, which men shall I have?	999
	999
SHALLOW	Four of which you please.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Sir, a word with you: I have three pound to free	999
	Mouldy and Bullcalf.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Go to; well.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Come, Sir John, which four will you have?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Do you choose for me.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble and Shadow.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home	999
	till you are past service: and for your part,	999
	Bullcalf, grow till you come unto it: I will none of you.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they are	999
	your likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a	999
	man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,	999
	bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the	999
	spirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what a	999
	ragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you and	999
	discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's	999
	hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets	999
	on the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced	999
	fellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no	999
	mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim	999
	level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;	999
	how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run	999
	off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the	999
	great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well: go	999
	to: very good, exceeding good. O, give me always a	999
	little, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i'	999
	faith, Wart; thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's a	999
	tester for thee.	999
	999
SHALLOW	He is not his craft's master; he doth not do it	999
	right. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at	999
	Clement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's	999
	show,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a'	999
	would manage you his piece thus; and a' would about	999
	and about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah,	999
	tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; and	999
	away again would a' go, and again would a' come: I	999
	shall ne'er see such a fellow.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God	999
	keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words	999
	with you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thank	999
	you: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, give	999
	the soldiers coats.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Sir John, the Lord bless you! God prosper your	999
	affairs! God send us peace! At your return visit	999
	our house; let our old acquaintance be renewed;	999
	peradventure I will with ye to the court.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Fore God, I would you would, Master Shallow.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Fare you well, gentle gentlemen.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Justices]	999
	999
	On, Bardolph; lead the men away.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BARDOLPH, Recruits, &c]	999
	999
	As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do	999
	see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how	999
	subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This	999
	same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to	999
	me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he	999
	hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third	999
	word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's	999
	tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a	999
	man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'	999
	was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked	999
	radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it	999
	with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his	999
	dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'	999
	was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a	999
	monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came	999
	ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those	999
	tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the	999
	carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or	999
	his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger	999
	become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a	999
	Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and	999
	I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the	999
	Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding	999
	among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a	999
	Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have	999
	thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the	999
	case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a	999
	court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll	999
	be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall	999
	go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two	999
	stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the	999
	old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I	999
	may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Yorkshire. Gaultree Forest.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, MOWBRAY, LORD	999
	HASTINGS, and others]	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	What is this forest call'd?	999
	999
HASTINGS	'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your grace.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Here stand, my lords; and send discoverers forth	999
	To know the numbers of our enemies.	999
	999
HASTINGS	We have sent forth already.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	'Tis well done.	999
	My friends and brethren in these great affairs,	999
	I must acquaint you that I have received	999
	New-dated letters from Northumberland;	999
	Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:	999
	Here doth he wish his person, with such powers	999
	As might hold sortance with his quality,	999
	The which he could not levy; whereupon	999
	He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,	999
	To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers	999
	That your attempts may overlive the hazard	999
	And fearful melting of their opposite.	999
	999
MOWBRAY	Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground	999
	And dash themselves to pieces.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
HASTINGS	Now, what news?	999
	999
Messenger	West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,	999
	In goodly form comes on the enemy;	999
	And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number	999
	Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.	999
	999
MOWBRAY	The just proportion that we gave them out	999
	Let us sway on and face them in the field.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	What well-appointed leader fronts us here?	999
	999
	[Enter WESTMORELAND]	999
	999
MOWBRAY	I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Health and fair greeting from our general,	999
	The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:	999
	What doth concern your coming?	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Then, my lord,	999
	Unto your grace do I in chief address	999
	The substance of my speech. If that rebellion	999
	Came like itself, in base and abject routs,	999
	Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,	999
	And countenanced by boys and beggary,	999
	I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,	999
	In his true, native and most proper shape,	999
	You, reverend father, and these noble lords	999
	Had not been here, to dress the ugly form	999
	Of base and bloody insurrection	999
	With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,	999
	Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,	999
	Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,	999
	Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,	999
	Whose white investments figure innocence,	999
	The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,	999
	Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself	999
	Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,	999
	Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;	999
	Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,	999
	Your pens to lances and your tongue divine	999
	To a trumpet and a point of war?	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.	999
	Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,	999
	And with our surfeiting and wanton hours	999
	Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,	999
	And we must bleed for it; of which disease	999
	Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.	999
	But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,	999
	I take not on me here as a physician,	999
	Nor do I as an enemy to peace	999
	Troop in the throngs of military men;	999
	But rather show awhile like fearful war,	999
	To diet rank minds sick of happiness	999
	And purge the obstructions which begin to stop	999
	Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.	999
	I have in equal balance justly weigh'd	999
	What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,	999
	And find our griefs heavier than our offences.	999
	We see which way the stream of time doth run,	999
	And are enforced from our most quiet there	999
	By the rough torrent of occasion;	999
	And have the summary of all our griefs,	999
	When time shall serve, to show in articles;	999
	Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,	999
	And might by no suit gain our audience:	999
	When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,	999
	We are denied access unto his person	999
	Even by those men that most have done us wrong.	999
	The dangers of the days but newly gone,	999
	Whose memory is written on the earth	999
	With yet appearing blood, and the examples	999
	Of every minute's instance, present now,	999
	Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,	999
	Not to break peace or any branch of it,	999
	But to establish here a peace indeed,	999
	Concurring both in name and quality.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	When ever yet was your appeal denied?	999
	Wherein have you been galled by the king?	999
	What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,	999
	That you should seal this lawless bloody book	999
	Of forged rebellion with a seal divine	999
	And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	My brother general, the commonwealth,	999
	To brother born an household cruelty,	999
	I make my quarrel in particular.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	There is no need of any such redress;	999
	Or if there were, it not belongs to you.	999
	999
MOWBRAY	Why not to him in part, and to us all	999
	That feel the bruises of the days before,	999
	And suffer the condition of these times	999
	To lay a heavy and unequal hand	999
	Upon our honours?	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	                  O, my good Lord Mowbray,	999
	Construe the times to their necessities,	999
	And you shall say indeed, it is the time,	999
	And not the king, that doth you injuries.	999
	Yet for your part, it not appears to me	999
	Either from the king or in the present time	999
	That you should have an inch of any ground	999
	To build a grief on: were you not restored	999
	To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,	999
	Your noble and right well remember'd father's?	999
	999
MOWBRAY	What thing, in honour, had my father lost,	999
	That need to be revived and breathed in me?	999
	The king that loved him, as the state stood then,	999
	Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:	999
	And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,	999
	Being mounted and both roused in their seats,	999
	Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,	999
	Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,	999
	Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel	999
	And the loud trumpet blowing them together,	999
	Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd	999
	My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,	999
	O when the king did throw his warder down,	999
	His own life hung upon the staff he threw;	999
	Then threw he down himself and all their lives	999
	That by indictment and by dint of sword	999
	Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.	999
	The Earl of Hereford was reputed then	999
	In England the most valiant gentlemen:	999
	Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?	999
	But if your father had been victor there,	999
	He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:	999
	For all the country in a general voice	999
	Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love	999
	Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on	999
	And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.	999
	But this is mere digression from my purpose.	999
	Here come I from our princely general	999
	To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace	999
	That he will give you audience; and wherein	999
	It shall appear that your demands are just,	999
	You shall enjoy them, every thing set off	999
	That might so much as think you enemies.	999
	999
MOWBRAY	But he hath forced us to compel this offer;	999
	And it proceeds from policy, not love.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Mowbray, you overween to take it so;	999
	This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:	999
	For, lo! within a ken our army lies,	999
	Upon mine honour, all too confident	999
	To give admittance to a thought of fear.	999
	Our battle is more full of names than yours,	999
	Our men more perfect in the use of arms,	999
	Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;	999
	Then reason will our heart should be as good	999
	Say you not then our offer is compell'd.	999
	999
MOWBRAY	Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	That argues but the shame of your offence:	999
	A rotten case abides no handling.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Hath the Prince John a full commission,	999
	In very ample virtue of his father,	999
	To hear and absolutely to determine	999
	Of what conditions we shall stand upon?	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	That is intended in the general's name:	999
	I muse you make so slight a question.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,	999
	For this contains our general grievances:	999
	Each several article herein redress'd,	999
	All members of our cause, both here and hence,	999
	That are insinew'd to this action,	999
	Acquitted by a true substantial form	999
	And present execution of our wills	999
	To us and to our purposes confined,	999
	We come within our awful banks again	999
	And knit our powers to the arm of peace.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	This will I show the general. Please you, lords,	999
	In sight of both our battles we may meet;	999
	And either end in peace, which God so frame!	999
	Or to the place of difference call the swords	999
	Which must decide it.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	My lord, we will do so.	999
	999
	[Exit WESTMORELAND]	999
	999
MOWBRAY	There is a thing within my bosom tells me	999
	That no conditions of our peace can stand.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Fear you not that: if we can make our peace	999
	Upon such large terms and so absolute	999
	As our conditions shall consist upon,	999
	Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.	999
	999
MOWBRAY	Yea, but our valuation shall be such	999
	That every slight and false-derived cause,	999
	Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason	999
	Shall to the king taste of this action;	999
	That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,	999
	We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind	999
	That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff	999
	And good from bad find no partition.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary	999
	Of dainty and such picking grievances:	999
	For he hath found to end one doubt by death	999
	Revives two greater in the heirs of life,	999
	And therefore will he wipe his tables clean	999
	And keep no tell-tale to his memory	999
	That may repeat and history his loss	999
	To new remembrance; for full well he knows	999
	He cannot so precisely weed this land	999
	As his misdoubts present occasion:	999
	His foes are so enrooted with his friends	999
	That, plucking to unfix an enemy,	999
	He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:	999
	So that this land, like an offensive wife	999
	That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,	999
	As he is striking, holds his infant up	999
	And hangs resolved correction in the arm	999
	That was uprear'd to execution.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods	999
	On late offenders, that he now doth lack	999
	The very instruments of chastisement:	999
	So that his power, like to a fangless lion,	999
	May offer, but not hold.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	'Tis very true:	999
	And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,	999
	If we do now make our atonement well,	999
	Our peace will, like a broken limb united,	999
	Grow stronger for the breaking.	999
	999
MOWBRAY	Be it so.	999
	Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.	999
	999
	[Re-enter WESTMORELAND]	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	The prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordship	999
	To meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.	999
	999
MOWBRAY	Your grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Before, and greet his grace: my lord, we come.	999

SCENE II	Another part of the forest.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter, from one side, MOWBRAY, attended; afterwards	999
	the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, HASTINGS, and others: from	999
	the other side, Prince John of LANCASTER, and	999
	WESTMORELAND; Officers, and others with them]	999
	999
LANCASTER	You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:	999
	Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;	999
	And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.	999
	My Lord of York, it better show'd with you	999
	When that your flock, assembled by the bell,	999
	Encircled you to hear with reverence	999
	Your exposition on the holy text	999
	Than now to see you here an iron man,	999
	Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,	999
	Turning the word to sword and life to death.	999
	That man that sits within a monarch's heart,	999
	And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,	999
	Would he abuse the countenance of the king,	999
	Alack, what mischiefs might he set abrooch	999
	In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,	999
	It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken	999
	How deep you were within the books of God?	999
	To us the speaker in his parliament;	999
	To us the imagined voice of God himself;	999
	The very opener and intelligencer	999
	Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven	999
	And our dull workings. O, who shall believe	999
	But you misuse the reverence of your place,	999
	Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,	999
	As a false favourite doth his prince's name,	999
	In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,	999
	Under the counterfeited zeal of God,	999
	The subjects of his substitute, my father,	999
	And both against the peace of heaven and him	999
	Have here up-swarm'd them.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Good my Lord of Lancaster,	999
	I am not here against your father's peace;	999
	But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,	999
	The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,	999
	Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,	999
	To hold our safety up. I sent your grace	999
	The parcels and particulars of our grief,	999
	The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,	999
	Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;	999
	Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep	999
	With grant of our most just and right desires,	999
	And true obedience, of this madness cured,	999
	Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.	999
	999
MOWBRAY	If not, we ready are to try our fortunes	999
	To the last man.	999
	999
HASTINGS	                  And though we here fall down,	999
	We have supplies to second our attempt:	999
	If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;	999
	And so success of mischief shall be born	999
	And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up	999
	Whiles England shall have generation.	999
	999
LANCASTER	You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,	999
	To sound the bottom of the after-times.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly	999
	How far forth you do like their articles.	999
	999
LANCASTER	I like them all, and do allow them well,	999
	And swear here, by the honour of my blood,	999
	My father's purposes have been mistook,	999
	And some about him have too lavishly	999
	Wrested his meaning and authority.	999
	My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;	999
	Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,	999
	Discharge your powers unto their several counties,	999
	As we will ours: and here between the armies	999
	Let's drink together friendly and embrace,	999
	That all their eyes may bear those tokens home	999
	Of our restored love and amity.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	I take your princely word for these redresses.	999
	999
LANCASTER	I give it you, and will maintain my word:	999
	And thereupon I drink unto your grace.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Go, captain, and deliver to the army	999
	This news of peace: let them have pay, and part:	999
	I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.	999
	999
	[Exit Officer]	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	I pledge your grace; and, if you knew what pains	999
	I have bestow'd to breed this present peace,	999
	You would drink freely: but my love to ye	999
	Shall show itself more openly hereafter.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	I do not doubt you.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	I am glad of it.	999
	Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.	999
	999
MOWBRAY	You wish me health in very happy season;	999
	For I am, on the sudden, something ill.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Against ill chances men are ever merry;	999
	But heaviness foreruns the good event.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow	999
	Serves to say thus, 'some good thing comes	999
	to-morrow.'	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.	999
	999
MOWBRAY	So much the worse, if your own rule be true.	999
	999
	[Shouts within]	999
	999
LANCASTER	The word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout!	999
	999
MOWBRAY	This had been cheerful after victory.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	A peace is of the nature of a conquest;	999
	For then both parties nobly are subdued,	999
	And neither party loser.	999
	999
LANCASTER	Go, my lord,	999
	And let our army be discharged too.	999
	999
	[Exit WESTMORELAND]	999
	999
	And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains	999
	March, by us, that we may peruse the men	999
	We should have coped withal.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Go, good Lord Hastings,	999
	And, ere they be dismissed, let them march by.	999
	999
	[Exit HASTINGS]	999
	999
LANCASTER	I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.	999
	999
	[Re-enter WESTMORELAND]	999
	999
	Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	The leaders, having charge from you to stand,	999
	Will not go off until they hear you speak.	999
	999
LANCASTER	They know their duties.	999
	999
	[Re-enter HASTINGS]	999
	999
HASTINGS	My lord, our army is dispersed already;	999
	Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses	999
	East, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,	999
	Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which	999
	I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:	999
	And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,	999
	Of capitol treason I attach you both.	999
	999
MOWBRAY	Is this proceeding just and honourable?	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Is your assembly so?	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Will you thus break your faith?	999
	999
LANCASTER	I pawn'd thee none:	999
	I promised you redress of these same grievances	999
	Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,	999
	I will perform with a most Christian care.	999
	But for you, rebels, look to taste the due	999
	Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.	999
	Most shallowly did you these arms commence,	999
	Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.	999
	Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:	999
	God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.	999
	Some guard these traitors to the block of death,	999
	Treason's true bed and yielder up of breath.	999

SCENE III	Another part of the forest.	999
	999
	999
	[Alarum. Excursions. Enter FALSTAFF and COLEVILE, meeting]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What's your name, sir? of what condition are you,	999
	and of what place, I pray?	999
	999
COLEVILE	I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the dale.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your	999
	degree, and your place the dale: Colevile shall be	999
	still your name, a traitor your degree, and the	999
	dungeon your place, a place deep enough; so shall	999
	you be still Colevile of the dale.	999
	999
COLEVILE	Are not you Sir John Falstaff?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye	999
	yield, sir? or shall I sweat for you? if I do	999
	sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they	999
	weep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear and	999
	trembling, and do observance to my mercy.	999
	999
COLEVILE	I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that	999
	thought yield me.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of	999
	mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other	999
	word but my name. An I had but a belly of any	999
	indifference, I were simply the most active fellow	999
	in Europe: my womb, my womb, my womb, undoes me.	999
	Here comes our general.	999
	999
	[Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND,	999
	BLUNT, and others]	999
	999
LANCASTER	The heat is past; follow no further now:	999
	Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.	999
	999
	[Exit WESTMORELAND]	999
	999
	Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?	999
	When every thing is ended, then you come:	999
	These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,	999
	One time or other break some gallows' back.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I	999
	never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward	999
	of valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a	999
	bullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the	999
	expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with	999
	the very extremest inch of possibility; I have	999
	foundered nine score and odd posts: and here,	999
	travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and	999
	immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the	999
	dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy.	999
	But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I	999
	may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,	999
	'I came, saw, and overcame.'	999
	999
LANCASTER	It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I know not: here he is, and here I yield him: and	999
	I beseech your grace, let it be booked with the	999
	rest of this day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I will	999
	have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own	999
	picture on the top on't, Colevile kissing my foot:	999
	to the which course if I be enforced, if you do not	999
	all show like gilt twopences to me, and I in the	999
	clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full	999
	moon doth the cinders of the element, which show	999
	like pins' heads to her, believe not the word of	999
	the noble: therefore let me have right, and let	999
	desert mount.	999
	999
LANCASTER	Thine's too heavy to mount.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Let it shine, then.	999
	999
LANCASTER	Thine's too thick to shine.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me	999
	good, and call it what you will.	999
	999
LANCASTER	Is thy name Colevile?	999
	999
COLEVILE	It is, my lord.	999
	999
LANCASTER	A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	And a famous true subject took him.	999
	999
COLEVILE	I am, my lord, but as my betters are	999
	That led me hither: had they been ruled by me,	999
	You should have won them dearer than you have.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I know not how they sold themselves: but thou, like	999
	a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I	999
	thank thee for thee.	999
	999
	[Re-enter WESTMORELAND]	999
	999
LANCASTER	Now, have you left pursuit?	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Retreat is made and execution stay'd.	999
	999
LANCASTER	Send Colevile with his confederates	999
	To York, to present execution:	999
	Blunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BLUNT and others with COLEVILE]	999
	999
	And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords:	999
	I hear the king my father is sore sick:	999
	Our news shall go before us to his majesty,	999
	Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,	999
	And we with sober speed will follow you.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My lord, I beseech you, give me leave to go	999
	Through Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,	999
	Stand my good lord, pray, in your good report.	999
	999
LANCASTER	Fare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,	999
	Shall better speak of you than you deserve.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but Falstaff]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than	999
	your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-	999
	blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make	999
	him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.	999
	There's never none of these demure boys come to any	999
	proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,	999
	and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a	999
	kind of male green-sickness; and then when they	999
	marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools	999
	and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for	999
	inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold	999
	operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;	999
	dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy	999
	vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,	999
	quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and	999
	delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the	999
	voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes	999
	excellent wit. The second property of your	999
	excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;	999
	which, before cold and settled, left the liver	999
	white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity	999
	and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes	999
	it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:	999
	it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives	999
	warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,	999
	man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and	999
	inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,	999
	the heart, who, great and puffed up with this	999
	retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour	999
	comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is	999
	nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and	999
	learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till	999
	sack commences it and sets it in act and use.	999
	Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for	999
	the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his	999
	father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,	999
	manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent	999
	endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile	999
	sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If	999
	I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I	999
	would teach them should be, to forswear thin	999
	potations and to addict themselves to sack.	999

	How now Bardolph?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	The army is discharged all and gone.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Let them go. I'll through Gloucestershire; and	999
	there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, esquire:	999
	I have him already tempering between my finger and	999
	my thumb, and shortly will I seal with him. Come away.	999

	999
SCENE IV	Westminster. The Jerusalem Chamber.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING HENRY IV, the Princes Thomas of CLARENCE	999
	and Humphrey of GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others]	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Now, lords, if God doth give successful end	999
	To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,	999
	We will our youth lead on to higher fields	999
	And draw no swords but what are sanctified.	999
	Our navy is address'd, our power collected,	999
	Our substitutes in absence well invested,	999
	And every thing lies level to our wish:	999
	Only, we want a little personal strength;	999
	And pause us, till these rebels, now afoot,	999
	Come underneath the yoke of government.	999
	999
WARWICK	Both which we doubt not but your majesty	999
	Shall soon enjoy.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	                  Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,	999
	Where is the prince your brother?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	And how accompanied?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I do not know, my lord.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	No, my good lord; he is in presence here.	999
	999
CLARENCE	What would my lord and father?	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.	999
	How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?	999
	He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;	999
	Thou hast a better place in his affection	999
	Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,	999
	And noble offices thou mayst effect	999
	Of mediation, after I am dead,	999
	Between his greatness and thy other brethren:	999
	Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,	999
	Nor lose the good advantage of his grace	999
	By seeming cold or careless of his will;	999
	For he is gracious, if he be observed:	999
	He hath a tear for pity and a hand	999
	Open as day for melting charity:	999
	Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,	999
	As humorous as winter and as sudden	999
	As flaws congealed in the spring of day.	999
	His temper, therefore, must be well observed:	999
	Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,	999
	When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;	999
	But, being moody, give him line and scope,	999
	Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,	999
	Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,	999
	And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,	999
	A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,	999
	That the united vessel of their blood,	999
	Mingled with venom of suggestion--	999
	As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--	999
	Shall never leak, though it do work as strong	999
	As aconitum or rash gunpowder.	999
	999
CLARENCE	I shall observe him with all care and love.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?	999
	999
CLARENCE	He is not there to-day; he dines in London.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?	999
	999
CLARENCE	With Poins, and other his continual followers.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;	999
	And he, the noble image of my youth,	999
	Is overspread with them: therefore my grief	999
	Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:	999
	The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape	999
	In forms imaginary the unguided days	999
	And rotten times that you shall look upon	999
	When I am sleeping with my ancestors.	999
	For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,	999
	When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,	999
	When means and lavish manners meet together,	999
	O, with what wings shall his affections fly	999
	Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!	999
	999
WARWICK	My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:	999
	The prince but studies his companions	999
	Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,	999
	'Tis needful that the most immodest word	999
	Be look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,	999
	Your highness knows, comes to no further use	999
	But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,	999
	The prince will in the perfectness of time	999
	Cast off his followers; and their memory	999
	Shall as a pattern or a measure live,	999
	By which his grace must mete the lives of others,	999
	Turning past evils to advantages.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb	999
	In the dead carrion.	999
	999
	[Enter WESTMORELAND]	999
	999
		Who's here? Westmoreland?	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Health to my sovereign, and new happiness	999
	Added to that that I am to deliver!	999
	Prince John your son doth kiss your grace's hand:	999
	Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings and all	999
	Are brought to the correction of your law;	999
	There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd	999
	But peace puts forth her olive every where.	999
	The manner how this action hath been borne	999
	Here at more leisure may your highness read,	999
	With every course in his particular.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,	999
	Which ever in the haunch of winter sings	999
	The lifting up of day.	999
	999
	[Enter HARCOURT]	999
	999
		 Look, here's more news.	999
	999
HARCOURT	From enemies heaven keep your majesty;	999
	And, when they stand against you, may they fall	999
	As those that I am come to tell you of!	999
	The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,	999
	With a great power of English and of Scots	999
	Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown:	999
	The manner and true order of the fight	999
	This packet, please it you, contains at large.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	And wherefore should these good news make me sick?	999
	Will fortune never come with both hands full,	999
	But write her fair words still in foulest letters?	999
	She either gives a stomach and no food;	999
	Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast	999
	And takes away the stomach; such are the rich,	999
	That have abundance and enjoy it not.	999
	I should rejoice now at this happy news;	999
	And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:	999
	O me! come near me; now I am much ill.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Comfort, your majesty!	999
	999
CLARENCE	O my royal father!	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.	999
	999
WARWICK	Be patient, princes; you do know, these fits	999
	Are with his highness very ordinary.	999
	Stand from him. Give him air; he'll straight be well.	999
	999
CLARENCE	No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:	999
	The incessant care and labour of his mind	999
	Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in	999
	So thin that life looks through and will break out.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	The people fear me; for they do observe	999
	Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:	999
	The seasons change their manners, as the year	999
	Had found some months asleep and leap'd them over.	999
	999
CLARENCE	The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;	999
	And the old folk, time's doting chronicles,	999
	Say it did so a little time before	999
	That our great-grandsire, Edward, sick'd and died.	999
	999
WARWICK	Speak lower, princes, for the king recovers.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	This apoplexy will certain be his end.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	I pray you, take me up, and bear me hence	999
	Into some other chamber: softly, pray.	999

	[KING HENRY IV lying on a bed: CLARENCE,	999
	GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others in attendance]	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;	999
	Unless some dull and favourable hand	999
	Will whisper music to my weary spirit.	999
	999
WARWICK	Call for the music in the other room.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Set me the crown upon my pillow here.	999
	999
CLARENCE	His eye is hollow, and he changes much.	999
	999
WARWICK	Less noise, less noise!	999
	999
	[Enter PRINCE HENRY]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Who saw the Duke of Clarence?	999
	999
CLARENCE	I am here, brother, full of heaviness.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	How now! rain within doors, and none abroad!	999
	How doth the king?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Exceeding ill.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	                  Heard he the good news yet?	999
	Tell it him.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He alter'd much upon the hearing it.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic.	999
	999
WARWICK	Not so much noise, my lords: sweet prince,	999
	speak low;	999
	The king your father is disposed to sleep.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Let us withdraw into the other room.	999
	999
WARWICK	Will't please your grace to go along with us?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	No; I will sit and watch here by the king.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY]	999
	999
	Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,	999
	Being so troublesome a bedfellow?	999
	O polish'd perturbation! golden care!	999
	That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide	999
	To many a watchful night! sleep with it now!	999
	Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet	999
	As he whose brow with homely biggen bound	999
	Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!	999
	When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit	999
	Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,	999
	That scalds with safety. By his gates of breath	999
	There lies a downy feather which stirs not:	999
	Did he suspire, that light and weightless down	999
	Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!	999
	This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleep	999
	That from this golden rigol hath divorced	999
	So many English kings. Thy due from me	999
	Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,	999
	Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,	999
	Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:	999
	My due from thee is this imperial crown,	999
	Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,	999
	Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,	999
	Which God shall guard: and put the world's whole strength	999
	Into one giant arm, it shall not force	999
	This lineal honour from me: this from thee	999
	Will I to mine leave, as 'tis left to me.	999

CLARENCE	Doth the king call?	999
	999
WARWICK	What would your majesty? How fares your grace?	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?	999
	999
CLARENCE	We left the prince my brother here, my liege,	999
	Who undertook to sit and watch by you.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	The Prince of Wales! Where is he? let me see him:	999
	He is not here.	999
	999
WARWICK	This door is open; he is gone this way.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Where is the crown? who took it from my pillow?	999
	999
WARWICK	When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	The prince hath ta'en it hence: go, seek him out.	999
	Is he so hasty that he doth suppose	999
	My sleep my death?	999
	Find him, my Lord of Warwick; chide him hither.	999
	999
	[Exit WARWICK]	999
	999
	This part of his conjoins with my disease,	999
	And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!	999
	How quickly nature falls into revolt	999
	When gold becomes her object!	999
	For this the foolish over-careful fathers	999
	Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with care,	999
	Their bones with industry;	999
	For this they have engrossed and piled up	999
	The canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold;	999
	For this they have been thoughtful to invest	999
	Their sons with arts and martial exercises:	999
	When, like the bee, culling from every flower	999
	The virtuous sweets,	999
	Our thighs pack'd with wax, our mouths with honey,	999
	We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,	999
	Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste	999
	Yield his engrossments to the ending father.	999
	999
	[Re-enter WARWICK]	999
	999
	Now, where is he that will not stay so long	999
	Till his friend sickness hath determined me?	999
	999
WARWICK	My lord, I found the prince in the next room,	999
	Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,	999
	With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow	999
	That tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,	999
	Would, by beholding him, have wash'd his knife	999
	With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	But wherefore did he take away the crown?	999
	999
	[Re-enter PRINCE HENRY]	999
	999
	Lo, where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.	999
	Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.	999
	999
	[Exeunt WARWICK and the rest]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I never thought to hear you speak again.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:	999
	I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.	999
	Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair	999
	That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours	999
	Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!	999
	Thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee.	999
	Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity	999
	Is held from falling with so weak a wind	999
	That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.	999
	Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours	999
	Were thine without offence; and at my death	999
	Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:	999
	Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,	999
	And thou wilt have me die assured of it.	999
	Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,	999
	Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,	999
	To stab at half an hour of my life.	999
	What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?	999
	Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,	999
	And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear	999
	That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.	999
	Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse	999
	Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:	999
	Only compound me with forgotten dust	999
	Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.	999
	Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;	999
	For now a time is come to mock at form:	999
	Harry the Fifth is crown'd: up, vanity!	999
	Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!	999
	And to the English court assemble now,	999
	From every region, apes of idleness!	999
	Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:	999
	Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,	999
	Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit	999
	The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?	999
	Be happy, he will trouble you no more;	999
	England shall double gild his treble guilt,	999
	England shall give him office, honour, might;	999
	For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks	999
	The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog	999
	Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.	999
	O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!	999
	When that my care could not withhold thy riots,	999
	What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?	999
	O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,	999
	Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,	999
	The moist impediments unto my speech,	999
	I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke	999
	Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard	999
	The course of it so far. There is your crown;	999
	And He that wears the crown immortally	999
	Long guard it yours! If I affect it more	999
	Than as your honour and as your renown,	999
	Let me no more from this obedience rise,	999
	Which my most inward true and duteous spirit	999
	Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.	999
	God witness with me, when I here came in,	999
	And found no course of breath within your majesty,	999
	How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,	999
	O, let me in my present wildness die	999
	And never live to show the incredulous world	999
	The noble change that I have purposed!	999
	Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,	999
	And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,	999
	I spake unto this crown as having sense,	999
	And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending	999
	Hath fed upon the body of my father;	999
	Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:	999
	Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,	999
	Preserving life in medicine potable;	999
	But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,	999
	Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,	999
	Accusing it, I put it on my head,	999
	To try with it, as with an enemy	999
	That had before my face murder'd my father,	999
	The quarrel of a true inheritor.	999
	But if it did infect my blood with joy,	999
	Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;	999
	If any rebel or vain spirit of mine	999
	Did with the least affection of a welcome	999
	Give entertainment to the might of it,	999
	Let God for ever keep it from my head	999
	And make me as the poorest vassal is	999
	That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	O my son,	999
	God put it in thy mind to take it hence,	999
	That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,	999
	Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!	999
	Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;	999
	And hear, I think, the very latest counsel	999
	That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,	999
	By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways	999
	I met this crown; and I myself know well	999
	How troublesome it sat upon my head.	999
	To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,	999
	Better opinion, better confirmation;	999
	For all the soil of the achievement goes	999
	With me into the earth. It seem'd in me	999
	But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,	999
	And I had many living to upbraid	999
	My gain of it by their assistances;	999
	Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,	999
	Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears	999
	Thou see'st with peril I have answered;	999
	For all my reign hath been but as a scene	999
	Acting that argument: and now my death	999
	Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,	999
	Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;	999
	So thou the garland wear'st successively.	999
	Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,	999
	Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;	999
	And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,	999
	Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;	999
	By whose fell working I was first advanced	999
	And by whose power I well might lodge a fear	999
	To be again displaced: which to avoid,	999
	I cut them off; and had a purpose now	999
	To lead out many to the Holy Land,	999
	Lest rest and lying still might make them look	999
	Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,	999
	Be it thy course to busy giddy minds	999
	With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,	999
	May waste the memory of the former days.	999
	More would I, but my lungs are wasted so	999
	That strength of speech is utterly denied me.	999
	How I came by the crown, O God forgive;	999
	And grant it may with thee in true peace live!	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	My gracious liege,	999
	You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;	999
	Then plain and right must my possession be:	999
	Which I with more than with a common pain	999
	'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.	999
	999
	[Enter Lord John of LANCASTER]	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.	999
	999
LANCASTER	Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father!	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Thou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John;	999
	But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown	999
	From this bare wither'd trunk: upon thy sight	999
	My worldly business makes a period.	999
	Where is my Lord of Warwick?	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	My Lord of Warwick!	999
	999
	[Enter WARWICK, and others]	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Doth any name particular belong	999
	Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?	999
	999
WARWICK	'Tis call'd Jerusalem, my noble lord.	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	Laud be to God! even there my life must end.	999
	It hath been prophesied to me many years,	999
	I should not die but in Jerusalem;	999
	Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land:	999
	But bear me to that chamber; there I'll lie;	999

SCENE I	Gloucestershire. SHALLOW'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter SHALLOW, FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, and Page]	999
	999
SHALLOW	By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away to-night.	999
	What, Davy, I say!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.	999
	999
SHALLOW	I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused;	999
	excuses shall not be admitted; there is no excuse	999
	shall serve; you shall not be excused. Why, Davy!	999
	999
	[Enter DAVY]	999
	999
DAVY	Here, sir.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy; let me	999
	see, Davy; let me see: yea, marry, William cook,	999
	bid him come hither. Sir John, you shall not be excused.	999
	999
DAVY	Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be served:	999
	and, again, sir, shall we sow the headland with wheat?	999
	999
SHALLOW	With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook: are	999
	there no young pigeons?	999
	999
DAVY	Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeing	999
	and plough-irons.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Let it be cast and paid. Sir John, you shall not be excused.	999
	999
DAVY	Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must need be	999
	had: and, sir, do you mean to stop any of William's	999
	wages, about the sack he lost the other day at	999
	Hinckley fair?	999
	999
SHALLOW	A' shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple	999
	of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and any	999
	pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.	999
	999
DAVY	Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?	999
	999
SHALLOW	Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' the	999
	court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men	999
	well, Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.	999
	999
DAVY	No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they	999
	have marvellous foul linen.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Well conceited, Davy: about thy business, Davy.	999
	999
DAVY	I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of	999
	Woncot against Clement Perkes of the hill.	999
	999
SHALLOW	There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor:	999
	that Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.	999
	999
DAVY	I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but	999
	yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some	999
	countenance at his friend's request. An honest	999
	man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave	999
	is not. I have served your worship truly, sir,	999
	this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in	999
	a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I	999
	have but a very little credit with your worship. The	999
	knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, I	999
	beseech your worship, let him be countenanced.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look about, Davy.	999
	999
	[Exit DAVY]	999
	999
	Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, off	999
	with your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	I am glad to see your worship.	999
	999
SHALLOW	I thank thee with all my heart, kind	999
	Master Bardolph: and welcome, my tall fellow.	999
	999
	[To the Page]	999
	999
	Come, Sir John.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I'll follow you, good Master Robert Shallow.	999
	999
	[Exit SHALLOW]	999
	999
	Bardolph, look to our horses.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page]	999
	999
	If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four	999
	dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master	999
	Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the	999
	semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his:	999
	they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like	999
	foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is	999
	turned into a justice-like serving-man: their	999
	spirits are so married in conjunction with the	999
	participation of society that they flock together in	999
	consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit	999
	to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the	999
	imputation of being near their master: if to his	999
	men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man	999
	could better command his servants. It is certain	999
	that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is	999
	caught, as men take diseases, one of another:	999
	therefore let men take heed of their company. I	999
	will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to	999
	keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing	999
	out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two	999
	actions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,	999
	it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest	999
	with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never	999
	had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him	999
	laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!	999
	999
SHALLOW	[Within]  Sir John!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow.	999

SCENE II	Westminster. The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter WARWICK and the Lord Chief-Justice, meeting]	999
	999
WARWICK	How now, my lord chief-justice! whither away?	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	How doth the king?	999
	999
WARWICK	Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	I hope, not dead.	999
	999
WARWICK	He's walk'd the way of nature;	999
	And to our purposes he lives no more.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	I would his majesty had call'd me with him:	999
	The service that I truly did his life	999
	Hath left me open to all injuries.	999
	999
WARWICK	Indeed I think the young king loves you not.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	I know he doth not, and do arm myself	999
	To welcome the condition of the time,	999
	Which cannot look more hideously upon me	999
	Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.	999
	999
	[Enter LANCASTER, CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER,	999
	WESTMORELAND, and others]	999
	999
WARWICK	Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry:	999
	O that the living Harry had the temper	999
	Of him, the worst of these three gentlemen!	999
	How many nobles then should hold their places	999
	That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	O God, I fear all will be overturn'd!	999
	999
LANCASTER	Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.	999
	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	|	999
	|  Good morrow, cousin.	999
CLARENCE	|	999
	999
	999
LANCASTER	We meet like men that had forgot to speak.	999
	999
WARWICK	We do remember; but our argument	999
	Is all too heavy to admit much talk.	999
	999
LANCASTER	Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed;	999
	And I dare swear you borrow not that face	999
	Of seeming sorrow, it is sure your own.	999
	999
LANCASTER	Though no man be assured what grace to find,	999
	You stand in coldest expectation:	999
	I am the sorrier; would 'twere otherwise.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair;	999
	Which swims against your stream of quality.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Sweet princes, what I did, I did in honour,	999
	Led by the impartial conduct of my soul:	999
	And never shall you see that I will beg	999
	A ragged and forestall'd remission.	999
	If truth and upright innocency fail me,	999
	I'll to the king my master that is dead,	999
	And tell him who hath sent me after him.	999
	999
WARWICK	Here comes the prince.	999
	999
	[Enter KING HENRY V, attended]	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Good morrow; and God save your majesty!	999
	999
KING HENRY V	This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,	999
	Sits not so easy on me as you think.	999
	Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:	999
	This is the English, not the Turkish court;	999
	Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,	999
	But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,	999
	For, by my faith, it very well becomes you:	999
	Sorrow so royally in you appears	999
	That I will deeply put the fashion on	999
	And wear it in my heart: why then, be sad;	999
	But entertain no more of it, good brothers,	999
	Than a joint burden laid upon us all.	999
	For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,	999
	I'll be your father and your brother too;	999
	Let me but bear your love, I 'll bear your cares:	999
	Yet weep that Harry's dead; and so will I;	999
	But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears	999
	By number into hours of happiness.	999
	999
Princes	We hope no other from your majesty.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	You all look strangely on me: and you most;	999
	You are, I think, assured I love you not.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	I am assured, if I be measured rightly,	999
	Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	No!	999
	How might a prince of my great hopes forget	999
	So great indignities you laid upon me?	999
	What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison	999
	The immediate heir of England! Was this easy?	999
	May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	I then did use the person of your father;	999
	The image of his power lay then in me:	999
	And, in the administration of his law,	999
	Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,	999
	Your highness pleased to forget my place,	999
	The majesty and power of law and justice,	999
	The image of the king whom I presented,	999
	And struck me in my very seat of judgment;	999
	Whereon, as an offender to your father,	999
	I gave bold way to my authority	999
	And did commit you. If the deed were ill,	999
	Be you contented, wearing now the garland,	999
	To have a son set your decrees at nought,	999
	To pluck down justice from your awful bench,	999
	To trip the course of law and blunt the sword	999
	That guards the peace and safety of your person;	999
	Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image	999
	And mock your workings in a second body.	999
	Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;	999
	Be now the father and propose a son,	999
	Hear your own dignity so much profaned,	999
	See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,	999
	Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;	999
	And then imagine me taking your part	999
	And in your power soft silencing your son:	999
	After this cold considerance, sentence me;	999
	And, as you are a king, speak in your state	999
	What I have done that misbecame my place,	999
	My person, or my liege's sovereignty.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;	999
	Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:	999
	And I do wish your honours may increase,	999
	Till you do live to see a son of mine	999
	Offend you and obey you, as I did.	999
	So shall I live to speak my father's words:	999
	'Happy am I, that have a man so bold,	999
	That dares do justice on my proper son;	999
	And not less happy, having such a son,	999
	That would deliver up his greatness so	999
	Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:	999
	For which, I do commit into your hand	999
	The unstained sword that you have used to bear;	999
	With this remembrance, that you use the same	999
	With the like bold, just and impartial spirit	999
	As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.	999
	You shall be as a father to my youth:	999
	My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,	999
	And I will stoop and humble my intents	999
	To your well-practised wise directions.	999
	And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;	999
	My father is gone wild into his grave,	999
	For in his tomb lie my affections;	999
	And with his spirit sadly I survive,	999
	To mock the expectation of the world,	999
	To frustrate prophecies and to raze out	999
	Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down	999
	After my seeming. The tide of blood in me	999
	Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:	999
	Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,	999
	Where it shall mingle with the state of floods	999
	And flow henceforth in formal majesty.	999
	Now call we our high court of parliament:	999
	And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,	999
	That the great body of our state may go	999
	In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;	999
	That war, or peace, or both at once, may be	999
	As things acquainted and familiar to us;	999
	In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.	999
	Our coronation done, we will accite,	999
	As I before remember'd, all our state:	999
	And, God consigning to my good intents,	999
	No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,	999
	God shorten Harry's happy life one day!	999

SHALLOW	Nay, you shall see my orchard, where, in an arbour,	999
	we will eat a last year's pippin of my own graffing,	999
	with a dish of caraways, and so forth: come,	999
	cousin Silence: and then to bed.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	'Fore God, you have here a goodly dwelling and a rich.	999

	999
SHALLOW	A good varlet, a good varlet, a very good varlet,	999

	[Singing]	999

	And praise God for the merry year;	999

	So merrily,	999
	And ever among so merrily.	999

FALSTAFF	There's a merry heart! Good Master Silence, I'll	999

	'Tis merry in hall when beards wag all,	999
	And welcome merry Shrove-tide.	999
	Be merry, be merry.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I did not think Master Silence had been a man of	999

	[To the Page]	999

	And welcome indeed too. I'll drink to Master	999
	Bardolph, and to all the cavaleros about London.	999

	999
BARDOLPH	An I might see you there, Davy,--	999
	999
SHALLOW	By the mass, you'll crack a quart together, ha!	999
	Will you not, Master Bardolph?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Yea, sir, in a pottle-pot.	999
	999
SHALLOW	By God's liggens, I thank thee: the knave will	999
	stick by thee, I can assure thee that. A' will not	999
	out; he is true bred.	999

	999
PISTOL	Sir John, God save you!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	What wind blew you hither, Pistol?	999
	999
PISTOL	Not the ill wind which blows no man to good. Sweet	999
	knight, thou art now one of the greatest men in this realm.	999
	999
SILENCE	By'r lady, I think a' be, but goodman Puff of Barson.	999
	999
PISTOL	Puff!	999
	Puff in thy teeth, most recreant coward base!	999
	Sir John, I am thy Pistol and thy friend,	999
	And helter-skelter have I rode to thee,	999
	And tidings do I bring and lucky joys	999
	And golden times and happy news of price.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I pray thee now, deliver them like a man of this world.	999
	999
PISTOL	A foutre for the world and worldlings base!	999
	I speak of Africa and golden joys.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	O base Assyrian knight, what is thy news?	999
	Let King Cophetua know the truth thereof.	999
	999
SILENCE	And Robin Hood, Scarlet, and John.	999
	999
	[Singing]	999
	999
PISTOL	Shall dunghill curs confront the Helicons?	999
	And shall good news be baffled?	999
	Then, Pistol, lay thy head in Furies' lap.	999
	999
SILENCE	Honest gentleman, I know not your breeding.	999
	999
PISTOL	Why then, lament therefore.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Give me pardon, sir: if, sir, you come with news	999
	from the court, I take it there's but two ways,	999
	either to utter them, or to conceal them. I am,	999
	sir, under the king, in some authority.	999
	999
PISTOL	Under which king, Besonian? speak, or die.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Under King Harry.	999
	999
PISTOL	                  Harry the Fourth? or Fifth?	999
	999
SHALLOW	Harry the Fourth.	999
	999
PISTOL	A foutre for thine office!	999
	Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is king;	999
	Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth:	999
	When Pistol lies, do this; and fig me, like	999
	The bragging Spaniard.	999

FALSTAFF	What, is the old king dead?	999
	999
PISTOL	As nail in door: the things I speak are just.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Away, Bardolph! saddle my horse. Master Robert	999
	Shallow, choose what office thou wilt in the land,	999
	'tis thine. Pistol, I will double-charge thee with dignities.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	O joyful day!	999
	I would not take a knighthood for my fortune.	999
	999
PISTOL	What! I do bring good news.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Carry Master Silence to bed. Master Shallow, my	999
	Lord Shallow,--be what thou wilt; I am fortune's	999
	steward--get on thy boots: we'll ride all night.	999
	O sweet Pistol! Away, Bardolph!	999
	999
	[Exit BARDOLPH]	999
	999
	Come, Pistol, utter more to me; and withal devise	999
	something to do thyself good. Boot, boot, Master	999
	Shallow: I know the young king is sick for me. Let	999
	us take any man's horses; the laws of England are at	999
	my commandment. Blessed are they that have been my	999
	friends; and woe to my lord chief-justice!	999

	[Enter Beadles, dragging in HOSTESS QUICKLY	999
	and DOLL TEARSHEET]	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	No, thou arrant knave; I would to God that I might	999
	die, that I might have thee hanged: thou hast	999
	drawn my shoulder out of joint.	999
	999
First Beadle	The constables have delivered her over to me; and	999
	she shall have whipping-cheer enough, I warrant	999
	her: there hath been a man or two lately killed about her.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Nut-hook, nut-hook, you lie. Come on; I 'll tell	999
	thee what, thou damned tripe-visaged rascal, an	999
	the child I now go with do miscarry, thou wert	999
	better thou hadst struck thy mother, thou	999
	paper-faced villain.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	O the Lord, that Sir John were come! he would make	999
	this a bloody day to somebody. But I pray God the	999
	fruit of her womb miscarry!	999
	999
First Beadle	If it do, you shall have a dozen of cushions again;	999
	you have but eleven now. Come, I charge you both go	999
	with me; for the man is dead that you and Pistol	999
	beat amongst you.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	I'll tell you what, you thin man in a censer, I	999
	will have you as soundly swinged for this,--you	999
	blue-bottle rogue, you filthy famished correctioner,	999
	if you be not swinged, I'll forswear half-kirtles.	999
	999
First Beadle	Come, come, you she knight-errant, come.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	O God, that right should thus overcome might!	999
	Well, of sufferance comes ease.	999
	999
DOLL TEARSHEET	Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice.	999
	999
MISTRESS QUICKLY	Ay, come, you starved blood-hound.	999

	[Enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, PISTOL,	999
	BARDOLPH, and Page]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow; I will	999
	make the king do you grace: I will leer upon him as	999
	a' comes by; and do but mark the countenance that he	999
	will give me.	999
	999
PISTOL	God bless thy lungs, good knight.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Come here, Pistol; stand behind me. O, if I had had	999
	time to have made new liveries, I would have	999
	bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But	999
	'tis no matter; this poor show doth better: this	999
	doth infer the zeal I had to see him.	999
	999
SHALLOW	It doth so.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	It shows my earnestness of affection,--	999
	999
SHALLOW	It doth so.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My devotion,--	999
	999
SHALLOW	It doth, it doth, it doth.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	As it were, to ride day and night; and not to	999
	deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience	999
	to shift me,--	999
	999
SHALLOW	It is best, certain.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with	999
	desire to see him; thinking of nothing else,	999
	putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there	999
	were nothing else to be done but to see him.	999
	999
PISTOL	'Tis 'semper idem,' for 'obsque hoc nihil est:'	999
	'tis all in every part.	999
	999
SHALLOW	'Tis so, indeed.	999
	999
PISTOL	My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver,	999
	And make thee rage.	999
	Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts,	999
	Is in base durance and contagious prison;	999
	Haled thither	999
	By most mechanical and dirty hand:	999
	Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell	999
	Alecto's snake,	999
	For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	I will deliver her.	999

PISTOL	The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of fame!	999
	999
FALSTAFF	God save thee, my sweet boy!	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	My lord chief-justice, speak to that vain man.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	Have you your wits? know you what 'tis to speak?	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My king! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!	999
	999
KING HENRY IV	I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;	999
	How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!	999
	I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,	999
	So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane;	999
	But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.	999
	Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;	999
	Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape	999
	For thee thrice wider than for other men.	999
	Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:	999
	Presume not that I am the thing I was;	999
	For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,	999
	That I have turn'd away my former self;	999
	So will I those that kept me company.	999
	When thou dost hear I am as I have been,	999
	Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,	999
	The tutor and the feeder of my riots:	999
	Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,	999
	As I have done the rest of my misleaders,	999
	Not to come near our person by ten mile.	999
	For competence of life I will allow you,	999
	That lack of means enforce you not to evil:	999
	And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,	999
	We will, according to your strengths and qualities,	999
	Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,	999
	To see perform'd the tenor of our word. Set on.	999
	999
	[Exeunt KING HENRY V, &c]	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound.	999
	999
SHALLOW	Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me	999
	have home with me.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you	999
	grieve at this; I shall be sent for in private to	999
	him: look you, he must seem thus to the world:	999
	fear not your advancements; I will be the man yet	999
	that shall make you great.	999
	999
SHALLOW	I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give	999
	me your doublet and stuff me out with straw. I	999
	beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred	999
	of my thousand.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Sir, I will be as good as my word: this that you	999
	heard was but a colour.	999
	999
SHALLOW	A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	Fear no colours: go with me to dinner: come,	999
	Lieutenant Pistol; come, Bardolph: I shall be sent	999
	for soon at night.	999

	[Re-enter Prince John of LANCASTER, the Lord	999

	Take all his company along with him.	999
	999
FALSTAFF	My lord, my lord,--	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	I cannot now speak: I will hear you soon.	999
	Take them away.	999

PISTOL	Si fortune me tormenta, spero contenta.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but PRINCE JOHN and the Lord	999
	Chief-Justice]	999
	999
LANCASTER	I like this fair proceeding of the king's:	999
	He hath intent his wonted followers	999
	Shall all be very well provided for;	999
	But all are banish'd till their conversations	999
	Appear more wise and modest to the world.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	And so they are.	999
	999
LANCASTER	The king hath call'd his parliament, my lord.	999
	999
Lord Chief-Justice	He hath.	999
	999
LANCASTER	I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,	999
	We bear our civil swords and native fire	999
	As far as France: I beard a bird so sing,	999
	Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the king.	999

	999
	EPILOGUE	999
	999
	999
	[Spoken by a Dancer]	999
	999
	First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.	999
	My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;	999
	and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look	999
	for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have	999
	to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I	999
	should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.	999
	But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it	999
	known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here	999
	in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your	999
	patience for it and to promise you a better. I	999
	meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an	999
	ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and	999
	you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you	999
	I would be and here I commit my body to your	999
	mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,	999
	as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.	999
	999
	If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will	999
	you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but	999
	light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a	999
	good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,	999
	and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have	999
	forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the	999
	gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which	999
	was never seen before in such an assembly.	999
	999
	One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too	999
	much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will	999
	continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make	999
	you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for	999
	any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,	999
	unless already a' be killed with your hard	999
	opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is	999
	not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are	999
	too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down	999
	before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.	999

	CARDINAL, on the one side; QUEEN MARGARET, SUFFOLK,	999
	YORK, SOMERSET, and BUCKINGHAM, on the other]	999
	999
SUFFOLK	As by your high imperial majesty	999
	I had in charge at my depart for France,	999
	As procurator to your excellence,	999
	To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,	999
	So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,	999
	In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,	999
	The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon,	999
	Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,	999
	I have perform'd my task and was espoused:	999
	And humbly now upon my bended knee,	999
	In sight of England and her lordly peers,	999
	Deliver up my title in the queen	999
	To your most gracious hands, that are the substance	999
	Of that great shadow I did represent;	999
	The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,	999
	The fairest queen that ever king received.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:	999
	I can express no kinder sign of love	999
	Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,	999
	Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!	999
	For thou hast given me in this beauteous face	999
	A world of earthly blessings to my soul,	999
	If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Great King of England and my gracious lord,	999
	The mutual conference that my mind hath had,	999
	By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,	999
	In courtly company or at my beads,	999
	With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign,	999
	Makes me the bolder to salute my king	999
	With ruder terms, such as my wit affords	999
	And over-joy of heart doth minister.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,	999
	Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,	999
	Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys;	999
	Such is the fulness of my heart's content.	999
	Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.	999
	999
ALL	[Kneeling]  Long live Queen Margaret, England's	999

	the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret,	999

KING HENRY VI	Uncle, how now!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	       Pardon me, gracious lord;	999
	Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart	999
	And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.	999

	proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.'	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel down:	999
	We here create thee the first duke of Suffolk,	999
	And gird thee with the sword. Cousin of York,	999
	We here discharge your grace from being regent	999
	I' the parts of France, till term of eighteen months	999
	Be full expired. Thanks, uncle Winchester,	999
	Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,	999

GLOUCESTER	Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,	999
	To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,	999
	Your grief, the common grief of all the land.	999
	What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,	999
	His valour, coin and people, in the wars?	999
	Did he so often lodge in open field,	999
	In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,	999
	To conquer France, his true inheritance?	999
	And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,	999
	To keep by policy what Henry got?	999
	Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,	999
	Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,	999
	Received deep scars in France and Normandy?	999
	Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,	999
	With all the learned council of the realm,	999
	Studied so long, sat in the council-house	999
	Early and late, debating to and fro	999
	How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,	999
	And had his highness in his infancy	999
	Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?	999
	And shall these labours and these honours die?	999
	Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,	999
	Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?	999
	O peers of England, shameful is this league!	999
	Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,	999
	Blotting your names from books of memory,	999
	Razing the characters of your renown,	999
	Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,	999
	Undoing all, as all had never been!	999
	999
CARDINAL	Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,	999
	This peroration with such circumstance?	999
	For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;	999
	But now it is impossible we should:	999
	Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,	999
	Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine	999
	Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style	999
	Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Now, by the death of Him that died for all,	999
	These counties were the keys of Normandy.	999
	But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?	999
	999
WARWICK	For grief that they are past recovery:	999
	For, were there hope to conquer them again,	999
	My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.	999
	Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;	999
	Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:	999
	And are the cities, that I got with wounds,	999
	Delivered up again with peaceful words?	999
	Mort Dieu!	999
	999
YORK	For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,	999
	That dims the honour of this warlike isle!	999
	France should have torn and rent my very heart,	999
	Before I would have yielded to this league.	999
	I never read but England's kings have had	999
	Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:	999
	And our King Henry gives away his own,	999
	To match with her that brings no vantages.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	A proper jest, and never heard before,	999
	That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth	999
	For costs and charges in transporting her!	999
	She should have stayed in France and starved	999
	in France, Before--	999
	999
CARDINAL	My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:	999
	It was the pleasure of my lord the King.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;	999
	'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,	999
	But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.	999
	Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face	999
	I see thy fury: if I longer stay,	999
	We shall begin our ancient bickerings.	999
	Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,	999
	I prophesied France will be lost ere long.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CARDINAL	So, there goes our protector in a rage.	999
	'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,	999
	Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,	999
	And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.	999
	Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,	999
	And heir apparent to the English crown:	999
	Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,	999
	And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,	999
	There's reason he should be displeased at it.	999
	Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words	999
	Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.	999
	What though the common people favour him,	999
	Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of	999
	Gloucester,'	999
	Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,	999
	'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'	999
	With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'	999
	I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,	999
	He will be found a dangerous protector.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,	999
	He being of age to govern of himself?	999
	Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,	999
	And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,	999
	We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.	999
	999
CARDINAL	This weighty business will not brook delay:	999
	I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
SOMERSET	Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride	999
	And greatness of his place be grief to us,	999
	Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:	999
	His insolence is more intolerable	999
	Than all the princes in the land beside:	999
	If Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,	999
	Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.	999
	999
	[Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET]	999
	999
SALISBURY	Pride went before, ambition follows him.	999
	While these do labour for their own preferment,	999
	Behoves it us to labour for the realm.	999
	I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester	999
	Did bear him like a noble gentleman.	999
	Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,	999
	More like a soldier than a man o' the church,	999
	As stout and proud as he were lord of all,	999
	Swear like a ruffian and demean himself	999
	Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.	999
	Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,	999
	Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,	999
	Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,	999
	Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:	999
	And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,	999
	In bringing them to civil discipline,	999
	Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,	999
	When thou wert regent for our sovereign,	999
	Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:	999
	Join we together, for the public good,	999
	In what we can, to bridle and suppress	999
	The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,	999
	With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;	999
	And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,	999
	While they do tend the profit of the land.	999
	999
WARWICK	So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,	999
	And common profit of his country!	999
	999
YORK	[Aside]  And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main.	999
	999
WARWICK	Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;	999
	That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,	999
	And would have kept so long as breath did last!	999
	Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,	999
	Which I will win from France, or else be slain,	999
	999
	[Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY]	999
	999
YORK	Anjou and Maine are given to the French;	999
	Paris is lost; the state of Normandy	999
	Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:	999
	Suffolk concluded on the articles,	999
	The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased	999
	To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.	999
	I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?	999
	'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.	999
	Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage	999
	And purchase friends and give to courtezans,	999
	Still revelling like lords till all be gone;	999
	While as the silly owner of the goods	999
	Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands	999
	And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,	999
	While all is shared and all is borne away,	999
	Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:	999
	So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,	999
	While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.	999
	Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland	999
	Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood	999
	As did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd	999
	Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.	999
	Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!	999
	Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,	999
	Even as I have of fertile England's soil.	999
	A day will come when York shall claim his own;	999
	And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts	999
	And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,	999
	And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,	999
	For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:	999
	Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,	999
	Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,	999
	Nor wear the diadem upon his head,	999
	Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.	999
	Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:	999
	Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,	999
	To pry into the secrets of the state;	999
	Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,	999
	With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,	999
	And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:	999
	Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,	999
	With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;	999
	And in my standard bear the arms of York	999
	To grapple with the house of Lancaster;	999
	And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,	999
	Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.	999

	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	GLOUCESTER'S house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER and his DUCHESS]	999
	999
DUCHESS	Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,	999
	Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?	999
	Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,	999
	As frowning at the favours of the world?	999
	Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,	999
	Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?	999
	What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,	999
	Enchased with all the honours of the world?	999
	If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,	999
	Until thy head be circled with the same.	999
	Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.	999
	What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine:	999
	And, having both together heaved it up,	999
	We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,	999
	And never more abase our sight so low	999
	As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,	999
	Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.	999
	And may that thought, when I imagine ill	999
	Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,	999
	Be my last breathing in this mortal world!	999
	My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.	999
	999
DUCHESS	What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite it	999
	With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,	999
	Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,	999
	But, as I think, it was by the cardinal;	999
	And on the pieces of the broken wand	999
	Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,	999
	And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk.	999
	This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.	999
	999
DUCHESS	Tut, this was nothing but an argument	999
	That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove	999
	Shall lose his head for his presumption.	999
	But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:	999
	Methought I sat in seat of majesty	999
	In the cathedral church of Westminster,	999
	And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;	999
	Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me	999
	And on my head did set the diadem.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:	999
	Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,	999
	Art thou not second woman in the realm,	999
	And the protector's wife, beloved of him?	999
	Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,	999
	Above the reach or compass of thy thought?	999
	And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,	999
	To tumble down thy husband and thyself	999
	From top of honour to disgrace's feet?	999
	Away from me, and let me hear no more!	999
	999
DUCHESS	What, what, my lord! are you so choleric	999
	With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?	999
	Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,	999
	And not be cheque'd.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.	999
	999
	[Enter Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	My lord protector, 'tis his highness' pleasure	999
	You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's,	999
	Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?	999
	999
DUCHESS	Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.	999
	999
	[Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Messenger]	999
	999
	Follow I must; I cannot go before,	999
	While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.	999
	Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,	999
	I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks	999
	And smooth my way upon their headless necks;	999
	And, being a woman, I will not be slack	999
	To play my part in Fortune's pageant.	999
	Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,	999
	We are alone; here's none but thee and I.	999
	999
	[Enter HUME]	999
	999
HUME	Jesus preserve your royal majesty!	999
	999
DUCHESS	What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.	999
	999
HUME	But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice,	999
	Your grace's title shall be multiplied.	999
	999
DUCHESS	What say'st thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr'd	999
	With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,	999
	With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?	999
	And will they undertake to do me good?	999
	999
HUME	This they have promised, to show your highness	999
	A spirit raised from depth of under-ground,	999
	That shall make answer to such questions	999
	As by your grace shall be propounded him.	999
	999
DUCHESS	It is enough; I'll think upon the questions:	999
	When from St. Alban's we do make return,	999
	We'll see these things effected to the full.	999
	Here, Hume, take this reward; make merry, man,	999
	With thy confederates in this weighty cause.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HUME	Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;	999
	Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!	999
	Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:	999
	The business asketh silent secrecy.	999
	Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:	999
	Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.	999
	Yet have I gold flies from another coast;	999
	I dare not say, from the rich cardinal	999
	And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,	999
	Yet I do find it so; for to be plain,	999
	They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,	999
	Have hired me to undermine the duchess	999
	And buz these conjurations in her brain.	999
	They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker;'	999
	Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.	999
	Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near	999
	To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.	999
	Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at last	999
	Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck,	999
	And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall:	999
	Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter three or four Petitioners, PETER, the	999
	Armourer's man, being one]	999
	999
First Petitioner	My masters, let's stand close: my lord protector	999
	will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver	999
	our supplications in the quill.	999
	999
Second Petitioner	Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good man!	999
	Jesu bless him!	999
	999
	[Enter SUFFOLK and QUEEN MARGARET]	999
	999
PETER	Here a' comes, methinks, and the queen with him.	999
	I'll be the first, sure.	999
	999
Second Petitioner	Come back, fool; this is the Duke of Suffolk, and	999
	not my lord protector.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	How now, fellow! would'st anything with me?	999
	999
First Petitioner	I pray, my lord, pardon me; I took ye for my lord	999
	protector.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	[Reading]  'To my Lord Protector!' Are your	999
	supplications to his lordship? Let me see them:	999
	what is thine?	999
	999
First Petitioner	Mine is, an't please your grace, against John	999
	Goodman, my lord cardinal's man, for keeping my	999
	house, and lands, and wife and all, from me.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Thy wife, too! that's some wrong, indeed. What's	999
	yours? What's here!	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing the	999
	commons of Melford.' How now, sir knave!	999
	999
Second Petitioner	Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township.	999
	999
PETER	[Giving his petition]  Against my master, Thomas	999
	Horner, for saying that the Duke of York was rightful	999
	heir to the crown.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	What sayst thou? did the Duke of York say he was	999
	rightful heir to the crown?	999
	999
PETER	That my master was? no, forsooth: my master said	999
	that he was, and that the king was an usurper.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Who is there?	999
	999
	[Enter Servant]	999
	999
	Take this fellow in, and send for	999
	his master with a pursuivant presently: we'll hear	999
	more of your matter before the King.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant with PETER]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	And as for you, that love to be protected	999
	Under the wings of our protector's grace,	999
	Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.	999
	999
	[Tears the supplication]	999
	999
	Away, base cullions! Suffolk, let them go.	999
	999
ALL	Come, let's be gone.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,	999
	Is this the fashion in the court of England?	999
	Is this the government of Britain's isle,	999
	And this the royalty of Albion's king?	999
	What shall King Henry be a pupil still	999
	Under the surly Gloucester's governance?	999
	Am I a queen in title and in style,	999
	And must be made a subject to a duke?	999
	I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours	999
	Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love	999
	And stolest away the ladies' hearts of France,	999
	I thought King Henry had resembled thee	999
	In courage, courtship and proportion:	999
	But all his mind is bent to holiness,	999
	To number Ave-Maries on his beads;	999
	His champions are the prophets and apostles,	999
	His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,	999
	His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves	999
	Are brazen images of canonized saints.	999
	I would the college of the cardinals	999
	Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,	999
	And set the triple crown upon his head:	999
	That were a state fit for his holiness.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Madam, be patient: as I was cause	999
	Your highness came to England, so will I	999
	In England work your grace's full content.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Beside the haughty protector, have we Beaufort,	999
	The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,	999
	And grumbling York: and not the least of these	999
	But can do more in England than the king.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	And he of these that can do most of all	999
	Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:	999
	Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Not all these lords do vex me half so much	999
	As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife.	999
	She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,	999
	More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife:	999
	Strangers in court do take her for the queen:	999
	She bears a duke's revenues on her back,	999
	And in her heart she scorns our poverty:	999
	Shall I not live to be avenged on her?	999
	Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,	999
	She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day,	999
	The very train of her worst wearing gown	999
	Was better worth than all my father's lands,	999
	Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Madam, myself have limed a bush for her,	999
	And placed a quire of such enticing birds,	999
	That she will light to listen to the lays,	999
	And never mount to trouble you again.	999
	So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me;	999
	For I am bold to counsel you in this.	999
	Although we fancy not the cardinal,	999
	Yet must we join with him and with the lords,	999
	Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.	999
	As for the Duke of York, this late complaint	999
	Will make but little for his benefit.	999
	So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,	999
	And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.	999

	[Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER,	999
	CARDINAL, BUCKINGHAM, YORK, SOMERSET, SALISBURY,	999
	WARWICK, and the DUCHESS]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	For my part, noble lords, I care not which;	999
	Or Somerset or York, all's one to me.	999
	999
YORK	If York have ill demean'd himself in France,	999
	Then let him be denay'd the regentship.	999
	999
SOMERSET	If Somerset be unworthy of the place,	999
	Let York be regent; I will yield to him.	999
	999
WARWICK	Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,	999
	Dispute not that: York is the worthier.	999
	999
CARDINAL	Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.	999
	999
WARWICK	The cardinal's not my better in the field.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.	999
	999
WARWICK	Warwick may live to be the best of all.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Peace, son! and show some reason, Buckingham,	999
	Why Somerset should be preferred in this.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Madam, the king is old enough himself	999
	To give his censure: these are no women's matters.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	If he be old enough, what needs your grace	999
	To be protector of his excellence?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Madam, I am protector of the realm;	999
	And, at his pleasure, will resign my place.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Resign it then and leave thine insolence.	999
	Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--	999
	The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck;	999
	The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;	999
	And all the peers and nobles of the realm	999
	Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.	999
	999
CARDINAL	The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags	999
	Are lank and lean with thy extortions.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire	999
	Have cost a mass of public treasury.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Thy cruelty in execution	999
	Upon offenders, hath exceeded law,	999
	And left thee to the mercy of the law.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	They sale of offices and towns in France,	999
	If they were known, as the suspect is great,	999
	Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.	999
	999
	[Exit GLOUCESTER. QUEEN MARGARET drops her fan]	999
	999
	Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?	999
	999
	[She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear]	999
	999
	I cry you mercy, madam; was it you?	999
	999
DUCHESS	Was't I! yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman:	999
	Could I come near your beauty with my nails,	999
	I'd set my ten commandments in your face.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.	999
	999
DUCHESS	Against her will! good king, look to't in time;	999
	She'll hamper thee, and dandle thee like a baby:	999
	Though in this place most master wear no breeches,	999
	She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Lord cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,	999
	And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds:	999
	She's tickled now; her fume needs no spurs,	999
	She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Re-enter GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Now, lords, my choler being over-blown	999
	With walking once about the quadrangle,	999
	I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.	999
	As for your spiteful false objections,	999
	Prove them, and I lie open to the law:	999
	But God in mercy so deal with my soul,	999
	As I in duty love my king and country!	999
	But, to the matter that we have in hand:	999
	I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man	999
	To be your regent in the realm of France.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Before we make election, give me leave	999
	To show some reason, of no little force,	999
	That York is most unmeet of any man.	999
	999
YORK	I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:	999
	First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;	999
	Next, if I be appointed for the place,	999
	My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,	999
	Without discharge, money, or furniture,	999
	Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands:	999
	Last time, I danced attendance on his will	999
	Till Paris was besieged, famish'd, and lost.	999
	999
WARWICK	That can I witness; and a fouler fact	999
	Did never traitor in the land commit.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Peace, headstrong Warwick!	999
	999
WARWICK	Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?	999
	999
	[Enter HORNER, the Armourer, and his man	999
	PETER, guarded]	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Because here is a man accused of treason:	999
	Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!	999
	999
YORK	Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	What mean'st thou, Suffolk; tell me, what are these?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Please it your majesty, this is the man	999
	That doth accuse his master of high treason:	999
	His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,	999
	Was rightful heir unto the English crown	999
	And that your majesty was a usurper.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Say, man, were these thy words?	999
	999
HORNER	An't shall please your majesty, I never said nor	999
	thought any such matter: God is my witness, I am	999
	falsely accused by the villain.	999
	999
PETER	By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to	999
	me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my	999
	Lord of York's armour.	999
	999
YORK	Base dunghill villain and mechanical,	999
	I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.	999
	I do beseech your royal majesty,	999
	Let him have all the rigor of the law.	999
	999
HORNER	Alas, my lord, hang me, if ever I spake the words.	999
	My accuser is my 'prentice; and when I did correct	999
	him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his	999
	knees he would be even with me: I have good	999
	witness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty,	999
	do not cast away an honest man for a villain's	999
	accusation.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	This doom, my lord, if I may judge:	999
	Let Somerset be regent over the French,	999
	Because in York this breeds suspicion:	999
	And let these have a day appointed them	999
	For single combat in convenient place,	999
	For he hath witness of his servant's malice:	999
	This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.	999
	999
SOMERSET	I humbly thank your royal majesty.	999
	999
HORNER	And I accept the combat willingly.	999
	999
PETER	Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity	999
	my case. The spite of man prevaileth against me. O	999
	Lord, have mercy upon me! I shall never be able to	999
	fight a blow. O Lord, my heart!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Sirrah, or you must fight, or else be hang'd.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Away with them to prison; and the day of combat	999
	shall be the last of the next month. Come,	999
	Somerset, we'll see thee sent away.	999

	[Enter MARGARET JOURDAIN, HUME, SOUTHWELL, and	999
	BOLINGBROKE]	999
	999
HUME	Come, my masters; the duchess, I tell you, expects	999
	performance of your promises.	999
	999
BOLINGBROKE	Master Hume, we are therefore provided: will her	999
	ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?	999
	999
HUME	Ay, what else? fear you not her courage.	999
	999
BOLINGBROKE	I have heard her reported to be a woman of an	999
	invincible spirit: but it shall be convenient,	999
	Master Hume, that you be by her aloft, while we be	999
	busy below; and so, I pray you, go, in God's name,	999
	and leave us.	999
	999
	[Exit HUME]	999
	999
	Mother Jourdain, be you	999
	prostrate and grovel on the earth; John Southwell,	999
	read you; and let us to our work.	999
	999
	[Enter the DUCHESS aloft, HUME following]	999
	999
DUCHESS	Well said, my masters; and welcome all. To this	999
	gear the sooner the better.	999
	999
BOLINGBROKE	Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:	999
	Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,	999
	The time of night when Troy was set on fire;	999
	The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,	999
	And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves,	999
	That time best fits the work we have in hand.	999
	Madam, sit you and fear not: whom we raise,	999
	We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.	999
	999
	[Here they do the ceremonies belonging, and make the	999
	circle; BOLINGBROKE or SOUTHWELL reads, Conjuro te,	999
	&c. It thunders and lightens terribly; then the	999

	999
Spirit	Adsum.	999
	999
MARGARET JOURDAIN	Asmath,	999
	By the eternal God, whose name and power	999
	Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;	999
	For, till thou speak, thou shalt not pass from hence.	999
	999
Spirit	Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!	999
	999
BOLINGBROKE	'First of the king: what shall of him become?'	999
	999
	[Reading out of a paper]	999
	999
Spirit	The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;	999
	But him outlive, and die a violent death.	999
	999
	[As the Spirit speaks, SOUTHWELL writes the answer]	999
	999
BOLINGBROKE	'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'	999
	999
Spirit	By water shall he die, and take his end.	999
	999
BOLINGBROKE	'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'	999
	999
Spirit	Let him shun castles;	999
	Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains	999
	Than where castles mounted stand.	999
	Have done, for more I hardly can endure.	999
	999
BOLINGBROKE	Descend to darkness and the burning lake!	999
	False fiend, avoid!	999

	[Thunder and lightning. Exit Spirit]	999

YORK	Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.	999
	Beldam, I think we watch'd you at an inch.	999
	What, madam, are you there? the king and commonweal	999
	Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains:	999
	My lord protector will, I doubt it not,	999
	See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.	999
	999
DUCHESS	Not half so bad as thine to England's king,	999
	Injurious duke, that threatest where's no cause.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	True, madam, none at all: what call you this?	999
	Away with them! let them be clapp'd up close.	999
	And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us.	999
	Stafford, take her to thee.	999
	999
	[Exeunt above DUCHESS and HUME, guarded]	999
	999
	We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.	999
	All, away!	999
	999
	[Exeunt guard with MARGARET JOURDAIN, SOUTHWELL, &c]	999
	999
YORK	Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch'd her well:	999
	A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!	999
	Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.	999
	What have we here?	999
	999
	[Reads]	999
	999
	'The duke yet lives, that Henry shall depose;	999
	But him outlive, and die a violent death.'	999
	Why, this is just	999
	'Aio te, AEacida, Romanos vincere posse.'	999
	Well, to the rest:	999
	'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?	999
	By water shall he die, and take his end.	999
	What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?	999
	Let him shun castles;	999
	Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains	999
	Than where castles mounted stand.'	999
	Come, come, my lords;	999
	These oracles are hardly attain'd,	999
	And hardly understood.	999
	The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's,	999
	With him the husband of this lovely lady:	999
	Thither go these news, as fast as horse can	999
	carry them:	999
	A sorry breakfast for my lord protector.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Your grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,	999
	To be the post, in hope of his reward.	999
	999
YORK	At your pleasure, my good lord. Who's within	999
	there, ho!	999

SCENE I	Saint Alban's.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, GLOUCESTER,	999
	CARDINAL, and SUFFOLK, with Falconers halloing]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,	999
	I saw not better sport these seven years' day:	999
	Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high;	999
	And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,	999
	And what a pitch she flew above the rest!	999
	To see how God in all his creatures works!	999
	Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	No marvel, an it like your majesty,	999
	My lord protector's hawks do tower so well;	999
	They know their master loves to be aloft,	999
	And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind	999
	That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.	999
	999
CARDINAL	I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ay, my lord cardinal? how think you by that?	999
	Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	The treasury of everlasting joy.	999
	999
CARDINAL	Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts	999
	Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart;	999
	Pernicious protector, dangerous peer,	999
	That smooth'st it so with king and commonweal!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What, cardinal, is your priesthood grown peremptory?	999
	Tantaene animis coelestibus irae?	999
	Churchmen so hot? good uncle, hide such malice;	999
	With such holiness can you do it?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	No malice, sir; no more than well becomes	999
	So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	As who, my lord?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	       Why, as you, my lord,	999
	An't like your lordly lord-protectorship.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	And thy ambition, Gloucester.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	I prithee, peace, good queen,	999
	And whet not on these furious peers;	999
	For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.	999
	999
CARDINAL	Let me be blessed for the peace I make,	999
	Against this proud protector, with my sword!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CARDINAL]  Faith, holy uncle, would	999
	'twere come to that!	999
	999
CARDINAL	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Marry, when thou darest.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CARDINAL]  Make up no factious	999
	numbers for the matter;	999
	In thine own person answer thy abuse.	999
	999
CARDINAL	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Ay, where thou darest	999
	not peep: an if thou darest,	999
	This evening, on the east side of the grove.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	How now, my lords!	999
	999
CARDINAL	       Believe me, cousin Gloucester,	999
	Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,	999
	We had had more sport.	999
	999
	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
		 Come with thy two-hand sword.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	True, uncle.	999
	999
CARDINAL	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Are ye advised? the	999
	east side of the grove?	999

GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CARDINAL]  Cardinal, I am with you.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.	999
	999
	[Aside to CARDINAL]	999
	999
	Now, by God's mother, priest, I'll shave your crown for this,	999
	Or all my fence shall fail.	999
	999
CARDINAL	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Medice, teipsum--	999
	Protector, see to't well, protect yourself.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.	999
	How irksome is this music to my heart!	999
	When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?	999
	I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.	999
	999
	[Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban's, crying 'A miracle!']	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What means this noise?	999
	Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?	999
	999
Townsman	A miracle! a miracle!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Come to the king and tell him what miracle.	999
	999
Townsman	Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,	999
	Within this half-hour, hath received his sight;	999
	A man that ne'er saw in his life before.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Now, God be praised, that to believing souls	999
	Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!	999

	To present your highness with the man.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,	999
	Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king;	999
	His highness' pleasure is to talk with him.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,	999
	That we for thee may glorify the Lord.	999
	What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	Born blind, an't please your grace.	999
	999
Wife	Ay, indeed, was he.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	What woman is this?	999
	999
Wife	His wife, an't like your worship.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have	999
	better told.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Where wert thou born?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	At Berwick in the north, an't like your grace.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee:	999
	Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,	999
	But still remember what the Lord hath done.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance,	999
	Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd	999
	A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,	999
	By good Saint Alban; who said, 'Simpcox, come,	999
	Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'	999
	999
Wife	Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft	999
	Myself have heard a voice to call him so.	999
	999
CARDINAL	What, art thou lame?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	Ay, God Almighty help me!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	How camest thou so?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	A fall off of a tree.	999
	999
Wife	A plum-tree, master.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	How long hast thou been blind?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	Born so, master.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	       What, and wouldst climb a tree?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	But that in all my life, when I was a youth.	999
	999
Wife	Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst	999
	venture so.	999
	999
SIMPCOX	Alas, good master, my wife desired some damsons,	999
	And made me climb, with danger of my life.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.	999
	Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them:	999
	In my opinion yet thou seest not well.	999
	999
SIMPCOX	Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and	999
	Saint Alban.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	Red, master; red as blood.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	Black, forsooth: coal-black as jet.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	And yet, I think, jet did he never see.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.	999
	999
Wife	Never, before this day, in all his life.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	Alas, master, I know not.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What's his name?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	I know not.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Nor his?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	No, indeed, master.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What's thine own name?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in	999
	Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou	999
	mightest as well have known all our names as thus to	999
	name the several colours we do wear. Sight may	999
	distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them	999
	all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here	999
	hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his	999
	cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple	999
	to his legs again?	999
	999
SIMPCOX	O master, that you could!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	My masters of Saint Alban's, have you not beadles in	999
	your town, and things called whips?	999
	999
Mayor	Yes, my lord, if it please your grace.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Then send for one presently.	999
	999
Mayor	Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.	999
	999
	[Exit an Attendant]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. Now, sirrah,	999
	if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me	999
	over this stool and run away.	999
	999
SIMPCOX	Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone:	999
	You go about to torture me in vain.	999
	999
	[Enter a Beadle with whips]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Well, sir, we must have you find your legs. Sirrah	999
	beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.	999
	999
Beadle	I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah; off with your	999
	doublet quickly.	999
	999
SIMPCOX	Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.	999
	999
	[After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over	999
	the stool and runs away; and they follow and cry, 'A miracle!']	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	It made me laugh to see the villain run.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Follow the knave; and take this drab away.	999
	999
Wife	Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Let them be whipped through every market-town, till	999
	they come to Berwick, from whence they came.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Wife, Beadle, Mayor, &c]	999
	999
CARDINAL	Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	True; made the lame to leap and fly away.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	But you have done more miracles than I;	999
	You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.	999
	999
	[Enter BUCKINGHAM]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.	999
	A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,	999
	Under the countenance and confederacy	999
	Of Lady Eleanor, the protector's wife,	999
	The ringleader and head of all this rout,	999
	Have practised dangerously against your state,	999
	Dealing with witches and with conjurers:	999
	Whom we have apprehended in the fact;	999
	Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,	999
	Demanding of King Henry's life and death,	999
	And other of your highness' privy-council;	999
	As more at large your grace shall understand.	999
	999
CARDINAL	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  And so, my lord protector,	999
	by this means	999
	Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.	999
	This news, I think, hath turn'd your weapon's edge;	999
	'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart:	999
	Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers;	999
	And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to thee,	999
	Or to the meanest groom.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,	999
	Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest.	999
	And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,	999
	How I have loved my king and commonweal:	999
	And, for my wife, I know not how it stands;	999
	Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:	999
	Noble she is, but if she have forgot	999
	Honour and virtue and conversed with such	999
	As, like to pitch, defile nobility,	999
	I banish her my bed and company	999
	And give her as a prey to law and shame,	999
	That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Well, for this night we will repose us here:	999
	To-morrow toward London back again,	999
	To look into this business thoroughly	999
	And call these foul offenders to their answers	999
	And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,	999
	Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.	999

	999
SCENE II	London. YORK'S garden.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK]	999
	999
YORK	Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,	999
	Our simple supper ended, give me leave	999
	In this close walk to satisfy myself,	999
	In craving your opinion of my title,	999
	Which is infallible, to England's crown.	999
	999
SALISBURY	My lord, I long to hear it at full.	999
	999
WARWICK	Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,	999
	The Nevils are thy subjects to command.	999
	999
YORK	Then thus:	999
	Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:	999
	The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;	999
	The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,	999
	Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom	999
	Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;	999
	The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;	999
	The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;	999
	William of Windsor was the seventh and last.	999
	Edward the Black Prince died before his father	999
	And left behind him Richard, his only son,	999
	Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;	999
	Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,	999
	The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,	999
	Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,	999
	Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,	999
	Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,	999
	And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,	999
	Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.	999
	999
WARWICK	Father, the duke hath told the truth:	999
	Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.	999
	999
YORK	Which now they hold by force and not by right;	999
	For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,	999
	The issue of the next son should have reign'd.	999
	999
SALISBURY	But William of Hatfield died without an heir.	999
	999
YORK	The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line	999
	I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,	999
	Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:	999
	Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;	999
	Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.	999
	999
SALISBURY	This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,	999
	As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;	999
	And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,	999
	Who kept him in captivity till he died.	999
	But to the rest.	999
	999
YORK	       His eldest sister, Anne,	999
	My mother, being heir unto the crown	999
	Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son	999
	To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.	999
	By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir	999
	To Roger Earl of March, who was the son	999
	Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,	999
	Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:	999
	So, if the issue of the elder son	999
	Succeed before the younger, I am king.	999
	999
WARWICK	What plain proceeding is more plain than this?	999
	Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,	999
	The fourth son; York claims it from the third.	999
	Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:	999
	It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee	999
	And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.	999
	Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;	999
	And in this private plot be we the first	999
	That shall salute our rightful sovereign	999
	With honour of his birthright to the crown.	999
	999
BOTH	Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!	999
	999
YORK	We thank you, lords. But I am not your king	999
	Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd	999
	With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;	999
	And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,	999
	But with advice and silent secrecy.	999
	Do you as I do in these dangerous days:	999
	Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,	999
	At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,	999
	At Buckingham and all the crew of them,	999
	Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,	999
	That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:	999
	'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that	999
	Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.	999
	999
SALISBURY	My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.	999
	999
WARWICK	My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick	999
	Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.	999
	999
YORK	And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:	999
	Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick	999
	The greatest man in England but the king.	999

	999
KING HENRY VI	Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife:	999
	In sight of God and us, your guilt is great:	999
	Receive the sentence of the law for sins	999
	Such as by God's book are adjudged to death.	999
	You four, from hence to prison back again;	999
	From thence unto the place of execution:	999
	The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes,	999
	And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.	999
	You, madam, for you are more nobly born,	999
	Despoiled of your honour in your life,	999
	Shall, after three days' open penance done,	999
	Live in your country here in banishment,	999
	With Sir John Stanley, in the Isle of Man.	999
	999
DUCHESS	Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee:	999
	I cannot justify whom the law condemns.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DUCHESS and other prisoners, guarded]	999
	999
	Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.	999
	Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age	999
	Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!	999
	I beseech your majesty, give me leave to go;	999
	Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester: ere thou go,	999
	Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself	999
	Protector be; and God shall be my hope,	999
	My stay, my guide and lantern to my feet:	999
	And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved	999
	Than when thou wert protector to thy King.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	I see no reason why a king of years	999
	Should be to be protected like a child.	999
	God and King Henry govern England's realm.	999
	Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	My staff? here, noble Henry, is my staff:	999
	As willingly do I the same resign	999
	As e'er thy father Henry made it mine;	999
	And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it	999
	As others would ambitiously receive it.	999
	Farewell, good king: when I am dead and gone,	999
	May honourable peace attend thy throne!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Why, now is Henry king, and Margaret queen;	999
	And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,	999
	That bears so shrewd a maim; two pulls at once;	999
	His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off.	999
	This staff of honour raught, there let it stand	999
	Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;	999
	Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.	999

	This is the day appointed for the combat;	999
	And ready are the appellant and defendant,	999
	The armourer and his man, to enter the lists,	999
	So please your highness to behold the fight.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore	999
	Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	O God's name, see the lists and all things fit:	999
	Here let them end it; and God defend the right!	999
	999
YORK	I never saw a fellow worse bested,	999

First 'Prentice	Here, Peter, I drink to thee: and be not afraid.	999
	999
Second 'Prentice	Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master: fight	999

	999
PETER	I thank you all: drink, and pray for me, I pray	999
	you; for I think I have taken my last draught in	999
	this world. Here, Robin, an if I die, I give thee	999
	my apron: and, Will, thou shalt have my hammer:	999

	take my death, I never meant him any ill, nor the	999
	king, nor the queen: and therefore, Peter, have at	999
	thee with a downright blow!	999

GLOUCESTER	Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;	999

GLOUCESTER	Ten is the hour that was appointed me	999

	Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,	999

	Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook	999
	The abject people gazing on thy face,	999
	With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,	999
	That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels	999
	When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.	999
	But, soft! I think she comes; and I'll prepare	999
	My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.	999
	999
	[Enter the DUCHESS in a white sheet, and a taper	999

GLOUCESTER	No, stir not, for your lives; let her pass by.	999
	999
DUCHESS	Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?	999
	Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!	999
	See how the giddy multitude do point,	999
	And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!	999
	Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,	999
	And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,	999
	And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.	999
	999
DUCHESS	Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!	999
	For whilst I think I am thy married wife	999
	And thou a prince, protector of this land,	999
	Methinks I should not thus be led along,	999
	Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back,	999
	And followed with a rabble that rejoice	999
	To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.	999
	The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,	999
	And when I start, the envious people laugh	999
	And bid me be advised how I tread.	999
	Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?	999
	Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,	999
	Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?	999
	No; dark shall be my light and night my day;	999
	To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.	999
	Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife,	999
	And he a prince and ruler of the land:	999
	Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was	999
	As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,	999
	Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock	999
	To every idle rascal follower.	999
	But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,	999
	Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death	999
	Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;	999
	For Suffolk, he that can do all in all	999
	With her that hateth thee and hates us all,	999
	And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,	999
	Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,	999
	And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee:	999
	But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,	999
	Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry;	999
	I must offend before I be attainted;	999
	And had I twenty times so many foes,	999
	And each of them had twenty times their power,	999
	All these could not procure me any scathe,	999
	So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless.	999
	Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?	999
	Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away	999
	But I in danger for the breach of law.	999
	Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell:	999

	This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.	999
	999
	[Exit Herald]	999
	999
	My Nell, I take my leave: and, master sheriff,	999
	Let not her penance exceed the king's commission.	999
	999
Sheriff	An't please your grace, here my commission stays,	999
	And Sir John Stanley is appointed now	999
	To take her with him to the Isle of Man.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?	999
	999
STANLEY	So am I given in charge, may't please your grace.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Entreat her not the worse in that I pray	999
	You use her well: the world may laugh again;	999
	And I may live to do you kindness if	999
	You do it her: and so, Sir John, farewell!	999
	999
DUCHESS	What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.	999
	999
	[Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Servingmen]	999
	999
DUCHESS	Art thou gone too? all comfort go with thee!	999
	For none abides with me: my joy is death;	999
	Death, at whose name I oft have been afear'd,	999
	Because I wish'd this world's eternity.	999
	Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence;	999
	I care not whither, for I beg no favour,	999
	Only convey me where thou art commanded.	999
	999
STANLEY	Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man;	999
	There to be used according to your state.	999
	999
DUCHESS	That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:	999
	And shall I then be used reproachfully?	999
	999
STANLEY	Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey's lady;	999
	According to that state you shall be used.	999
	999
DUCHESS	Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,	999
	Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.	999
	999
Sheriff	It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.	999
	999
DUCHESS	Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharged.	999
	Come, Stanley, shall we go?	999
	999
STANLEY	Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,	999
	And go we to attire you for our journey.	999
	999
DUCHESS	My shame will not be shifted with my sheet:	999
	No, it will hang upon my richest robes	999
	And show itself, attire me how I can.	999
	Go, lead the way; I long to see my prison.	999

	999
	999
ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund's.	999
	999
	999
	[Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN	999
	MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, YORK, BUCKINGHAM,	999
	SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:	999
	'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,	999
	Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Can you not see? or will ye not observe	999
	The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?	999
	With what a majesty he bears himself,	999
	How insolent of late he is become,	999
	How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?	999
	We know the time since he was mild and affable,	999
	And if we did but glance a far-off look,	999
	Immediately he was upon his knee,	999
	That all the court admired him for submission:	999
	But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,	999
	When every one will give the time of day,	999
	He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,	999
	And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,	999
	Disdaining duty that to us belongs.	999
	Small curs are not regarded when they grin;	999
	But great men tremble when the lion roars;	999
	And Humphrey is no little man in England.	999
	First note that he is near you in descent,	999
	And should you fall, he as the next will mount.	999
	Me seemeth then it is no policy,	999
	Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears	999
	And his advantage following your decease,	999
	That he should come about your royal person	999
	Or be admitted to your highness' council.	999
	By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,	999
	And when he please to make commotion,	999
	'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.	999
	Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;	999
	Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden	999
	And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.	999
	The reverent care I bear unto my lord	999
	Made me collect these dangers in the duke.	999
	If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;	999
	Which fear if better reasons can supplant,	999
	I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.	999
	My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,	999
	Reprove my allegation, if you can;	999
	Or else conclude my words effectual.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Well hath your highness seen into this duke;	999
	And, had I first been put to speak my mind,	999
	I think I should have told your grace's tale.	999
	The duchess, by his subornation,	999
	Upon my life, began her devilish practises:	999
	Or, if he were not privy to those faults,	999
	Yet, by reputing of his high descent,	999
	As next the king he was successive heir,	999
	And such high vaunts of his nobility,	999
	Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess	999
	By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.	999
	Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;	999
	And in his simple show he harbours treason.	999
	The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.	999
	No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man	999
	Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.	999
	999
CARDINAL	Did he not, contrary to form of law,	999
	Devise strange deaths for small offences done?	999
	999
YORK	And did he not, in his protectorship,	999
	Levy great sums of money through the realm	999
	For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?	999
	By means whereof the towns each day revolted.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown.	999
	Which time will bring to light in smooth	999
	Duke Humphrey.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	My lords, at once: the care you have of us,	999
	To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,	999
	Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,	999
	Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent	999
	From meaning treason to our royal person	999
	As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:	999
	The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given	999
	To dream on evil or to work my downfall.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!	999
	Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,	999
	For he's disposed as the hateful raven:	999
	Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,	999
	For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.	999
	Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?	999
	Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all	999
	Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.	999
	999
	[Enter SOMERSET]	999
	999
SOMERSET	All health unto my gracious sovereign!	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?	999
	999
SOMERSET	That all your interest in those territories	999
	Is utterly bereft you; all is lost.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!	999
	999
YORK	[Aside]  Cold news for me; for I had hope of France	999
	As firmly as I hope for fertile England.	999
	Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud	999
	And caterpillars eat my leaves away;	999
	But I will remedy this gear ere long,	999
	Or sell my title for a glorious grave.	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	All happiness unto my lord the king!	999
	Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,	999
	Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:	999
	I do arrest thee of high treason here.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush	999
	Nor change my countenance for this arrest:	999
	A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.	999
	The purest spring is not so free from mud	999
	As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:	999
	Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?	999
	999
YORK	'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,	999
	And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay;	999
	By means whereof his highness hath lost France.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?	999
	I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,	999
	Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.	999
	So help me God, as I have watch'd the night,	999
	Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,	999
	That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,	999
	Or any groat I hoarded to my use,	999
	Be brought against me at my trial-day!	999
	No; many a pound of mine own proper store,	999
	Because I would not tax the needy commons,	999
	Have I disbursed to the garrisons,	999
	And never ask'd for restitution.	999
	999
CARDINAL	It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I say no more than truth, so help me God!	999
	999
YORK	In your protectorship you did devise	999
	Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,	999
	That England was defamed by tyranny.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was	999
	protector,	999
	Pity was all the fault that was in me;	999
	For I should melt at an offender's tears,	999
	And lowly words were ransom for their fault.	999
	Unless it were a bloody murderer,	999
	Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,	999
	I never gave them condign punishment:	999
	Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured	999
	Above the felon or what trespass else.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:	999
	But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,	999
	Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.	999
	I do arrest you in his highness' name;	999
	And here commit you to my lord cardinal	999
	To keep, until your further time of trial.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope	999
	That you will clear yourself from all suspect:	999
	My conscience tells me you are innocent.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:	999
	Virtue is choked with foul ambition	999
	And charity chased hence by rancour's hand;	999
	Foul subornation is predominant	999
	And equity exiled your highness' land.	999
	I know their complot is to have my life,	999
	And if my death might make this island happy,	999
	And prove the period of their tyranny,	999
	I would expend it with all willingness:	999
	But mine is made the prologue to their play;	999
	For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,	999
	Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.	999
	Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,	999
	And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;	999
	Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue	999
	The envious load that lies upon his heart;	999
	And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,	999
	Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,	999
	By false accuse doth level at my life:	999
	And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,	999
	Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,	999
	And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up	999
	My liefest liege to be mine enemy:	999
	Ay, all you have laid your heads together--	999
	Myself had notice of your conventicles--	999
	And all to make away my guiltless life.	999
	I shall not want false witness to condemn me,	999
	Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;	999
	The ancient proverb will be well effected:	999
	'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'	999
	999
CARDINAL	My liege, his railing is intolerable:	999
	If those that care to keep your royal person	999
	From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage	999
	Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at,	999
	And the offender granted scope of speech,	999
	'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here	999
	With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,	999
	As if she had suborned some to swear	999
	False allegations to o'erthrow his state?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	But I can give the loser leave to chide.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed;	999
	Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!	999
	And well such losers may have leave to speak.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:	999
	Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner.	999
	999
CARDINAL	Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch	999
	Before his legs be firm to bear his body.	999
	Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,	999
	And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.	999
	Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!	999
	For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.	999
	999
	[Exit, guarded]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,	999
	Do or undo, as if ourself were here.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	What, will your highness leave the parliament?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,	999
	Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,	999
	My body round engirt with misery,	999
	For what's more miserable than discontent?	999
	Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see	999
	The map of honour, truth and loyalty:	999
	And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come	999
	That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.	999
	What louring star now envies thy estate,	999
	That these great lords and Margaret our queen	999
	Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?	999
	Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;	999
	And as the butcher takes away the calf	999
	And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,	999
	Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,	999
	Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;	999
	And as the dam runs lowing up and down,	999
	Looking the way her harmless young one went,	999
	And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,	999
	Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case	999
	With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes	999
	Look after him and cannot do him good,	999
	So mighty are his vowed enemies.	999
	His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan	999
	Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL,	999
	SUFFOLK, and YORK; SOMERSET remains apart]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.	999
	Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,	999
	Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's show	999
	Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile	999
	With sorrow snares relenting passengers,	999
	Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,	999
	With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child	999
	That for the beauty thinks it excellent.	999
	Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I--	999
	And yet herein I judge mine own wit good--	999
	This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,	999
	To rid us of the fear we have of him.	999
	999
CARDINAL	That he should die is worthy policy;	999
	But yet we want a colour for his death:	999
	'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	But, in my mind, that were no policy:	999
	The king will labour still to save his life,	999
	The commons haply rise, to save his life;	999
	And yet we have but trivial argument,	999
	More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.	999
	999
YORK	So that, by this, you would not have him die.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!	999
	999
YORK	'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.	999
	But, my lord cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,	999
	Say as you think, and speak it from your souls,	999
	Were't not all one, an empty eagle were set	999
	To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,	999
	As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	So the poor chicken should be sure of death.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness, then,	999
	To make the fox surveyor of the fold?	999
	Who being accused a crafty murderer,	999
	His guilt should be but idly posted over,	999
	Because his purpose is not executed.	999
	No; let him die, in that he is a fox,	999
	By nature proved an enemy to the flock,	999
	Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,	999
	As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.	999
	And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:	999
	Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,	999
	Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,	999
	So he be dead; for that is good deceit	999
	Which mates him first that first intends deceit.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Not resolute, except so much were done;	999
	For things are often spoke and seldom meant:	999
	But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,	999
	Seeing the deed is meritorious,	999
	And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,	999
	Say but the word, and I will be his priest.	999
	999
CARDINAL	But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,	999
	Ere you can take due orders for a priest:	999
	Say you consent and censure well the deed,	999
	And I'll provide his executioner,	999
	I tender so the safety of my liege.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	And so say I.	999
	999
YORK	And I    and now we three have spoke it,	999
	It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.	999
	999
	[Enter a Post]	999
	999
Post	Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain,	999
	To signify that rebels there are up	999
	And put the Englishmen unto the sword:	999
	Send succors, lords, and stop the rage betime,	999
	Before the wound do grow uncurable;	999
	For, being green, there is great hope of help.	999
	999
CARDINAL	A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!	999
	What counsel give you in this weighty cause?	999
	999
YORK	That Somerset be sent as regent thither:	999
	'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd;	999
	Witness the fortune he hath had in France.	999
	999
SOMERSET	If York, with all his far-fet policy,	999
	Had been the regent there instead of me,	999
	He never would have stay'd in France so long.	999
	999
YORK	No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:	999
	I rather would have lost my life betimes	999
	Than bring a burthen of dishonour home	999
	By staying there so long till all were lost.	999
	Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:	999
	Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire,	999
	If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with:	999
	No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still:	999
	Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,	999
	Might happily have proved far worse than his.	999
	999
YORK	What, worse than nought? nay, then, a shame take all!	999
	999
SOMERSET	And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!	999
	999
CARDINAL	My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.	999
	The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms	999
	And temper clay with blood of Englishmen:	999
	To Ireland will you lead a band of men,	999
	Collected choicely, from each county some,	999
	And try your hap against the Irishmen?	999
	999
YORK	I will, my lord, so please his majesty.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Why, our authority is his consent,	999
	And what we do establish he confirms:	999
	Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.	999
	999
YORK	I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,	999
	Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd.	999
	But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.	999
	999
CARDINAL	No more of him; for I will deal with him	999
	That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.	999
	And so break off; the day is almost spent:	999
	Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.	999
	999
YORK	My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days	999
	At Bristol I expect my soldiers;	999
	For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but YORK]	999
	999
YORK	Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,	999
	And change misdoubt to resolution:	999
	Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art	999
	Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:	999
	Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,	999
	And find no harbour in a royal heart.	999
	Faster than spring-time showers comes thought	999
	on thought,	999
	And not a thought but thinks on dignity.	999
	My brain more busy than the labouring spider	999
	Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.	999
	Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,	999
	To send me packing with an host of men:	999
	I fear me you but warm the starved snake,	999
	Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting	999
	your hearts.	999
	'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:	999
	I take it kindly; and yet be well assured	999
	You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.	999
	Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,	999
	I will stir up in England some black storm	999
	Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;	999
	And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage	999
	Until the golden circuit on my head,	999
	Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,	999
	Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.	999
	And, for a minister of my intent,	999
	I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,	999
	John Cade of Ashford,	999
	To make commotion, as full well he can,	999
	Under the title of John Mortimer.	999
	In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade	999
	Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,	999
	And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts	999
	Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;	999
	And, in the end being rescued, I have seen	999
	Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,	999
	Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.	999
	Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,	999
	Hath he conversed with the enemy,	999
	And undiscover'd come to me again	999
	And given me notice of their villanies.	999
	This devil here shall be my substitute;	999
	For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,	999
	In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:	999
	By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,	999
	How they affect the house and claim of York.	999
	Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,	999
	I know no pain they can inflict upon him	999
	Will make him say I moved him to those arms.	999
	Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,	999
	Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength	999
	And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;	999
	For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,	999
	And Henry put apart, the next for me.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	Bury St. Edmund's. A room of state.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter certain Murderers, hastily]	999
	999
First Murderer	Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know	999
	We have dispatch'd the duke, as he commanded.	999
	999
Second Murderer	O that it were to do! What have we done?	999
	Didst ever hear a man so penitent?	999
	999
	[Enter SUFFOLK]	999
	999
First Murder	Here comes my lord.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?	999
	999
First Murderer	Ay, my good lord, he's dead.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house;	999
	I will reward you for this venturous deed.	999
	The king and all the peers are here at hand.	999
	Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,	999
	According as I gave directions?	999
	999
First Murderer	'Tis, my good lord.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Away! be gone.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Murderers]	999
	999
	[Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN	999
	MARGARET, CARDINAL, SOMERSET, with Attendants]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Go, call our uncle to our presence straight;	999
	Say we intend to try his grace to-day.	999
	If he be guilty, as 'tis published.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	I'll call him presently, my noble lord.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,	999
	Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester	999
	Than from true evidence of good esteem	999
	He be approved in practise culpable.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	God forbid any malice should prevail,	999
	That faultless may condemn a nobleman!	999
	Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	I thank thee, Meg; these words content me much.	999
	999
	[Re-enter SUFFOLK]	999
	999
	How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?	999
	Where is our uncle? what's the matter, Suffolk?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Marry, God forfend!	999
	999
CARDINAL	God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night	999
	The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.	999
	999
	[KING HENRY VI swoons]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	He doth revive again: madam, be patient.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	O heavenly God!	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	How fares my gracious lord?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry, comfort!	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?	999
	Came he right now to sing a raven's note,	999
	Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers;	999
	And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,	999
	By crying comfort from a hollow breast,	999
	Can chase away the first-conceived sound?	999
	Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words;	999
	Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say;	999
	Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.	999
	Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!	999
	Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny	999
	Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world.	999
	Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:	999
	Yet do not go away: come, basilisk,	999
	And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;	999
	For in the shade of death I shall find joy;	999
	In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?	999
	Although the duke was enemy to him,	999
	Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:	999
	And for myself, foe as he was to me,	999
	Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans	999
	Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,	999
	I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,	999
	Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,	999
	And all to have the noble duke alive.	999
	What know I how the world may deem of me?	999
	For it is known we were but hollow friends:	999
	It may be judged I made the duke away;	999
	So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,	999
	And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.	999
	This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy!	999
	To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.	999
	What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?	999
	I am no loathsome leper; look on me.	999
	What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?	999
	Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.	999
	Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?	999
	Why, then, dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.	999
	Erect his statue and worship it,	999
	And make my image but an alehouse sign.	999
	Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea	999
	And twice by awkward wind from England's bank	999
	Drove back again unto my native clime?	999
	What boded this, but well forewarning wind	999
	Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,	999
	Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?	999
	What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts	999
	And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:	999
	And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,	999
	Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock	999
	Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,	999
	But left that hateful office unto thee:	999
	The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,	999
	Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,	999
	With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:	999
	The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands	999
	And would not dash me with their ragged sides,	999
	Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,	999
	Might in thy palace perish Margaret.	999
	As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,	999
	When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,	999
	I stood upon the hatches in the storm,	999
	And when the dusky sky began to rob	999
	My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,	999
	I took a costly jewel from my neck,	999
	A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,	999
	And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,	999
	And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:	999
	And even with this I lost fair England's view	999
	And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart	999
	And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,	999
	For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.	999
	How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,	999
	The agent of thy foul inconstancy,	999
	To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did	999
	When he to madding Dido would unfold	999
	His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!	999
	Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?	999
	Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!	999
	For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.	999
	999
	[Noise within. Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY, and many Commons]	999
	999
WARWICK	It is reported, mighty sovereign,	999
	That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd	999
	By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.	999
	The commons, like an angry hive of bees	999
	That want their leader, scatter up and down	999
	And care not who they sting in his revenge.	999
	Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny,	999
	Until they hear the order of his death.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;	999
	But how he died God knows, not Henry:	999
	Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,	999
	And comment then upon his sudden death.	999
	999
WARWICK	That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,	999
	With the rude multitude till I return.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,	999
	My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul	999
	Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!	999
	If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,	999
	For judgment only doth belong to thee.	999
	Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips	999
	With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain	999
	Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,	999
	To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,	999
	And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:	999
	But all in vain are these mean obsequies;	999
	And to survey his dead and earthly image,	999
	What were it but to make my sorrow greater?	999
	999
	[Re-enter WARWICK and others, bearing	999
	GLOUCESTER'S body on a bed]	999
	999
WARWICK	Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	That is to see how deep my grave is made;	999
	For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,	999
	For seeing him I see my life in death.	999
	999
WARWICK	As surely as my soul intends to live	999
	With that dread King that took our state upon him	999
	To free us from his father's wrathful curse,	999
	I do believe that violent hands were laid	999
	Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!	999
	What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?	999
	999
WARWICK	See how the blood is settled in his face.	999
	Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,	999
	Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,	999
	Being all descended to the labouring heart;	999
	Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,	999
	Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy;	999
	Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth	999
	To blush and beautify the cheek again.	999
	But see, his face is black and full of blood,	999
	His eye-balls further out than when he lived,	999
	Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;	999
	His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling;	999
	His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd	999
	And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:	999
	Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking;	999
	His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,	999
	Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.	999
	It cannot be but he was murder'd here;	999
	The least of all these signs were probable.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?	999
	Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;	999
	And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.	999
	999
WARWICK	But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,	999
	And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep:	999
	'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;	999
	And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen	999
	As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.	999
	999
WARWICK	Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh	999
	And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,	999
	But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?	999
	Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,	999
	But may imagine how the bird was dead,	999
	Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?	999
	Even so suspicious is this tragedy.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?	999
	Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;	999
	But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,	999
	That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart	999
	That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.	999
	Say, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire,	999
	That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.	999
	999
	[Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others]	999
	999
WARWICK	What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	He dares not calm his contumelious spirit	999
	Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,	999
	Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.	999
	999
WARWICK	Madam, be still; with reverence may I say;	999
	For every word you speak in his behalf	999
	Is slander to your royal dignity.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!	999
	If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,	999
	Thy mother took into her blameful bed	999
	Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock	999
	Was graft with crab-tree slip; whose fruit thou art,	999
	And never of the Nevils' noble race.	999
	999
WARWICK	But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee	999
	And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,	999
	Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,	999
	And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,	999
	I would, false murderous coward, on thy knee	999
	Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,	999
	And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st	999
	That thou thyself was born in bastardy;	999
	And after all this fearful homage done,	999
	Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,	999
	Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,	999
	If from this presence thou darest go with me.	999
	999
WARWICK	Away even now, or I will drag thee hence:	999
	Unworthy though thou art, I'll cope with thee	999
	And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.	999
	999
	[Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!	999
	Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,	999
	And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel	999
	Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.	999
	999
	[A noise within]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	What noise is this?	999
	999
	[Re-enter SUFFOLK and WARWICK, with their	999
	weapons drawn]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Why, how now, lords! your wrathful weapons drawn	999
	Here in our presence! dare you be so bold?	999
	Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury	999
	Set all upon me, mighty sovereign.	999
	999
SALISBURY	[To the Commons, entering]  Sirs, stand apart;	999
	the king shall know your mind.	999
	Dread lord, the commons send you word by me,	999
	Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,	999
	Or banished fair England's territories,	999
	They will by violence tear him from your palace	999
	And torture him with grievous lingering death.	999
	They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;	999
	They say, in him they fear your highness' death;	999
	And mere instinct of love and loyalty,	999
	Free from a stubborn opposite intent,	999
	As being thought to contradict your liking,	999
	Makes them thus forward in his banishment.	999
	They say, in care of your most royal person,	999
	That if your highness should intend to sleep	999
	And charge that no man should disturb your rest	999
	In pain of your dislike or pain of death,	999
	Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,	999
	Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,	999
	That slily glided towards your majesty,	999
	It were but necessary you were waked,	999
	Lest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,	999
	The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal;	999
	And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,	999
	That they will guard you, whether you will or no,	999
	From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,	999
	With whose envenomed and fatal sting,	999
	Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,	999
	They say, is shamefully bereft of life.	999
	999
Commons	[Within]  An answer from the king, my	999
	Lord of Salisbury!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	'Tis like the commons, rude unpolish'd hinds,	999
	Could send such message to their sovereign:	999
	But you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd,	999
	To show how quaint an orator you are:	999
	But all the honour Salisbury hath won	999
	Is, that he was the lord ambassador	999
	Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king.	999
	999
Commons	[Within]  An answer from the king, or we will all break in!	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me.	999
	I thank them for their tender loving care;	999
	And had I not been cited so by them,	999
	Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;	999
	For, sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy	999
	Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means:	999
	And therefore, by His majesty I swear,	999
	Whose far unworthy deputy I am,	999
	He shall not breathe infection in this air	999
	But three days longer, on the pain of death.	999
	999
	[Exit SALISBURY]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!	999
	No more, I say: if thou dost plead for him,	999
	Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.	999
	Had I but said, I would have kept my word,	999
	But when I swear, it is irrevocable.	999
	If, after three days' space, thou here be'st found	999
	On any ground that I am ruler of,	999
	The world shall not be ransom for thy life.	999
	Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;	999
	I have great matters to impart to thee.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Mischance and sorrow go along with you!	999
	Heart's discontent and sour affliction	999
	Be playfellows to keep you company!	999
	There's two of you; the devil make a third!	999
	And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,	999
	And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!	999
	Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?	999
	Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,	999
	I would invent as bitter-searching terms,	999
	As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,	999
	Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,	999
	With full as many signs of deadly hate,	999
	As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:	999
	My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;	999
	Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;	999
	Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;	999
	Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:	999
	And even now my burthen'd heart would break,	999
	Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!	999
	Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!	999
	Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!	999
	Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!	999
	Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!	999
	Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,	999
	And boding screech-owls make the concert full!	999
	All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Enough, sweet Suffolk; thou torment'st thyself;	999
	And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,	999
	Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,	999
	And turn the force of them upon thyself.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?	999
	Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,	999
	Well could I curse away a winter's night,	999
	Though standing naked on a mountain top,	999
	Where biting cold would never let grass grow,	999
	And think it but a minute spent in sport.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,	999
	That I may dew it with my mournful tears;	999
	Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,	999
	To wash away my woful monuments.	999
	O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,	999
	That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,	999
	Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!	999
	So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;	999
	'Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,	999
	As one that surfeits thinking on a want.	999
	I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,	999
	Adventure to be banished myself:	999
	And banished I am, if but from thee.	999
	Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.	999
	O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn'd	999
	Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,	999
	Loather a hundred times to part than die.	999
	Yet now farewell; and farewell life with thee!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished;	999
	Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.	999
	'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;	999
	A wilderness is populous enough,	999
	So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:	999
	For where thou art, there is the world itself,	999
	With every several pleasure in the world,	999
	And where thou art not, desolation.	999
	I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;	999
	Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest.	999
	999
	[Enter VAUX]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Wither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I prithee?	999
	999
VAUX	To signify unto his majesty	999
	That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;	999
	For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,	999
	That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,	999
	Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.	999
	Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost	999
	Were by his side; sometime he calls the king,	999
	And whispers to his pillow, as to him,	999
	The secrets of his overcharged soul;	999
	And I am sent to tell his majesty	999
	That even now he cries aloud for him.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Go tell this heavy message to the king.	999
	999
	[Exit VAUX]	999
	999
	Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!	999
	But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,	999
	Omitting Suffolk's exile, my soul's treasure?	999
	Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,	999
	And with the southern clouds contend in tears,	999
	Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?	999
	Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming;	999
	If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	If I depart from thee, I cannot live;	999
	And in thy sight to die, what were it else	999
	But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?	999
	Here could I breathe my soul into the air,	999
	As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe	999
	Dying with mother's dug between its lips:	999
	Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,	999
	And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,	999
	To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;	999
	So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,	999
	Or I should breathe it so into thy body,	999
	And then it lived in sweet Elysium.	999
	To die by thee were but to die in jest;	999
	From thee to die were torture more than death:	999
	O, let me stay, befall what may befall!	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive,	999
	It is applied to a deathful wound.	999
	To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee;	999
	For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,	999
	I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	I go.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	And take my heart with thee.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask	999
	That ever did contain a thing of worth.	999
	Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we	999
	This way fall I to death.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	This way for me.	999

	999
	[Enter the KING, SALISBURY, WARWICK, to the	999
	CARDINAL in bed]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	How fares my lord? speak, Beaufort, to	999
	thy sovereign.	999
	999
CARDINAL	If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure,	999
	Enough to purchase such another island,	999
	So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,	999
	Where death's approach is seen so terrible!	999
	999
WARWICK	Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.	999
	999
CARDINAL	Bring me unto my trial when you will.	999
	Died he not in his bed? where should he die?	999
	Can I make men live, whether they will or no?	999
	O, torture me no more! I will confess.	999
	Alive again? then show me where he is:	999
	I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.	999
	He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.	999
	Comb down his hair; look, look! it stands upright,	999
	Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.	999
	Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary	999
	Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	O thou eternal Mover of the heavens.	999
	Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!	999
	O, beat away the busy meddling fiend	999
	That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul.	999
	And from his bosom purge this black despair!	999
	999
WARWICK	See, how the pangs of death do make him grin!	999
	999
SALISBURY	Disturb him not; let him pass peaceably.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!	999
	Lord cardinal, if thou think'st on heaven's bliss,	999
	Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.	999
	He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!	999
	999
WARWICK	So bad a death argues a monstrous life.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.	999
	Close up his eyes and draw the curtain close;	999
	And let us all to meditation.	999

ACT IV	999

	999
	999
SCENE I	The coast of Kent.	999
	999
	999
	[Alarum. Fight at sea. Ordnance goes off. Enter a	999
	Captain, a Master, a Master's-mate, WALTER WHITMORE,	999
	and others; with them SUFFOLK, and others, prisoners]	999
	999
Captain	The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day	999
	Is crept into the bosom of the sea;	999
	And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades	999
	That drag the tragic melancholy night;	999
	Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,	999
	Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws	999
	Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.	999
	Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;	999
	For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,	999
	Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,	999
	Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.	999
	Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;	999
	And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;	999
	The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.	999
	999
First Gentleman	What is my ransom, master? let me know.	999
	999
Master	A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.	999
	999
Master's-Mate	And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.	999
	999
Captain	What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,	999
	And bear the name and port of gentlemen?	999
	Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:	999
	The lives of those which we have lost in fight	999
	Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!	999
	999
First Gentleman	I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	And so will I and write home for it straight.	999
	999
WHITMORE	I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,	999
	And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die;	999
	999
	[To SUFFOLK]	999
	999
	And so should these, if I might have my will.	999
	999
Captain	Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Look on my George; I am a gentleman:	999
	Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.	999
	999
WHITMORE	And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.	999
	How now! why start'st thou? what, doth	999
	death affright?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.	999
	A cunning man did calculate my birth	999
	And told me that by water I should die:	999
	Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;	999
	Thy name is Gaultier, being rightly sounded.	999
	999
WHITMORE	Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not:	999
	Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,	999
	But with our sword we wiped away the blot;	999
	Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,	999
	Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,	999
	And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,	999
	The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.	999
	999
WHITMORE	The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:	999
	Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?	999
	999
Captain	But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,	999
	The honourable blood of Lancaster,	999
	Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.	999
	Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?	999
	Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule	999
	And thought thee happy when I shook my head?	999
	How often hast thou waited at my cup,	999
	Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.	999
	When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?	999
	Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,	999
	Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride;	999
	How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood	999
	And duly waited for my coming forth?	999
	This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,	999
	And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.	999
	999
WHITMORE	Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?	999
	999
Captain	First let my words stab him, as he hath me.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.	999
	999
Captain	Convey him hence and on our longboat's side	999
	Strike off his head.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Thou darest not, for thy own.	999
	999
Captain	Yes, Pole.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	       Pole!	999
	999
Captain	         Pool! Sir Pool! lord!	999
	Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt	999
	Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.	999
	Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth	999
	For swallowing the treasure of the realm:	999
	Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;	999
	And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,	999
	Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,	999
	Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:	999
	And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,	999
	For daring to affy a mighty lord	999
	Unto the daughter of a worthless king,	999
	Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.	999
	By devilish policy art thou grown great,	999
	And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged	999
	With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.	999
	By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,	999
	The false revolting Normans thorough thee	999
	Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy	999
	Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,	999
	And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.	999
	The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,	999
	Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,	999
	As hating thee, are rising up in arms:	999
	And now the house of York, thrust from the crown	999
	By shameful murder of a guiltless king	999
	And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,	999
	Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours	999
	Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,	999
	Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.'	999
	The commons here in Kent are up in arms:	999
	And, to conclude, reproach and beggary	999
	Is crept into the palace of our king.	999
	And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder	999
	Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!	999
	Small things make base men proud: this villain here,	999
	Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more	999
	Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.	999
	Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:	999
	It is impossible that I should die	999
	By such a lowly vassal as thyself.	999
	Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:	999
	I go of message from the queen to France;	999
	I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.	999
	999
Captain	Walter,--	999
	999
WHITMORE	Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.	999
	999
WHITMORE	Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.	999
	What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?	999
	999
First Gentleman	My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,	999
	Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.	999
	Far be it we should honour such as these	999
	With humble suit: no, rather let my head	999
	Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any	999
	Save to the God of heaven and to my king;	999
	And sooner dance upon a bloody pole	999
	Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.	999
	True nobility is exempt from fear:	999
	More can I bear than you dare execute.	999
	999
Captain	Hale him away, and let him talk no more.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,	999
	That this my death may never be forgot!	999
	Great men oft die by vile bezonians:	999
	A Roman sworder and banditto slave	999
	Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand	999
	Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders	999
	Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk]	999
	999
Captain	And as for these whose ransom we have set,	999
	It is our pleasure one of them depart;	999
	Therefore come you with us and let him go.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but the First Gentleman]	999
	999
	[Re-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's body]	999
	999
WHITMORE	There let his head and lifeless body lie,	999
	Until the queen his mistress bury it.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
First Gentleman	O barbarous and bloody spectacle!	999
	His body will I bear unto the king:	999
	If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;	999
	So will the queen, that living held him dear.	999

	999
BEVIS	Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath;	999
	they have been up these two days.	999
	999
HOLLAND	They have the more need to sleep now, then.	999
	999
BEVIS	I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress	999
	the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.	999
	999
HOLLAND	So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it	999
	was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.	999
	999
BEVIS	O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.	999
	999
HOLLAND	The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.	999
	999
BEVIS	Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen.	999
	999
HOLLAND	True; and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation;	999
	which is as much to say as, let the magistrates be	999
	labouring men; and therefore should we be	999
	magistrates.	999
	999
BEVIS	Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a	999
	brave mind than a hard hand.	999
	999
HOLLAND	I see them! I see them! there's Best's son, the	999
	tanner of Wingham,--	999
	999
BEVIS	He shall have the skin of our enemies, to make	999
	dog's-leather of.	999
	999
HOLLAND	And Dick the Butcher,--	999
	999
BEVIS	Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity's	999
	throat cut like a calf.	999
	999
HOLLAND	And Smith the weaver,--	999
	999
BEVIS	Argo, their thread of life is spun.	999
	999
HOLLAND	Come, come, let's fall in with them.	999
	999
	[Drum. Enter CADE, DICK the Butcher, SMITH the	999
	Weaver, and a Sawyer, with infinite numbers]	999
	999
CADE	We John Cade, so termed of our supposed father,--	999
	999
DICK	[Aside]  Or rather, of stealing a cade of herrings.	999
	999
CADE	For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired with	999
	the spirit of putting down kings and princes,	999
	--Command silence.	999
	999
DICK	Silence!	999
	999
CADE	My father was a Mortimer,--	999
	999
DICK	[Aside]  He was an honest man, and a good	999
	bricklayer.	999
	999
CADE	My mother a Plantagenet,--	999
	999
DICK	[Aside]  I knew her well; she was a midwife.	999
	999
CADE	My wife descended of the Lacies,--	999
	999
DICK	[Aside]  She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter, and	999
	sold many laces.	999
	999
SMITH	[Aside]  But now of late, notable to travel with her	999
	furred pack, she washes bucks here at home.	999
	999
CADE	Therefore am I of an honourable house.	999
	999
DICK	[Aside]  Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable;	999
	and there was he borne, under a hedge, for his	999
	father had never a house but the cage.	999
	999
CADE	Valiant I am.	999
	999
SMITH	[Aside]  A' must needs; for beggary is valiant.	999
	999
CADE	I am able to endure much.	999
	999
DICK	[Aside]  No question of that; for I have seen him	999
	whipped three market-days together.	999
	999
CADE	I fear neither sword nor fire.	999
	999
SMITH	[Aside]  He need not fear the sword; for his coat is of proof.	999
	999
DICK	[Aside]  But methinks he should stand in fear of	999
	fire, being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep.	999
	999
CADE	Be brave, then; for your captain is brave, and vows	999
	reformation. There shall be in England seven	999
	halfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the three-hooped	999
	pot; shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony	999
	to drink small beer: all the realm shall be in	999
	common; and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to	999
	grass: and when I am king, as king I will be,--	999
	999
ALL	God save your majesty!	999
	999
CADE	I thank you, good people: there shall be no money;	999
	all shall eat and drink on my score; and I will	999
	apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree	999
	like brothers and worship me their lord.	999
	999
DICK	The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.	999
	999
CADE	Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable	999
	thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should	999
	be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled	999
	o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:	999
	but I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal	999
	once to a thing, and I was never mine own man	999
	since. How now! who's there?	999
	999
	[Enter some, bringing forward the Clerk of Chatham]	999
	999
SMITH	The clerk of Chatham: he can write and read and	999
	cast accompt.	999
	999
CADE	O monstrous!	999
	999
SMITH	We took him setting of boys' copies.	999
	999
CADE	Here's a villain!	999
	999
SMITH	Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.	999
	999
CADE	Nay, then, he is a conjurer.	999
	999
DICK	Nay, he can make obligations, and write court-hand.	999
	999
CADE	I am sorry for't: the man is a proper man, of mine	999
	honour; unless I find him guilty, he shall not die.	999
	Come hither, sirrah, I must examine thee: what is thy name?	999
	999
Clerk	Emmanuel.	999
	999
DICK	They use to write it on the top of letters: 'twill	999
	go hard with you.	999
	999
CADE	Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name? or	999
	hast thou a mark to thyself, like an honest	999
	plain-dealing man?	999
	999
CLERK	Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought up	999
	that I can write my name.	999
	999
ALL	He hath confessed: away with him! he's a villain	999
	and a traitor.	999
	999
CADE	Away with him, I say! hang him with his pen and	999
	ink-horn about his neck.	999

MICHAEL	Where's our general?	999
	999
CADE	Here I am, thou particular fellow.	999
	999
MICHAEL	Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and his	999
	brother are hard by, with the king's forces.	999
	999
CADE	Stand, villain, stand, or I'll fell thee down. He	999
	shall be encountered with a man as good as himself:	999
	he is but a knight, is a'?	999
	999
MICHAEL	No.	999
	999
CADE	To equal him, I will make myself a knight presently.	999

	999
	[Enter SIR HUMPHREY and WILLIAM STAFFORD, with	999
	drum and soldiers]	999
	999
SIR HUMPHREY	Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,	999
	Mark'd for the gallows, lay your weapons down;	999
	Home to your cottages, forsake this groom:	999
	The king is merciful, if you revolt.	999
	999
WILLIAM STAFFORD	But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood,	999
	If you go forward; therefore yield, or die.	999
	999
CADE	As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not:	999
	It is to you, good people, that I speak,	999
	Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign;	999
	For I am rightful heir unto the crown.	999
	999
SIR HUMPHREY	Villain, thy father was a plasterer;	999
	And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?	999
	999
CADE	And Adam was a gardener.	999
	999
WILLIAM STAFFORD	And what of that?	999
	999
CADE	Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March.	999
	Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter, did he not?	999
	999
SIR HUMPHREY	Ay, sir.	999
	999
CADE	By her he had two children at one birth.	999
	999
WILLIAM STAFFORD	That's false.	999
	999
CADE	Ay, there's the question; but I say, 'tis true:	999
	The elder of them, being put to nurse,	999
	Was by a beggar-woman stolen away;	999
	And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,	999
	Became a bricklayer when he came to age:	999
	His son am I; deny it, if you can.	999
	999
DICK	Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.	999
	999
SMITH	Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and	999
	the bricks are alive at this day to testify it;	999
	therefore deny it not.	999
	999
SIR HUMPHREY	And will you credit this base drudge's words,	999
	That speaks he knows not what?	999
	999
ALL	Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.	999
	999
WILLIAM STAFFORD	Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.	999
	999
CADE	[Aside]  He lies, for I invented it myself.	999
	Go to, sirrah, tell the king from me, that, for his	999
	father's sake, Henry the Fifth, in whose time boys	999
	went to span-counter for French crowns, I am content	999
	he shall reign; but I'll be protector over him.	999
	999
DICK	And furthermore, well have the Lord Say's head for	999
	selling the dukedom of Maine.	999
	999
CADE	And good reason; for thereby is England mained, and	999
	fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds	999
	it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say	999
	hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch:	999
	and more than that, he can speak French; and	999
	therefore he is a traitor.	999
	999
SIR HUMPHREY	O gross and miserable ignorance!	999
	999
CADE	Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are our	999
	enemies; go to, then, I ask but this: can he that	999
	speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good	999
	counsellor, or no?	999
	999
ALL	No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.	999
	999
WILLIAM STAFFORD	Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,	999
	Assail them with the army of the king.	999
	999
SIR HUMPHREY	Herald, away; and throughout every town	999
	Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;	999
	That those which fly before the battle ends	999
	May, even in their wives' and children's sight,	999
	Be hang'd up for example at their doors:	999
	And you that be the king's friends, follow me.	999
	999
	[Exeunt WILLIAM STAFFORD and SIR HUMPHREY, and soldiers]	999
	999
CADE	And you that love the commons, follow me.	999
	Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.	999
	We will not leave one lord, one gentleman:	999
	Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon;	999
	For they are thrifty honest men, and such	999
	As would, but that they dare not, take our parts.	999
	999
DICK	They are all in order and march toward us.	999
	999
CADE	But then are we in order when we are most	999

	999
DICK	Here, sir.	999
	999
CADE	They fell before thee like sheep and oxen, and thou	999
	behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own	999
	slaughter-house: therefore thus will I reward thee,	999
	the Lent shall be as long again as it is; and thou	999
	shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking	999

	999
DICK	I desire no more.	999
	999
CADE	And, to speak truth, thou deservest no less. This	999

	[Putting on SIR HUMPHREY'S brigandine]	999

	Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.	999
	But who can cease to weep and look on this?	999
	Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast:	999
	But where's the body that I should embrace?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	What answer makes your grace to the rebels'	999
	supplication?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	I'll send some holy bishop to entreat;	999
	For God forbid so many simple souls	999
	Should perish by the sword! And I myself,	999
	Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,	999
	Will parley with Jack Cade their general:	999
	But stay, I'll read it over once again.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Ah, barbarous villains! hath this lovely face	999
	Ruled, like a wandering planet, over me,	999
	And could it not enforce them to relent,	999
	That were unworthy to behold the same?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.	999
	999
SAY	Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	How now, madam!	999
	Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death?	999
	I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,	999
	Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	How now! what news? why comest thou in such haste?	999
	999
Messenger	The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord!	999
	Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,	999
	Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house,	999
	And calls your grace usurper openly	999
	And vows to crown himself in Westminster.	999
	His army is a ragged multitude	999
	Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless:	999
	Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother's death	999
	Hath given them heart and courage to proceed:	999
	All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,	999
	They call false caterpillars, and intend their death.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	O graceless men! they know not what they do.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	My gracious lord, return to Killingworth,	999
	Until a power be raised to put them down.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,	999
	These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Lord Say, the traitors hate thee;	999
	Therefore away with us to Killingworth.	999
	999
SAY	So might your grace's person be in danger.	999
	The sight of me is odious in their eyes;	999
	And therefore in this city will I stay	999
	And live alone as secret as I may.	999
	999
	[Enter another Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	Jack Cade hath gotten London bridge:	999
	The citizens fly and forsake their houses:	999

	To spoil the city and your royal court.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Then linger not, my lord, away, take horse.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Come, Margaret; God, our hope, will succor us.	999

SCALES	How now! is Jack Cade slain?	999
	999
First Citizen	No, my lord, nor likely to be slain; for they have	999

	them: the lord mayor craves aid of your honour from	999
	the Tower, to defend the city from the rebels.	999

	pound, the last subsidy.	999
	999
	[Enter BEVIS, with Lord SAY]	999
	999
CADE	Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times. Ah,	999
	thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord! now	999
	art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction	999
	regal. What canst thou answer to my majesty for	999
	giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu, the	999
	dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these	999
	presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I	999
	am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such	999
	filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously	999
	corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a	999
	grammar school; and whereas, before, our forefathers	999
	had no other books but the score and the tally, thou	999
	hast caused printing to be used, and, contrary to	999
	the king, his crown and dignity, thou hast built a	999
	paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou	999
	hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and	999
	a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian	999
	ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed	999
	justices of peace, to call poor men before them	999
	about matters they were not able to answer.	999
	Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because	999
	they could not read, thou hast hanged them; when,	999
	indeed, only for that cause they have been most	999
	worthy to live. Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth, dost thou not?	999
	999
SAY	What of that?	999
	999
CADE	Marry, thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a	999
	cloak, when honester men than thou go in their hose	999
	and doublets.	999

CADE	Away with him, away with him! he speaks Latin.	999
	999
SAY	Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.	999
	Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,	999
	Is term'd the civil'st place of this isle:	999
	Sweet is the country, because full of riches;	999
	The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;	999
	Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.	999
	I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy,	999
	Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.	999
	Justice with favour have I always done;	999
	Prayers and tears have moved me, gifts could never.	999
	When have I aught exacted at your hands,	999
	But to maintain the king, the realm and you?	999
	Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks,	999
	Because my book preferr'd me to the king,	999
	And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,	999
	Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,	999
	Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits,	999
	You cannot but forbear to murder me:	999
	This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings	999
	For your behoof,--	999
	999
CADE	Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?	999

SAY	Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck	999
	Those that I never saw and struck them dead.	999
	999
BEVIS	O monstrous coward! what, to come behind folks?	999
	999
SAY	These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.	999
	999
CADE	Give him a box o' the ear and that will make 'em red again.	999
	999
SAY	Long sitting to determine poor men's causes	999
	Hath made me full of sickness and diseases.	999

	999
SAY	The palsy, and not fear, provokes me.	999
	999
CADE	Nay, he nods at us, as who should say, I'll be even	999
	with you: I'll see if his head will stand steadier	999
	on a pole, or no. Take him away, and behead him.	999
	999
SAY	Tell me wherein have I offended most?	999
	Have I affected wealth or honour? speak.	999
	Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?	999
	Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?	999
	Whom have I injured, that ye seek my death?	999
	These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding,	999
	This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.	999
	O, let me live!	999
	999
CADE	[Aside]  I feel remorse in myself with his words;	999
	but I'll bridle it: he shall die, an it be but for	999
	pleading so well for his life. Away with him! he	999
	has a familiar under his tongue; he speaks not o'	999
	God's name. Go, take him away, I say, and strike	999
	off his head presently; and then break into his	999
	son-in-law's house, Sir James Cromer, and strike off	999
	his head, and bring them both upon two poles hither.	999
	999
ALL	It shall be done.	999
	999
SAY	Ah, countrymen! if when you make your prayers,	999
	God should be so obdurate as yourselves,	999
	How would it fare with your departed souls?	999
	And therefore yet relent, and save my life.	999
	999
CADE	Away with him! and do as I command ye.	999
	999
	[Exeunt some with Lord SAY]	999
	999
	The proudest peer in the realm shall not wear a head	999

	me in capite; and we charge and command that their	999

	999
	[Re-enter one with the heads]	999

CADE	But is not this braver? Let them kiss one another,	999
	for they loved well when they were alive. Now part	999
	them again, lest they consult about the giving up of	999
	some more towns in France. Soldiers, defer the	999
	spoil of the city until night: for with these borne	999

	That will forsake thee and go home in peace.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	What say ye, countrymen? will ye relent,	999
	And yield to mercy whilst 'tis offer'd you;	999
	Or let a rebel lead you to your deaths?	999
	Who loves the king and will embrace his pardon,	999
	Fling up his cap, and say 'God save his majesty!'	999
	Who hateth him and honours not his father,	999
	Henry the Fifth, that made all France to quake,	999
	Shake he his weapon at us and pass by.	999
	999
ALL	God save the king! God save the king!	999
	999
CADE	What, Buckingham and Clifford, are ye so brave? And	999
	you, base peasants, do ye believe him? will you	999
	needs be hanged with your pardons about your necks?	999
	Hath my sword therefore broke through London gates,	999
	that you should leave me at the White Hart in	999
	Southwark? I thought ye would never have given out	999
	these arms till you had recovered your ancient	999
	freedom: but you are all recreants and dastards,	999
	and delight to live in slavery to the nobility. Let	999
	them break your backs with burthens, take your	999
	houses over your heads, ravish your wives and	999
	daughters before your faces: for me, I will make	999
	shift for one; and so, God's curse light upon you	999
	all!	999
	999
ALL	We'll follow Cade, we'll follow Cade!	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Is Cade the son of Henry the Fifth,	999
	That thus you do exclaim you'll go with him?	999
	Will he conduct you through the heart of France,	999
	And make the meanest of you earls and dukes?	999
	Alas, he hath no home, no place to fly to;	999
	Nor knows he how to live but by the spoil,	999
	Unless by robbing of your friends and us.	999
	Were't not a shame, that whilst you live at jar,	999
	The fearful French, whom you late vanquished,	999
	Should make a start o'er seas and vanquish you?	999
	Methinks already in this civil broil	999
	I see them lording it in London streets,	999
	Crying 'Villiago!' unto all they meet.	999
	Better ten thousand base-born Cades miscarry	999
	Than you should stoop unto a Frenchman's mercy.	999
	To France, to France, and get what you have lost;	999
	Spare England, for it is your native coast;	999
	Henry hath money, you are strong and manly;	999
	God on our side, doubt not of victory.	999
	999
ALL	A Clifford! a Clifford! we'll follow the king and Clifford.	999
	999
CADE	Was ever feather so lightly blown to and fro as this	999
	multitude? The name of Henry the Fifth hales them	999
	to an hundred mischiefs, and makes them leave me	999
	desolate. I see them lay their heads together to	999
	surprise me. My sword make way for me, for here is	999
	no staying. In despite of the devils and hell, have	999
	through the very middest of you? and heavens and	999
	honour be witness, that no want of resolution in me.	999
	but only my followers' base and ignominious	999
	treasons, makes me betake me to my heels.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	What, is he fled? Go some, and follow him;	999
	And he that brings his head unto the king	999
	Shall have a thousand crowns for his reward.	999
	999
	[Exeunt some of them]	999
	999

	999
	[Sound Trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN	999
	MARGARET, and SOMERSET, on the terrace]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Was ever king that joy'd an earthly throne,	999
	And could command no more content than I?	999
	No sooner was I crept out of my cradle	999
	But I was made a king, at nine months old.	999
	Was never subject long'd to be a king	999
	As I do long and wish to be a subject.	999
	999
	[Enter BUCKINGHAM and CLIFFORD]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Health and glad tidings to your majesty!	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Why, Buckingham, is the traitor Cade surprised?	999
	Or is he but retired to make him strong?	999
	999
	[Enter below, multitudes, with halters about	999
	their necks]	999
	999
CLIFFORD	He is fled, my lord, and all his powers do yield;	999
	And humbly thus, with halters on their necks,	999
	Expect your highness' doom of life or death.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Then, heaven, set ope thy everlasting gates,	999
	To entertain my vows of thanks and praise!	999
	Soldiers, this day have you redeemed your lives,	999
	And show'd how well you love your prince and country:	999
	Continue still in this so good a mind,	999
	And Henry, though he be infortunate,	999
	Assure yourselves, will never be unkind:	999
	And so, with thanks and pardon to you all,	999
	I do dismiss you to your several countries.	999

	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	Please it your grace to be advertised	999
	The Duke of York is newly come from Ireland,	999
	And with a puissant and a mighty power	999
	Of gallowglasses and stout kerns	999
	Is marching hitherward in proud array,	999
	And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,	999
	His arms are only to remove from thee	999
	The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms traitor.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd.	999
	Like to a ship that, having 'scaped a tempest,	999
	Is straightway calm'd and boarded with a pirate:	999
	But now is Cade driven back, his men dispersed;	999
	And now is York in arms to second him.	999
	I pray thee, Buckingham, go and meet him,	999
	And ask him what's the reason of these arms.	999
	Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;	999
	And, Somerset, we'll commit thee thither,	999
	Until his army be dismiss'd from him.	999
	999
SOMERSET	My lord,	999
	I'll yield myself to prison willingly,	999
	Or unto death, to do my country good.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	In any case, be not too rough in terms;	999
	For he is fierce and cannot brook hard language.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	I will, my lord; and doubt not so to deal	999
	As all things shall redound unto your good.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Come, wife, let's in, and learn to govern better;	999
	For yet may England curse my wretched reign.	999

SCENE X	Kent. IDEN's garden.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CADE]	999
	999
CADE	Fie on ambition! fie on myself, that have a sword,	999
	and yet am ready to famish! These five days have I	999
	hid me in these woods and durst not peep out, for	999
	all the country is laid for me; but now am I so	999
	hungry that if I might have a lease of my life for a	999
	thousand years I could stay no longer. Wherefore,	999
	on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to	999
	see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another	999
	while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach	999
	this hot weather. And I think this word 'sallet'	999
	was born to do me good: for many a time, but for a	999
	sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown	999
	bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and	999
	bravely marching, it hath served me instead of a	999
	quart pot to drink in; and now the word 'sallet'	999
	must serve me to feed on.	999
	999
	[Enter IDEN]	999
	999
IDEN	Lord, who would live turmoiled in the court,	999
	And may enjoy such quiet walks as these?	999
	This small inheritance my father left me	999
	Contenteth me, and worth a monarchy.	999
	I seek not to wax great by others' waning,	999
	Or gather wealth, I care not, with what envy:	999
	Sufficeth that I have maintains my state	999
	And sends the poor well pleased from my gate.	999
	999
CADE	Here's the lord of the soil come to seize me for a	999
	stray, for entering his fee-simple without leave.	999
	Ah, villain, thou wilt betray me, and get a thousand	999
	crowns of the king carrying my head to him: but	999
	I'll make thee eat iron like an ostrich, and swallow	999
	my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.	999
	999
IDEN	Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,	999
	I know thee not; why, then, should I betray thee?	999
	Is't not enough to break into my garden,	999
	And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,	999
	Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,	999
	But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?	999
	999
CADE	Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was	999
	broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I	999
	have eat no meat these five days; yet, come thou and	999
	thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead	999
	as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.	999
	999
IDEN	Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,	999
	That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,	999
	Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.	999
	Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,	999
	See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:	999
	Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;	999
	Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,	999
	Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;	999
	My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;	999
	And if mine arm be heaved in the air,	999
	Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.	999
	As for words, whose greatness answers words,	999
	Let this my sword report what speech forbears.	999
	999
CADE	By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I	999
	heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out	999
	the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou	999
	sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my knees thou	999
	mayst be turned to hobnails.	999
	999
	[Here they fight. CADE falls]	999
	999
	O, I am slain! famine and no other hath slain me:	999
	let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me	999
	but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them	999
	all. Wither, garden; and be henceforth a	999
	burying-place to all that do dwell in this house,	999
	because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.	999
	999
IDEN	Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?	999
	Sword, I will hollow thee for this thy deed,	999
	And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead:	999
	Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point;	999
	But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,	999
	To emblaze the honour that thy master got.	999
	999
CADE	Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell	999
	Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort	999
	all the world to be cowards; for I, that never	999
	feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valour.	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
IDEN	How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.	999
	Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee;	999
	And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,	999
	So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.	999
	Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels	999
	Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,	999
	And there cut off thy most ungracious head;	999
	Which I will bear in triumph to the king,	999
	Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.	999

SCENE I	Fields between Dartford and Blackheath.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter YORK, and his army of Irish, with drum	999
	and colours]	999
	999
YORK	From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,	999
	And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:	999
	Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,	999
	To entertain great England's lawful king.	999
	Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?	999
	Let them obey that know not how to rule;	999
	This hand was made to handle naught but gold.	999
	I cannot give due action to my words,	999
	Except a sword or sceptre balance it:	999
	A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul,	999
	On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.	999
	999
	[Enter BUCKINGHAM]	999
	999
	Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?	999
	The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.	999
	999
YORK	Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.	999
	Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,	999
	To know the reason of these arms in peace;	999
	Or why thou, being a subject as I am,	999
	Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,	999
	Should raise so great a power without his leave,	999
	Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.	999
	999
YORK	[Aside]  Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great:	999
	O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,	999
	I am so angry at these abject terms;	999
	And now, like Ajax Telamonius,	999
	On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.	999
	I am far better born than is the king,	999
	More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts:	999
	But I must make fair weather yet a while,	999
	Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--	999
	Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,	999
	That I have given no answer all this while;	999
	My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.	999
	The cause why I have brought this army hither	999
	Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,	999
	Seditious to his grace and to the state.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	That is too much presumption on thy part:	999
	But if thy arms be to no other end,	999
	The king hath yielded unto thy demand:	999
	The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.	999
	999
YORK	Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.	999
	999
YORK	Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.	999
	Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;	999
	Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field,	999
	You shall have pay and every thing you wish.	999
	And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,	999
	Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,	999
	As pledges of my fealty and love;	999
	I'll send them all as willing as I live:	999
	Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,	999
	Is his to use, so Somerset may die.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	York, I commend this kind submission:	999
	We twain will go into his highness' tent.	999
	999
	[Enter KING HENRY VI and Attendants]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,	999
	That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?	999
	999
YORK	In all submission and humility	999
	York doth present himself unto your highness.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?	999
	999
YORK	To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,	999
	And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,	999
	Who since I heard to be discomfited.	999
	999
	[Enter IDEN, with CADE'S head]	999
	999
IDEN	If one so rude and of so mean condition	999
	May pass into the presence of a king,	999
	Lo, I present your grace a traitor's head,	999
	The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!	999
	O, let me view his visage, being dead,	999
	That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.	999
	Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?	999
	999
IDEN	I was, an't like your majesty.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree?	999
	999
IDEN	Alexander Iden, that's my name;	999
	A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss	999
	He were created knight for his good service.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Iden, kneel down.	999
	999
	[He kneels]	999
	999
	Rise up a knight.	999
	We give thee for reward a thousand marks,	999
	And will that thou henceforth attend on us.	999

	999
	[Enter QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the queen:	999
	Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,	999
	But boldly stand and front him to his face.	999
	999
YORK	How now! is Somerset at liberty?	999
	Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts,	999
	And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.	999
	Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?	999
	False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,	999
	Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?	999
	King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,	999
	Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,	999
	Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.	999
	That head of thine doth not become a crown;	999
	Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,	999
	And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.	999
	That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,	999
	Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,	999
	Is able with the change to kill and cure.	999
	Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up	999
	And with the same to act controlling laws.	999
	Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more	999
	O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.	999
	999
SOMERSET	O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,	999
	Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown;	999
	Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.	999
	999
YORK	Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,	999
	If they can brook I bow a knee to man.	999
	Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;	999
	999
	[Exit Attendant]	999
	999
	I know, ere they will have me go to ward,	999
	They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,	999
	To say if that the bastard boys of York	999
	Shall be the surety for their traitor father.	999
	999
	[Exit BUCKINGHAM]	999
	999
YORK	O blood-besotted Neapolitan,	999
	Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!	999
	The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,	999
	Shall be their father's bail; and bane to those	999
	That for my surety will refuse the boys!	999
	999
	[Enter EDWARD and RICHARD]	999
	999
	See where they come: I'll warrant they'll	999
	make it good.	999
	999
	[Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORD]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Health and all happiness to my lord the king!	999
	999
	[Kneels]	999
	999
YORK	I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?	999
	Nay, do not fright us with an angry look;	999
	We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again;	999
	For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	This is my king, York, I do not mistake;	999
	But thou mistakest me much to think I do:	999
	To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour	999
	Makes him oppose himself against his king.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,	999
	And chop away that factious pate of his.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	He is arrested, but will not obey;	999
	His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.	999
	999
YORK	Will you not, sons?	999
	999
EDWARD	Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.	999
	999
RICHARD	And if words will not, then our weapons shall.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!	999
	999
YORK	Look in a glass, and call thy image so:	999
	I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.	999
	Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,	999
	That with the very shaking of their chains	999
	They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:	999
	Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.	999
	999
	[Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURY]	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.	999
	And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,	999
	If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.	999
	999
RICHARD	Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur	999
	Run back and bite, because he was withheld;	999
	Who, being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,	999
	Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:	999
	And such a piece of service will you do,	999
	If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,	999
	As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!	999
	999
YORK	Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?	999
	Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,	999
	Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!	999
	What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,	999
	And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?	999
	O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?	999
	If it be banish'd from the frosty head,	999
	Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?	999
	Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,	999
	And shame thine honourable age with blood?	999
	Why art thou old, and want'st experience?	999
	Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?	999
	For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me	999
	That bows unto the grave with mickle age.	999
	999
SALISBURY	My lord, I have consider'd with myself	999
	The title of this most renowned duke;	999
	And in my conscience do repute his grace	999
	The rightful heir to England's royal seat.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?	999
	999
SALISBURY	I have.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?	999
	999
SALISBURY	It is great sin to swear unto a sin,	999
	But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.	999
	Who can be bound by any solemn vow	999
	To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,	999
	To force a spotless virgin's chastity,	999
	To reave the orphan of his patrimony,	999
	To wring the widow from her custom'd right,	999
	And have no other reason for this wrong	999
	But that he was bound by a solemn oath?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	A subtle traitor needs no sophister.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.	999
	999
YORK	Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,	999
	I am resolved for death or dignity.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.	999
	999
WARWICK	You were best to go to bed and dream again,	999
	To keep thee from the tempest of the field.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	I am resolved to bear a greater storm	999
	Than any thou canst conjure up to-day;	999
	And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,	999
	Might I but know thee by thy household badge.	999
	999
WARWICK	Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,	999
	The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,	999
	This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,	999
	As on a mountain top the cedar shows	999
	That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,	999
	Even to affright thee with the view thereof.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear	999
	And tread it under foot with all contempt,	999
	Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.	999
	999
YOUNG CLIFFORD	And so to arms, victorious father,	999
	To quell the rebels and their complices.	999
	999
RICHARD	Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,	999
	For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.	999

	999
WARWICK	Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls:	999
	And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,	999
	Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum	999
	And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,	999
	Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me:	999
	Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland,	999
	Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.	999
	999
	[Enter YORK]	999
	999
	How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?	999
	999
YORK	The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed,	999
	But match to match I have encounter'd him	999
	And made a prey for carrion kites and crows	999
	Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.	999
	999
	[Enter CLIFFORD]	999
	999
WARWICK	Of one or both of us the time is come.	999
	999
YORK	Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,	999
	For I myself must hunt this deer to death.	999
	999
WARWICK	Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.	999
	As I intend, Clifford, to thrive to-day,	999
	It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CLIFFORD	What seest thou in me, York? why dost thou pause?	999
	999
YORK	With thy brave bearing should I be in love,	999
	But that thou art so fast mine enemy.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,	999
	But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.	999
	999
YORK	So let it help me now against thy sword	999
	As I in justice and true right express it.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	My soul and body on the action both!	999
	999
YORK	A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.	999
	999
	[They fight, and CLIFFORD falls]	999
	999
CLIFFORD	La fin couronne les oeuvres.	999
	999
	[Dies]	999

	999
	[Enter YOUNG CLIFFORD]	999
	999
YOUNG CLIFFORD	Shame and confusion! all is on the rout;	999
	Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds	999
	Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,	999
	Whom angry heavens do make their minister	999
	Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part	999
	Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.	999
	He that is truly dedicate to war	999
	Hath no self-love, nor he that loves himself	999
	Hath not essentially but by circumstance	999
	The name of valour.	999
	999
	[Seeing his dead father]	999
	999
	O, let the vile world end,	999
	And the premised flames of the last day	999
	Knit earth and heaven together!	999
	Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,	999
	Particularities and petty sounds	999
	To cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,	999
	To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve	999
	The silver livery of advised age,	999
	And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus	999
	To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight	999
	My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,	999
	It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;	999
	No more will I their babes: tears virginal	999
	Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,	999
	And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims	999
	Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.	999
	Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:	999
	Meet I an infant of the house of York,	999
	Into as many gobbets will I cut it	999
	As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:	999
	In cruelty will I seek out my fame.	999
	Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house:	999
	As did AEneas old Anchises bear,	999
	So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;	999
	But then AEneas bare a living load,	999
	Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.	999

	By what we can, which can no more but fly.	999
	999

	999
	If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom	999

	As well we may, if not through your neglect,	999
	We shall to London get, where you are loved	999
	And where this breach now in our fortunes made	999

	999
	[Re-enter YOUNG CLIFFORD]	999

YOUNG CLIFFORD	But that my heart's on future mischief set,	999

	999
RICHARD	My noble father,	999
	Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,	999
	Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,	999
	Persuaded him from any further act:	999
	But still, where danger was, still there I met him;	999
	And like rich hangings in a homely house,	999

	God knows how long it is I have to live;	999
	And it hath pleased him that three times to-day	999
	You have defended me from imminent death.	999
	Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:	999
	'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,	999
	Being opposites of such repairing nature.	999
	999
YORK	I know our safety is to follow them;	999

	999
	[Alarum. Enter YORK, EDWARD, RICHARD, NORFOLK,	999
	MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers]	999
	999
WARWICK	I wonder how the king escaped our hands.	999
	999
YORK	While we pursued the horsemen of the north,	999
	He slily stole away and left his men:	999
	Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,	999
	Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,	999
	Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,	999
	Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,	999
	Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in	999
	Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.	999
	999
EDWARD	Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,	999
	Is either slain or wounded dangerously;	999
	I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:	999
	That this is true, father, behold his blood.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,	999

	999
	[Throwing down SOMERSET's head]	999
	999
YORK	Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.	999
	But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?	999
	999
NORFOLK	Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!	999
	999
RICHARD	Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.	999
	999
WARWICK	And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,	999
	Before I see thee seated in that throne	999
	Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,	999
	I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.	999
	This is the palace of the fearful king,	999
	And this the regal seat: possess it, York;	999
	For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'	999
	999
YORK	Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;	999
	For hither we have broken in by force.	999
	999
NORFOLK	We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.	999
	999
YORK	Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;	999
	And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.	999
	999
	[They go up]	999
	999
WARWICK	And when the king comes, offer no violence,	999
	Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.	999
	999
YORK	The queen this day here holds her parliament,	999
	But little thinks we shall be of her council:	999
	By words or blows here let us win our right.	999
	999
RICHARD	Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.	999
	999
WARWICK	The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,	999
	Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,	999
	And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice	999
	Hath made us by-words to our enemies.	999
	999
YORK	Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;	999
	I mean to take possession of my right.	999
	999
WARWICK	Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,	999
	The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,	999
	Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.	999
	I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:	999
	Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLIFFORD,	999
	NORTHUMBERLAND, WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and the rest]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,	999
	Even in the chair of state: belike he means,	999
	Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,	999
	To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.	999
	Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.	999
	And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge	999
	On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!	999
	999
CLIFFORD	The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:	999
	My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Patience is for poltroons, such as he:	999
	He durst not sit there, had your father lived.	999
	My gracious lord, here in the parliament	999
	Let us assail the family of York.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Ah, know you not the city favours them,	999
	And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?	999
	999
EXETER	But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,	999
	To make a shambles of the parliament-house!	999
	Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats	999
	Shall be the war that Henry means to use.	999
	Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,	999
	and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;	999
	I am thy sovereign.	999
	999
YORK	I am thine.	999
	999
EXETER	For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.	999
	999
YORK	'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.	999
	999
EXETER	Thy father was a traitor to the crown.	999
	999
WARWICK	Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown	999
	In following this usurping Henry.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Whom should he follow but his natural king?	999
	999
WARWICK	True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?	999
	999
YORK	It must and shall be so: content thyself.	999
	999
WARWICK	Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;	999
	And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.	999
	999
WARWICK	And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget	999
	That we are those which chased you from the field	999
	And slew your fathers, and with colours spread	999
	March'd through the city to the palace gates.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;	999
	And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,	999
	Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives	999
	Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,	999
	I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger	999
	As shall revenge his death before I stir.	999
	999
WARWICK	Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!	999
	999
YORK	Will you we show our title to the crown?	999
	If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?	999
	Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;	999
	Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:	999
	I am the son of Henry the Fifth,	999
	Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop	999
	And seized upon their towns and provinces.	999
	999
WARWICK	Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	The lord protector lost it, and not I:	999
	When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.	999
	999
RICHARD	You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.	999
	Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.	999
	999
EDWARD	Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,	999
	Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.	999
	999
RICHARD	Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.	999
	999
YORK	Sons, peace!	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.	999
	999
WARWICK	Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;	999
	And be you silent and attentive too,	999
	For he that interrupts him shall not live.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,	999
	Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?	999
	No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;	999
	Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,	999
	And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,	999
	Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?	999
	My title's good, and better far than his.	999
	999
WARWICK	Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.	999
	999
YORK	'Twas by rebellion against his king.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	[Aside]  I know not what to say; my title's weak.--	999
	Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?	999
	999
YORK	What then?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	An if he may, then am I lawful king;	999
	For Richard, in the view of many lords,	999
	Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,	999
	Whose heir my father was, and I am his.	999
	999
YORK	He rose against him, being his sovereign,	999
	And made him to resign his crown perforce.	999
	999
WARWICK	Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,	999
	Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?	999
	999
EXETER	No; for he could not so resign his crown	999
	But that the next heir should succeed and reign.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?	999
	999
EXETER	His is the right, and therefore pardon me.	999
	999
YORK	Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?	999
	999
EXETER	My conscience tells me he is lawful king.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	[Aside]  All will revolt from me, and turn to him.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,	999
	Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.	999
	999
WARWICK	Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,	999
	Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,	999
	Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,	999
	Can set the duke up in despite of me.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,	999
	Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:	999
	May that ground gape and swallow me alive,	999
	Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!	999
	999
YORK	Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.	999
	What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?	999
	999
WARWICK	Do right unto this princely Duke of York,	999
	Or I will fill the house with armed men,	999
	And over the chair of state, where now he sits,	999
	Write up his title with usurping blood.	999
	999
	[He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show	999
	themselves]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:	999
	Let me for this my life-time reign as king.	999
	999
YORK	Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,	999
	And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	I am content: Richard Plantagenet,	999
	Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	What wrong is this unto the prince your son!	999
	999
WARWICK	What good is this to England and himself!	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Base, fearful and despairing Henry!	999
	999
CLIFFORD	How hast thou injured both thyself and us!	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	I cannot stay to hear these articles.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Nor I.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,	999
	In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Be thou a prey unto the house of York,	999
	And die in bands for this unmanly deed!	999
	999
CLIFFORD	In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,	999
	Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!	999
	999
	[Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, CLIFFORD, and WESTMORELAND]	999
	999
WARWICK	Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.	999
	999
EXETER	They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Ah, Exeter!	999
	999
WARWICK	          Why should you sigh, my lord?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,	999
	Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.	999
	But be it as it may: I here entail	999
	The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;	999
	Conditionally, that here thou take an oath	999
	To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,	999
	To honour me as thy king and sovereign,	999
	And neither by treason nor hostility	999
	To seek to put me down and reign thyself.	999
	999
YORK	This oath I willingly take and will perform.	999
	999
WARWICK	Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	And long live thou and these thy forward sons!	999
	999
YORK	Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.	999
	999
EXETER	Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!	999
	999
	[Sennet. Here they come down]	999
	999
YORK	Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.	999
	999
WARWICK	And I'll keep London with my soldiers.	999
	999
NORFOLK	And I to Norfolk with my followers.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	And I unto the sea from whence I came.	999
	999
	[Exeunt YORK, EDWARD, EDMUND, GEORGE, RICHARD,	999
	WARWICK, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, their Soldiers, and	999
	Attendants]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.	999
	999
	[Enter QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD]	999
	999
EXETER	Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:	999
	I'll steal away.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	                  Exeter, so will I.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Who can be patient in such extremes?	999
	Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid	999
	And never seen thee, never borne thee son,	999
	Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father	999
	Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?	999
	Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,	999
	Or felt that pain which I did for him once,	999
	Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,	999
	Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,	999
	Rather than have that savage duke thine heir	999
	And disinherited thine only son.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	Father, you cannot disinherit me:	999
	If you be king, why should not I succeed?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:	999
	The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?	999
	I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!	999
	Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;	999
	And given unto the house of York such head	999
	As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.	999
	To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,	999
	What is it, but to make thy sepulchre	999
	And creep into it far before thy time?	999
	Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;	999
	Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;	999
	The duke is made protector of the realm;	999
	And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds	999
	The trembling lamb environed with wolves.	999
	Had I been there, which am a silly woman,	999
	The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes	999
	Before I would have granted to that act.	999
	But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:	999
	And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself	999
	Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,	999
	Until that act of parliament be repeal'd	999
	Whereby my son is disinherited.	999
	The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours	999
	Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;	999
	And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace	999
	And utter ruin of the house of York.	999
	Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;	999
	Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	When I return with victory from the field	999
	I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.	999
	999
	[Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Poor queen! how love to me and to her son	999
	Hath made her break out into terms of rage!	999
	Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,	999
	Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,	999
	Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle	999
	Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!	999
	The loss of those three lords torments my heart:	999
	I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.	999
	Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.	999
	999
EXETER	And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.	999

	999
	[Enter RICHARD, EDWARD, and MONTAGUE]	999
	999
RICHARD	Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.	999
	999
EDWARD	No, I can better play the orator.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	But I have reasons strong and forcible.	999
	999
	[Enter YORK]	999
	999
YORK	Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?	999
	What is your quarrel? how began it first?	999
	999
EDWARD	No quarrel, but a slight contention.	999
	999
YORK	About what?	999
	999
RICHARD	About that which concerns your grace and us;	999
	The crown of England, father, which is yours.	999
	999
YORK	Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.	999
	999
RICHARD	Your right depends not on his life or death.	999
	999
EDWARD	Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:	999
	By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,	999
	It will outrun you, father, in the end.	999
	999
YORK	I took an oath that he should quietly reign.	999
	999
EDWARD	But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:	999
	I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.	999
	999
RICHARD	No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.	999
	999
YORK	I shall be, if I claim by open war.	999
	999
RICHARD	I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.	999
	999
YORK	Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.	999
	999
RICHARD	An oath is of no moment, being not took	999
	Before a true and lawful magistrate,	999
	That hath authority over him that swears:	999
	Henry had none, but did usurp the place;	999
	Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,	999
	Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.	999
	Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think	999
	How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;	999
	Within whose circuit is Elysium	999
	And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.	999
	Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest	999
	Until the white rose that I wear be dyed	999
	Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.	999
	999
YORK	Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.	999
	Brother, thou shalt to London presently,	999
	And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.	999
	Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,	999
	And tell him privily of our intent.	999
	You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,	999
	With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:	999
	In them I trust; for they are soldiers,	999
	Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.	999
	While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,	999
	But that I seek occasion how to rise,	999
	And yet the king not privy to my drift,	999
	Nor any of the house of Lancaster?	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
	But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?	999
	999
Messenger	The queen with all the northern earls and lords	999
	Intend here to besiege you in your castle:	999
	She is hard by with twenty thousand men;	999
	And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.	999
	999
YORK	Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?	999
	Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;	999
	My brother Montague shall post to London:	999
	Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,	999
	Whom we have left protectors of the king,	999
	With powerful policy strengthen themselves,	999
	And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:	999
	And thus most humbly I do take my leave.	999

	The army of the queen mean to besiege us.	999
	999
JOHN MORTIMER	She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.	999
	999
YORK	What, with five thousand men?	999
	999
RICHARD	Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:	999
	A woman's general; what should we fear?	999
	999
	[A march afar off]	999
	999
EDWARD	I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,	999
	And issue forth and bid them battle straight.	999
	999
YORK	Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,	999
	I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.	999
	Many a battle have I won in France,	999
	When as the enemy hath been ten to one:	999

	999
RUTLAND	Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?	999
	Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!	999
	999
	[Enter CLIFFORD and Soldiers]	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.	999
	As for the brat of this accursed duke,	999
	Whose father slew my father, he shall die.	999
	999
Tutor	And I, my lord, will bear him company.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Soldiers, away with him!	999
	999
Tutor	Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,	999
	Lest thou be hated both of God and man!	999
	999
	[Exit, dragged off by Soldiers]	999
	999
CLIFFORD	How now! is he dead already? or is it fear	999
	That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.	999
	999
RUTLAND	So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch	999
	That trembles under his devouring paws;	999
	And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,	999
	And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.	999
	Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,	999
	And not with such a cruel threatening look.	999
	Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.	999
	I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:	999
	Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood	999
	Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.	999
	999
RUTLAND	Then let my father's blood open it again:	999
	He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine	999
	Were not revenge sufficient for me;	999
	No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves	999
	And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,	999
	It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.	999
	The sight of any of the house of York	999
	Is as a fury to torment my soul;	999
	And till I root out their accursed line	999
	And leave not one alive, I live in hell.	999
	Therefore--	999
	999
	[Lifting his hand]	999
	999
RUTLAND	O, let me pray before I take my death!	999
	To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Such pity as my rapier's point affords.	999
	999
RUTLAND	I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Thy father hath.	999
	999
RUTLAND	                  But 'twas ere I was born.	999
	Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,	999
	Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,	999
	He be as miserably slain as I.	999
	Ah, let me live in prison all my days;	999
	And when I give occasion of offence,	999
	Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	No cause!	999
	Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.	999

	999
YORK	The army of the queen hath got the field:	999
	My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;	999
	And all my followers to the eager foe	999
	Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind	999
	Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.	999
	My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:	999
	But this I know, they have demean'd themselves	999
	Like men born to renown by life or death.	999
	Three times did Richard make a lane to me.	999
	And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'	999
	And full as oft came Edward to my side,	999
	With purple falchion, painted to the hilt	999
	In blood of those that had encounter'd him:	999
	And when the hardiest warriors did retire,	999
	Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'	999
	And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!	999
	A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'	999
	With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!	999
	We bodged again; as I have seen a swan	999

	Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,	999
	And made an evening at the noontide prick.	999
	999
YORK	My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth	999
	A bird that will revenge upon you all:	999
	And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,	999
	Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.	999
	Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?	999
	999
CLIFFORD	So cowards fight when they can fly no further;	999
	So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;	999
	So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,	999
	Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.	999
	999
YORK	O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,	999
	And in thy thought o'er-run my former time;	999
	And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,	999
	And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice	999
	Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!	999
	999
CLIFFORD	I will not bandy with thee word for word,	999
	But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes	999
	I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.	999
	Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much	999
	To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:	999
	What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,	999
	For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,	999
	When he might spurn him with his foot away?	999
	It is war's prize to take all vantages;	999
	And ten to one is no impeach of valour.	999
	999
	[They lay hands on YORK, who struggles]	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	So doth the cony struggle in the net.	999
	999
YORK	So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;	999
	So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	What would your grace have done unto him now?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,	999
	Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,	999
	That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,	999
	Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.	999
	What! was it you that would be England's king?	999
	Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,	999
	And made a preachment of your high descent?	999
	Where are your mess of sons to back you now?	999
	The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?	999
	And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,	999
	Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice	999
	Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?	999
	Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?	999
	Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood	999
	That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,	999
	Made issue from the bosom of the boy;	999
	And if thine eyes can water for his death,	999
	I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.	999
	Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,	999
	I should lament thy miserable state.	999
	I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.	999
	What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails	999
	That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?	999
	Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;	999
	And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.	999
	Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.	999
	Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:	999
	York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.	999
	A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:	999
	Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.	999
	999
	[Putting a paper crown on his head]	999
	999
	Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!	999
	Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,	999
	And this is he was his adopted heir.	999
	But how is it that great Plantagenet	999
	Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?	999
	As I bethink me, you should not be king	999
	Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.	999
	And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,	999
	And rob his temples of the diadem,	999
	Now in his life, against your holy oath?	999
	O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!	999
	Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;	999
	And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	That is my office, for my father's sake.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.	999
	999
YORK	She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,	999
	Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!	999
	How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex	999
	To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,	999
	Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!	999
	But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,	999
	Made impudent with use of evil deeds,	999
	I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.	999
	To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,	999
	Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.	999
	Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,	999
	Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,	999
	Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.	999
	Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?	999
	It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,	999
	Unless the adage must be verified,	999
	That beggars mounted run their horse to death.	999
	'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;	999
	But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:	999
	'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;	999
	The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:	999
	'Tis government that makes them seem divine;	999
	The want thereof makes thee abominable:	999
	Thou art as opposite to every good	999
	As the Antipodes are unto us,	999
	Or as the south to the septentrion.	999
	O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!	999
	How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,	999
	To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,	999
	And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?	999
	Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;	999
	Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.	999
	Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:	999
	Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:	999
	For raging wind blows up incessant showers,	999
	And when the rage allays, the rain begins.	999
	These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:	999
	And every drop cries vengeance for his death,	999
	'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false	999
	Frenchwoman.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so	999
	That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.	999
	999
YORK	That face of his the hungry cannibals	999
	Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:	999
	But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,	999
	O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.	999
	See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:	999
	This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,	999
	And I with tears do wash the blood away.	999
	Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:	999
	And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,	999
	Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;	999
	Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,	999
	And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'	999
	There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;	999
	And in thy need such comfort come to thee	999
	As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!	999
	Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:	999
	My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,	999
	I should not for my life but weep with him.	999
	To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?	999
	Think but upon the wrong he did us all,	999
	And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.	999
	999
	[Stabbing him]	999
	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	And here's to right our gentle-hearted king.	999
	999
	[Stabbing him]	999
	999
YORK	Open Thy gate of mercy, gracious God!	999
	My soul flies through these wounds to seek out Thee.	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Off with his head, and set it on York gates;	999
	So York may overlook the town of York.	999

	3 KING HENRY VI	999
	999
	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire.	999
	999
	999
	[A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power]	999
	999
EDWARD	I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,	999
	Or whether he be 'scaped away or no	999
	From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:	999
	Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;	999
	Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;	999
	Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard	999
	The happy tidings of his good escape.	999
	How fares my brother? why is he so sad?	999
	999
RICHARD	I cannot joy, until I be resolved	999
	Where our right valiant father is become.	999
	I saw him in the battle range about;	999
	And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.	999
	Methought he bore him in the thickest troop	999
	As doth a lion in a herd of neat;	999
	Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,	999
	Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,	999
	The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.	999
	So fared our father with his enemies;	999
	So fled his enemies my warlike father:	999
	Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.	999
	See how the morning opes her golden gates,	999
	And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!	999
	How well resembles it the prime of youth,	999
	Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!	999
	999
EDWARD	Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?	999
	999
RICHARD	Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;	999
	Not separated with the racking clouds,	999
	But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.	999
	See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,	999
	As if they vow'd some league inviolable:	999
	Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.	999
	In this the heaven figures some event.	999
	999
EDWARD	'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.	999
	I think it cites us, brother, to the field,	999
	That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,	999
	Each one already blazing by our meeds,	999
	Should notwithstanding join our lights together	999
	And over-shine the earth as this the world.	999
	Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear	999
	Upon my target three fair-shining suns.	999
	999
RICHARD	Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,	999
	You love the breeder better than the male.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
	But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell	999
	Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?	999
	999
Messenger	Ah, one that was a woful looker-on	999
	When as the noble Duke of York was slain,	999
	Your princely father and my loving lord!	999
	999
EDWARD	O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.	999
	999
RICHARD	Say how he died, for I will hear it all.	999
	999
Messenger	Environed he was with many foes,	999
	And stood against them, as the hope of Troy	999
	Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.	999
	But Hercules himself must yield to odds;	999
	And many strokes, though with a little axe,	999
	Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.	999
	By many hands your father was subdued;	999
	But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm	999
	Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,	999
	Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,	999
	Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,	999
	The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks	999
	A napkin steeped in the harmless blood	999
	Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:	999
	And after many scorns, many foul taunts,	999
	They took his head, and on the gates of York	999
	They set the same; and there it doth remain,	999
	The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.	999
	999
EDWARD	Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,	999
	Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.	999
	O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain	999
	The flower of Europe for his chivalry;	999
	And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,	999
	For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.	999
	Now my soul's palace is become a prison:	999
	Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body	999
	Might in the ground be closed up in rest!	999
	For never henceforth shall I joy again,	999
	Never, O never shall I see more joy!	999
	999
RICHARD	 I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture	999
	Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:	999
	Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;	999
	For selfsame wind that I should speak withal	999
	Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,	999
	And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.	999
	To weep is to make less the depth of grief:	999
	Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me	999
	Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,	999
	Or die renowned by attempting it.	999
	999
EDWARD	His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;	999
	His dukedom and his chair with me is left.	999
	999
RICHARD	Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,	999
	Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:	999
	For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;	999
	Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.	999
	999
	[March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army]	999
	999
WARWICK	How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?	999
	999
RICHARD	Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount	999
	Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance	999
	Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,	999
	The words would add more anguish than the wounds.	999
	O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!	999
	999
EDWARD	O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,	999
	Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,	999
	Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.	999
	999
WARWICK	Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;	999
	And now, to add more measure to your woes,	999
	I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.	999
	After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,	999
	Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,	999
	Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,	999
	Were brought me of your loss and his depart.	999
	I, then in London keeper of the king,	999
	Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,	999
	And very well appointed, as I thought,	999
	March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,	999
	Bearing the king in my behalf along;	999
	For by my scouts I was advertised	999
	That she was coming with a full intent	999
	To dash our late decree in parliament	999
	Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.	999
	Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met	999
	Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:	999
	But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,	999
	Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,	999
	That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;	999
	Or whether 'twas report of her success;	999
	Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,	999
	Who thunders to his captives blood and death,	999
	I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,	999
	Their weapons like to lightning came and went;	999
	Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,	999
	Or like an idle thresher with a flail,	999
	Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.	999
	I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,	999
	With promise of high pay and great rewards:	999
	But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,	999
	And we in them no hope to win the day;	999
	So that we fled; the king unto the queen;	999
	Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,	999
	In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:	999
	For in the marches here we heard you were,	999
	Making another head to fight again.	999
	999
EDWARD	Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?	999
	And when came George from Burgundy to England?	999
	999
WARWICK	Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;	999
	And for your brother, he was lately sent	999
	From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,	999
	With aid of soldiers to this needful war.	999
	999
RICHARD	'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:	999
	Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,	999
	But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.	999
	999
WARWICK	Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;	999
	For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine	999
	Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,	999
	And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,	999
	Were he as famous and as bold in war	999
	As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.	999
	999
RICHARD	I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:	999
	'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.	999
	But in this troublous time what's to be done?	999
	Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,	999
	And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,	999
	Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?	999
	Or shall we on the helmets of our foes	999
	Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?	999
	If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.	999
	999
WARWICK	Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;	999
	And therefore comes my brother Montague.	999
	Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,	999
	With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,	999
	And of their feather many more proud birds,	999
	Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.	999
	He swore consent to your succession,	999
	His oath enrolled in the parliament;	999
	And now to London all the crew are gone,	999
	To frustrate both his oath and what beside	999
	May make against the house of Lancaster.	999
	Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:	999
	Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,	999
	With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,	999
	Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,	999
	Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,	999
	Why, Via! to London will we march amain,	999
	And once again bestride our foaming steeds,	999
	And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'	999
	But never once again turn back and fly.	999
	999
RICHARD	Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:	999
	Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,	999
	That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.	999
	999
EDWARD	Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;	999
	And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--	999
	Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!	999
	999
WARWICK	No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:	999
	The next degree is England's royal throne;	999
	For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd	999
	In every borough as we pass along;	999
	And he that throws not up his cap for joy	999
	Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.	999
	King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,	999
	Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,	999
	But sound the trumpets, and about our task.	999
	999
RICHARD	Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,	999
	As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,	999
	I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.	999
	999
EDWARD	Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
WARWICK	How now! what news?	999
	999
Messenger	The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,	999
	The queen is coming with a puissant host;	999
	And craves your company for speedy counsel.	999
	999
WARWICK	Why then it sorts, brave warriors, let's away.	999

	999
SCENE II	Before York.	999
	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET,	999
	PRINCE EDWARD, CLIFFORD, and NORTHUMBERLAND, with	999
	drum and trumpets]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.	999
	Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy	999
	That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:	999
	Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:	999
	To see this sight, it irks my very soul.	999
	Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,	999
	Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	My gracious liege, this too much lenity	999
	And harmful pity must be laid aside.	999
	To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?	999
	Not to the beast that would usurp their den.	999
	Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?	999
	Not his that spoils her young before her face.	999
	Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?	999
	Not he that sets his foot upon her back.	999
	The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,	999
	And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.	999
	Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,	999
	Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:	999
	He, but a duke, would have his son a king,	999
	And raise his issue, like a loving sire;	999
	Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,	999
	Didst yield consent to disinherit him,	999
	Which argued thee a most unloving father.	999
	Unreasonable creatures feed their young;	999
	And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,	999
	Yet, in protection of their tender ones,	999
	Who hath not seen them, even with those wings	999
	Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,	999
	Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,	999
	Offer their own lives in their young's defence?	999
	For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!	999
	Were it not pity that this goodly boy	999
	Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,	999
	And long hereafter say unto his child,	999
	'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got	999
	My careless father fondly gave away'?	999
	Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;	999
	And let his manly face, which promiseth	999
	Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart	999
	To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,	999
	Inferring arguments of mighty force.	999
	But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear	999
	That things ill-got had ever bad success?	999
	And happy always was it for that son	999
	Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?	999
	I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;	999
	And would my father had left me no more!	999
	For all the rest is held at such a rate	999
	As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep	999
	Than in possession and jot of pleasure.	999
	Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know	999
	How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,	999
	And this soft courage makes your followers faint.	999
	You promised knighthood to our forward son:	999
	Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.	999
	Edward, kneel down.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;	999
	And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.	999
	999
PRINCE	My gracious father, by your kingly leave,	999
	I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,	999
	And in that quarrel use it to the death.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	Royal commanders, be in readiness:	999
	For with a band of thirty thousand men	999
	Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;	999
	And in the towns, as they do march along,	999
	Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:	999
	Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	I would your highness would depart the field:	999
	The queen hath best success when you are absent.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Be it with resolution then to fight.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	My royal father, cheer these noble lords	999
	And hearten those that fight in your defence:	999
	Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'	999
	999
	[March. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK,	999
	NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and Soldiers]	999
	999
EDWARD	Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,	999
	And set thy diadem upon my head;	999
	Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!	999
	Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms	999
	Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?	999
	999
EDWARD	I am his king, and he should bow his knee;	999
	I was adopted heir by his consent:	999
	Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,	999
	You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,	999
	Have caused him, by new act of parliament,	999
	To blot out me, and put his own son in.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	And reason too:	999
	Who should succeed the father but the son?	999
	999
RICHARD	Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,	999
	Or any he the proudest of thy sort.	999
	999
RICHARD	'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.	999
	999
RICHARD	For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.	999
	999
WARWICK	What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?	999
	When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,	999
	Your legs did better service than your hands.	999
	999
WARWICK	Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	You said so much before, and yet you fled.	999
	999
WARWICK	'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.	999
	999
RICHARD	Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.	999
	Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain	999
	The execution of my big-swoln heart	999
	Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?	999
	999
RICHARD	Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,	999
	As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;	999
	But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:	999
	I am a king, and privileged to speak.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here	999
	Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.	999
	999
RICHARD	Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:	999
	By him that made us all, I am resolved	999
	that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.	999
	999
EDWARD	Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?	999
	A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,	999
	That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.	999
	999
WARWICK	If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;	999
	For York in justice puts his armour on.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	If that be right which Warwick says is right,	999
	There is no wrong, but every thing is right.	999
	999
RICHARD	Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;	999
	For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;	999
	But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,	999
	Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,	999
	As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.	999
	999
RICHARD	Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,	999
	Whose father bears the title of a king,--	999
	As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--	999
	Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,	999
	To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?	999
	999
EDWARD	A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,	999
	To make this shameless callet know herself.	999
	Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,	999
	Although thy husband may be Menelaus;	999
	And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd	999
	By that false woman, as this king by thee.	999
	His father revell'd in the heart of France,	999
	And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;	999
	And had he match'd according to his state,	999
	He might have kept that glory to this day;	999
	But when he took a beggar to his bed,	999
	And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,	999
	Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,	999
	That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,	999
	And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.	999
	For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?	999
	Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;	999
	And we, in pity of the gentle king,	999
	Had slipp'd our claim until another age.	999
	999
GEORGE	But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,	999
	And that thy summer bred us no increase,	999
	We set the axe to thy usurping root;	999
	And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,	999
	Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,	999
	We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,	999
	Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.	999
	999
EDWARD	And, in this resolution, I defy thee;	999
	Not willing any longer conference,	999
	Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.	999
	Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!	999
	And either victory, or else a grave.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Stay, Edward.	999
	999
EDWARD	No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:	999
	These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.	999

	Yorkshire.	999
	999
	999
	[Alarum. Excursions. Enter WARWICK]	999
	999
WARWICK	Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,	999
	I lay me down a little while to breathe;	999
	For strokes received, and many blows repaid,	999
	Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,	999
	And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.	999
	999
	[Enter EDWARD, running]	999
	999
EDWARD	Smile, gentle heaven! or strike, ungentle death!	999
	For this world frowns, and Edward's sun is clouded.	999
	999
WARWICK	How now, my lord! what hap? what hope of good?	999
	999
	[Enter GEORGE]	999
	999
GEORGE	Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;	999
	Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:	999
	What counsel give you? whither shall we fly?	999
	999
EDWARD	Bootless is flight, they follow us with wings;	999
	And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.	999
	999
	[Enter RICHARD]	999
	999
RICHARD	Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?	999
	Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,	999
	Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;	999
	And in the very pangs of death he cried,	999
	Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,	999
	'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'	999
	So, underneath the belly of their steeds,	999
	That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,	999
	The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.	999
	999
WARWICK	Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:	999
	I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.	999
	Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,	999
	Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;	999
	And look upon, as if the tragedy	999
	Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?	999
	Here on my knee I vow to God above,	999
	I'll never pause again, never stand still,	999
	Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine	999
	Or fortune given me measure of revenge.	999
	999
EDWARD	O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;	999
	And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!	999
	And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,	999
	I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,	999
	Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,	999
	Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands	999
	That to my foes this body must be prey,	999
	Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,	999
	And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!	999
	Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,	999
	Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.	999
	999
RICHARD	Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,	999
	Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:	999
	I, that did never weep, now melt with woe	999
	That winter should cut off our spring-time so.	999
	999
WARWICK	Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell.	999
	999
GEORGE	Yet let us all together to our troops,	999
	And give them leave to fly that will not stay;	999
	And call them pillars that will stand to us;	999
	And, if we thrive, promise them such rewards	999
	As victors wear at the Olympian games:	999
	This may plant courage in their quailing breasts;	999
	For yet is hope of life and victory.	999
	Forslow no longer, make we hence amain.	999

RICHARD	Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:	999
	Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,	999
	And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,	999
	Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:	999
	This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;	999
	And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;	999
	And here's the heart that triumphs in their death	999
	And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother	999
	To execute the like upon thyself;	999
	And so, have at thee!	999

	999
	999
	[Alarum. Enter KING HENRY VI alone]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	This battle fares like to the morning's war,	999
	When dying clouds contend with growing light,	999
	What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,	999
	Can neither call it perfect day nor night.	999
	Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea	999
	Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;	999
	Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea	999
	Forced to retire by fury of the wind:	999
	Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;	999
	Now one the better, then another best;	999
	Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,	999
	Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:	999
	So is the equal of this fell war.	999
	Here on this molehill will I sit me down.	999
	To whom God will, there be the victory!	999
	For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,	999
	Have chid me from the battle; swearing both	999
	They prosper best of all when I am thence.	999
	Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;	999
	For what is in this world but grief and woe?	999
	O God! methinks it were a happy life,	999
	To be no better than a homely swain;	999
	To sit upon a hill, as I do now,	999
	To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,	999
	Thereby to see the minutes how they run,	999
	How many make the hour full complete;	999
	How many hours bring about the day;	999
	How many days will finish up the year;	999
	How many years a mortal man may live.	999
	When this is known, then to divide the times:	999
	So many hours must I tend my flock;	999
	So many hours must I take my rest;	999
	So many hours must I contemplate;	999
	So many hours must I sport myself;	999
	So many days my ewes have been with young;	999
	So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:	999
	So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:	999
	So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,	999
	Pass'd over to the end they were created,	999
	Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.	999
	Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!	999
	Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade	999
	To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,	999
	Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy	999
	To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?	999
	O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.	999
	And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,	999
	His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.	999
	His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,	999
	All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,	999
	Is far beyond a prince's delicates,	999
	His viands sparkling in a golden cup,	999
	His body couched in a curious bed,	999
	When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.	999
	999
	[Alarum. Enter a Son that has killed his father,	999

	999
Son	Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.	999
	This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,	999
	May be possessed with some store of crowns;	999
	And I, that haply take them from him now,	999
	May yet ere night yield both my life and them	999
	To some man else, as this dead man doth me.	999
	Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,	999
	Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.	999
	O heavy times, begetting such events!	999
	From London by the king was I press'd forth;	999
	My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,	999
	Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;	999
	And I, who at his hands received my life, him	999
	Have by my hands of life bereaved him.	999
	Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!	999
	And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!	999
	My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;	999
	And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!	999
	Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,	999
	Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.	999
	Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;	999
	And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,	999
	Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.	999
	999
	[Enter a Father that has killed his son, bringing in the body]	999
	999
Father	Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,	999
	Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:	999
	For I have bought it with an hundred blows.	999
	But let me see: is this our foeman's face?	999
	Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!	999
	Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,	999
	Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,	999
	Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,	999
	Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!	999
	O, pity, God, this miserable age!	999
	What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,	999
	Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,	999
	This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!	999
	O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,	999
	And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!	999
	O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!	999
	O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!	999
	The red rose and the white are on his face,	999
	The fatal colours of our striving houses:	999
	The one his purple blood right well resembles;	999
	The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:	999
	Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;	999
	If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.	999
	999
Son	How will my mother for a father's death	999
	Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!	999
	999
Father	How will my wife for slaughter of my son	999
	Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	How will the country for these woful chances	999
	Misthink the king and not be satisfied!	999

Son	Was ever son so rued a father's death?	999
	999
Father	Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?	999
	Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.	999
	999
Son	I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.	999
	999
	[Exit with the body]	999
	999
Father	These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;	999
	My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,	999
	For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;	999
	My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;	999
	And so obsequious will thy father be,	999
	Even for the loss of thee, having no more,	999
	As Priam was for all his valiant sons.	999
	I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,	999

	[A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded]	999
	999
CLIFFORD	Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,	999
	Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.	999
	O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow	999
	More than my body's parting with my soul!	999
	My love and fear glued many friends to thee;	999
	And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.	999
	Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,	999
	The common people swarm like summer flies;	999
	And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?	999
	And who shines now but Henry's enemies?	999
	O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent	999
	That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,	999
	Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!	999
	And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,	999
	Or as thy father and his father did,	999
	Giving no ground unto the house of York,	999
	They never then had sprung like summer flies;	999
	I and ten thousand in this luckless realm	999
	Had left no mourning widows for our death;	999
	And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.	999
	For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?	999
	And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?	999
	Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;	999
	No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:	999
	The foe is merciless, and will not pity;	999
	For at their hands I have deserved no pity.	999
	The air hath got into my deadly wounds,	999
	And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.	999
	Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;	999
	I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.	999
	999
	[He faints]	999
	999
	[Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD,	999
	MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers]	999
	999
EDWARD	Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,	999
	And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.	999
	Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,	999
	That led calm Henry, though he were a king,	999
	As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,	999
	Command an argosy to stem the waves.	999
	But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?	999
	999
WARWICK	No, 'tis impossible he should escape,	999
	For, though before his face I speak the words	999
	Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:	999
	And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.	999
	999
	[CLIFFORD groans, and dies]	999
	999
EDWARD	Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?	999
	999
RICHARD	A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.	999
	999
EDWARD	See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,	999
	If friend or foe, let him be gently used.	999
	999
RICHARD	Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;	999
	Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch	999
	In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,	999
	But set his murdering knife unto the root	999
	From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,	999
	I mean our princely father, Duke of York.	999
	999
WARWICK	From off the gates of York fetch down the head,	999
	Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;	999
	Instead whereof let this supply the room:	999
	Measure for measure must be answered.	999
	999
EDWARD	Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,	999
	That nothing sung but death to us and ours:	999
	Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,	999
	And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.	999
	999
WARWICK	I think his understanding is bereft.	999
	Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?	999
	Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,	999
	And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.	999
	999
RICHARD	O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:	999
	'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,	999
	Because he would avoid such bitter taunts	999
	Which in the time of death he gave our father.	999
	999
GEORGE	If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.	999
	999
RICHARD	Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.	999
	999
EDWARD	Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.	999
	999
WARWICK	Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.	999
	999
GEORGE	While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.	999
	999
RICHARD	Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.	999
	999
EDWARD	Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.	999
	999
GEORGE	Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?	999
	999
WARWICK	They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.	999
	999
RICHARD	What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard	999
	When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.	999
	I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,	999
	If this right hand would buy two hour's life,	999
	That I in all despite might rail at him,	999
	This hand should chop it off, and with the	999
	issuing blood	999
	Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst	999
	York and young Rutland could not satisfy.	999
	999
WARWICK	Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,	999
	And rear it in the place your father's stands.	999
	And now to London with triumphant march,	999
	There to be crowned England's royal king:	999
	From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,	999
	And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:	999
	So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;	999
	And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread	999
	The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;	999
	For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,	999
	Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.	999
	First will I see the coronation;	999
	And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,	999
	To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.	999
	999
EDWARD	Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;	999
	For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,	999
	And never will I undertake the thing	999
	Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.	999
	Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,	999
	And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,	999
	Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.	999
	999
RICHARD	Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;	999
	For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.	999
	999
WARWICK	Tut, that's a foolish observation:	999
	Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,	999
	To see these honours in possession.	999
	999

	999
	999
ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A forest in the north of England.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter two Keepers, with cross-bows in their hands]	999
	999
First Keeper	Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;	999
	For through this laund anon the deer will come;	999
	And in this covert will we make our stand,	999
	Culling the principal of all the deer.	999
	999
Second Keeper	I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.	999
	999
First Keeper	That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow	999
	Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.	999
	Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:	999
	And, for the time shall not seem tedious,	999
	I'll tell thee what befell me on a day	999
	In this self-place where now we mean to stand.	999
	999
Second Keeper	Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.	999
	999
	[Enter KING HENRY VI, disguised, with a prayerbook]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,	999
	To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.	999
	No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;	999
	Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,	999
	Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:	999
	No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,	999
	No humble suitors press to speak for right,	999
	No, not a man comes for redress of thee;	999
	For how can I help them, and not myself?	999
	999
First Keeper	Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:	999
	This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,	999
	For wise men say it is the wisest course.	999
	999
Second Keeper	Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.	999
	999
First Keeper	Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	My queen and son are gone to France for aid;	999
	And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick	999
	Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister	999
	To wife for Edward: if this news be true,	999
	Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;	999
	For Warwick is a subtle orator,	999
	And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.	999
	By this account then Margaret may win him;	999
	For she's a woman to be pitied much:	999
	Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;	999
	Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;	999
	The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;	999
	And Nero will be tainted with remorse,	999
	To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.	999
	Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;	999
	She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,	999
	He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.	999
	She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;	999
	He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;	999
	That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;	999
	Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,	999
	Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,	999
	And in conclusion wins the king from her,	999
	With promise of his sister, and what else,	999
	To strengthen and support King Edward's place.	999
	O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,	999
	Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!	999
	999
Second Keeper	Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	More than I seem, and less than I was born to:	999
	A man at least, for less I should not be;	999
	And men may talk of kings, and why not I?	999
	999
Second Keeper	Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.	999
	999
Second Keeper	But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	My crown is in my heart, not on my head;	999
	Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,	999
	Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:	999
	A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.	999
	999
Second Keeper	Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,	999
	Your crown content and you must be contented	999
	To go along with us; for as we think,	999
	You are the king King Edward hath deposed;	999
	And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance	999
	Will apprehend you as his enemy.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	But did you never swear, and break an oath?	999
	999
Second Keeper	No, never such an oath; nor will not now.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Where did you dwell when I was King of England?	999
	999
Second Keeper	Here in this country, where we now remain.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	I was anointed king at nine months old;	999
	My father and my grandfather were kings,	999
	And you were sworn true subjects unto me:	999
	And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?	999
	999
First Keeper	No;	999
	For we were subjects but while you were king.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?	999
	Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!	999
	Look, as I blow this feather from my face,	999
	And as the air blows it to me again,	999
	Obeying with my wind when I do blow,	999
	And yielding to another when it blows,	999
	Commanded always by the greater gust;	999
	Such is the lightness of you common men.	999
	But do not break your oaths; for of that sin	999
	My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.	999
	Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;	999
	And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.	999
	999
First Keeper	We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	So would you be again to Henry,	999
	If he were seated as King Edward is.	999
	999
First Keeper	We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,	999
	To go with us unto the officers.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:	999
	And what God will, that let your king perform;	999
	And what he will, I humbly yield unto.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	London. The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and	999
	LADY GREY]	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field	999
	This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,	999
	His lands then seized on by the conqueror:	999
	Her suit is now to repossess those lands;	999
	Which we in justice cannot well deny,	999
	Because in quarrel of the house of York	999
	The worthy gentleman did lose his life.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;	999
	It were dishonour to deny it her.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  Yea, is it so?	999
	I see the lady hath a thing to grant,	999
	Before the king will grant her humble suit.	999
	999
CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He knows the game: how true	999
	he keeps the wind!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  Silence!	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Widow, we will consider of your suit;	999
	And come some other time to know our mind.	999
	999
LADY GREY	Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:	999
	May it please your highness to resolve me now;	999
	And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, widow? then I'll warrant	999
	you all your lands,	999
	An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.	999
	Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.	999
	999
CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I fear her not, unless she	999
	chance to fall.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that! for he'll	999
	take vantages.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.	999
	999
CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I think he means to beg a	999
	child of her.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  Nay, whip me then: he'll rather	999
	give her two.	999
	999
LADY GREY	Three, my most gracious lord.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  You shall have four, if you'll	999
	be ruled by him.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.	999
	999
LADY GREY	Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, good leave have you; for	999
	you will have leave,	999
	Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.	999
	999
	[GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire]	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?	999
	999
LADY GREY	Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	And would you not do much to do them good?	999
	999
LADY GREY	To do them good, I would sustain some harm.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.	999
	999
LADY GREY	Therefore I came unto your majesty.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.	999
	999
LADY GREY	So shall you bind me to your highness' service.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?	999
	999
LADY GREY	What you command, that rests in me to do.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	But you will take exceptions to my boon.	999
	999
LADY GREY	No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.	999
	999
LADY GREY	Why, then I will do what your grace commands.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  He plies her hard; and much rain	999
	wears the marble.	999
	999
CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  As red as fire! nay, then	999
	her wax must melt.	999
	999
LADY GREY	Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.	999
	999
LADY GREY	That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.	999
	999
LADY GREY	I take my leave with many thousand thanks.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  The match is made; she seals it	999
	with a curtsy.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.	999
	999
LADY GREY	The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.	999
	What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?	999
	999
LADY GREY	My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;	999
	That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.	999
	999
LADY GREY	Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	But now you partly may perceive my mind.	999
	999
LADY GREY	My mind will never grant what I perceive	999
	Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.	999
	999
LADY GREY	To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.	999
	999
LADY GREY	Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;	999
	For by that loss I will not purchase them.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.	999
	999
LADY GREY	Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.	999
	But, mighty lord, this merry inclination	999
	Accords not with the sadness of my suit:	999
	Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;	999
	No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.	999
	999
LADY GREY	Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  The widow likes him not, she	999
	knits her brows.	999
	999
CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He is the bluntest wooer in	999
	Christendom.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	[Aside]  Her looks do argue her replete with modesty;	999
	Her words do show her wit incomparable;	999
	All her perfections challenge sovereignty:	999
	One way or other, she is for a king;	999
	And she shall be my love, or else my queen.--	999
	Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?	999
	999
LADY GREY	'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:	999
	I am a subject fit to jest withal,	999
	But far unfit to be a sovereign.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee	999
	I speak no more than what my soul intends;	999
	And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.	999
	999
LADY GREY	And that is more than I will yield unto:	999
	I know I am too mean to be your queen,	999
	And yet too good to be your concubine.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.	999
	999
LADY GREY	'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	No more than when my daughters call thee mother.	999
	Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;	999
	And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,	999
	Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing	999
	To be the father unto many sons.	999
	Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  The ghostly father now hath done	999
	his shrift.	999
	999
CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  When he was made a shriver,	999
	'twas for shift.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	You'll think it strange if I should marry her.	999
	999
CLARENCE	To whom, my lord?	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	                  Why, Clarence, to myself.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	That would be ten days' wonder at the least.	999
	999
CLARENCE	That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	By so much is the wonder in extremes.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both	999
	Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.	999
	999
	[Enter a Nobleman]	999
	999
Nobleman	My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,	999
	And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:	999
	And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,	999
	To question of his apprehension.	999
	Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ay, Edward will use women honourably.	999
	Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,	999
	That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,	999
	To cross me from the golden time I look for!	999
	And yet, between my soul's desire and me--	999
	The lustful Edward's title buried--	999
	Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,	999
	And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,	999
	To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:	999
	A cold premeditation for my purpose!	999
	Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;	999
	Like one that stands upon a promontory,	999
	And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,	999
	Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,	999
	And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,	999
	Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:	999
	So do I wish the crown, being so far off;	999
	And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;	999
	And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,	999
	Flattering me with impossibilities.	999
	My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,	999
	Unless my hand and strength could equal them.	999
	Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;	999
	What other pleasure can the world afford?	999
	I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,	999
	And deck my body in gay ornaments,	999
	And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.	999
	O miserable thought! and more unlikely	999
	Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!	999
	Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:	999
	And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,	999
	She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,	999
	To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;	999
	To make an envious mountain on my back,	999
	Where sits deformity to mock my body;	999
	To shape my legs of an unequal size;	999
	To disproportion me in every part,	999
	Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp	999
	That carries no impression like the dam.	999
	And am I then a man to be beloved?	999
	O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!	999
	Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,	999
	But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such	999
	As are of better person than myself,	999
	I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,	999
	And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,	999
	Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head	999
	Be round impaled with a glorious crown.	999
	And yet I know not how to get the crown,	999
	For many lives stand between me and home:	999
	And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,	999
	That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,	999
	Seeking a way and straying from the way;	999
	Not knowing how to find the open air,	999
	But toiling desperately to find it out,--	999
	Torment myself to catch the English crown:	999
	And from that torment I will free myself,	999
	Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.	999
	Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,	999
	And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,	999
	And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,	999
	And frame my face to all occasions.	999
	I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;	999
	I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;	999
	I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,	999
	Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,	999
	And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.	999
	I can add colours to the chameleon,	999
	Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,	999
	And set the murderous Machiavel to school.	999
	Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?	999
	Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.	999

ACT III	999

	999
SCENE III	France. KING LEWIS XI's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI, his sister BONA,	999
	his Admiral, called BOURBON, PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN	999
	MARGARET, and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI sits, and	999
	riseth up again]	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,	999
	Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state	999
	And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	No, mighty King of France: now Margaret	999
	Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve	999
	Where kings command. I was, I must confess,	999
	Great Albion's queen in former golden days:	999
	But now mischance hath trod my title down,	999
	And with dishonour laid me on the ground;	999
	Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,	999
	And to my humble seat conform myself.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears	999
	And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,	999
	And sit thee by our side:	999
	999
	[Seats her by him]	999
	999
		    Yield not thy neck	999
	To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind	999
	Still ride in triumph over all mischance.	999
	Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;	999
	It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts	999
	And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.	999
	Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,	999
	That Henry, sole possessor of my love,	999
	Is of a king become a banish'd man,	999
	And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;	999
	While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York	999
	Usurps the regal title and the seat	999
	Of England's true-anointed lawful king.	999
	This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,	999
	With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,	999
	Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;	999
	And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:	999
	Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;	999
	Our people and our peers are both misled,	999
	Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,	999
	And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,	999
	While we bethink a means to break it off.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.	999
	And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!	999
	999
	[Enter WARWICK]	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?	999
	999
	[He descends. She ariseth]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;	999
	For this is he that moves both wind and tide.	999
	999
WARWICK	From worthy Edward, King of Albion,	999
	My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,	999
	I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,	999
	First, to do greetings to thy royal person;	999
	And then to crave a league of amity;	999
	And lastly, to confirm that amity	999
	With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant	999
	That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,	999
	To England's king in lawful marriage.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	[Aside]  If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.	999
	999
WARWICK	[To BONA]  And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,	999
	I am commanded, with your leave and favour,	999
	Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue	999
	To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;	999
	Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,	999
	Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,	999
	Before you answer Warwick. His demand	999
	Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,	999
	But from deceit bred by necessity;	999
	For how can tyrants safely govern home,	999
	Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?	999
	To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,	999
	That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,	999
	Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.	999
	Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage	999
	Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;	999
	For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,	999
	Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.	999
	999
WARWICK	Injurious Margaret!	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	And why not queen?	999
	999
WARWICK	Because thy father Henry did usurp;	999
	And thou no more are prince than she is queen.	999
	999
OXFORD	Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,	999
	Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;	999
	And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,	999
	Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;	999
	And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,	999
	Who by his prowess conquered all France:	999
	From these our Henry lineally descends.	999
	999
WARWICK	Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,	999
	You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost	999
	All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?	999
	Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.	999
	But for the rest, you tell a pedigree	999
	Of threescore and two years; a silly time	999
	To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.	999
	999
OXFORD	Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,	999
	Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,	999
	And not bewray thy treason with a blush?	999
	999
WARWICK	Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,	999
	Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?	999
	For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.	999
	999
OXFORD	Call him my king by whose injurious doom	999
	My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,	999
	Was done to death? and more than so, my father,	999
	Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,	999
	When nature brought him to the door of death?	999
	No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,	999
	This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.	999
	999
WARWICK	And I the house of York.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,	999
	Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,	999
	While I use further conference with Warwick.	999
	999
	[They stand aloof]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,	999
	Is Edward your true king? for I were loath	999
	To link with him that were not lawful chosen.	999
	999
WARWICK	Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	But is he gracious in the people's eye?	999
	999
WARWICK	The more that Henry was unfortunate.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Then further, all dissembling set aside,	999
	Tell me for truth the measure of his love	999
	Unto our sister Bona.	999
	999
WARWICK	Such it seems	999
	As may beseem a monarch like himself.	999
	Myself have often heard him say and swear	999
	That this his love was an eternal plant,	999
	Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,	999
	The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,	999
	Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,	999
	Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.	999
	999
BONA	Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:	999
	999
	[To WARWICK]	999
	999
	Yet I confess that often ere this day,	999
	When I have heard your king's desert recounted,	999
	Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;	999
	And now forthwith shall articles be drawn	999
	Touching the jointure that your king must make,	999
	Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.	999
	Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness	999
	That Bona shall be wife to the English king.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	To Edward, but not to the English king.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device	999
	By this alliance to make void my suit:	999
	Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	And still is friend to him and Margaret:	999
	But if your title to the crown be weak,	999
	As may appear by Edward's good success,	999
	Then 'tis but reason that I be released	999
	From giving aid which late I promised.	999
	Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand	999
	That your estate requires and mine can yield.	999
	999
WARWICK	Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,	999
	Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.	999
	And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,	999
	You have a father able to maintain you;	999
	And better 'twere you troubled him than France.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,	999
	Proud setter up and puller down of kings!	999
	I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,	999
	Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold	999
	Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;	999
	For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.	999
	999
	[Post blows a horn within]	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.	999
	999
	[Enter a Post]	999
	999
Post	[To WARWICK]  My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,	999
	Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:	999
	999
	[To KING LEWIS XI]	999
	999
	These from our king unto your majesty:	999
	999
	[To QUEEN MARGARET]	999
	999
	And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.	999
	999
	[They all read their letters]	999
	999
OXFORD	I like it well that our fair queen and mistress	999
	Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:	999
	I hope all's for the best.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.	999
	999
WARWICK	Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	What! has your king married the Lady Grey!	999
	And now, to soothe your forgery and his,	999
	Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?	999
	Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?	999
	Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	I told your majesty as much before:	999
	This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.	999
	999
WARWICK	King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,	999
	And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,	999
	That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,	999
	No more my king, for he dishonours me,	999
	But most himself, if he could see his shame.	999
	Did I forget that by the house of York	999
	My father came untimely to his death?	999
	Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?	999
	Did I impale him with the regal crown?	999
	Did I put Henry from his native right?	999
	And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?	999
	Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:	999
	And to repair my honour lost for him,	999
	I here renounce him and return to Henry.	999
	My noble queen, let former grudges pass,	999
	And henceforth I am thy true servitor:	999
	I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,	999
	And replant Henry in his former state.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;	999
	And I forgive and quite forget old faults,	999
	And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.	999
	999
WARWICK	So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,	999
	That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us	999
	With some few bands of chosen soldiers,	999
	I'll undertake to land them on our coast	999
	And force the tyrant from his seat by war.	999
	'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:	999
	And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,	999
	He's very likely now to fall from him,	999
	For matching more for wanton lust than honour,	999
	Or than for strength and safety of our country.	999
	999
BONA	Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged	999
	But by thy help to this distressed queen?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,	999
	Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?	999
	999
BONA	My quarrel and this English queen's are one.	999
	999
WARWICK	And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.	999
	Therefore at last I firmly am resolved	999
	You shall have aid.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Let me give humble thanks for all at once.	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Then, England's messenger, return in post,	999
	And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,	999
	That Lewis of France is sending over masquers	999
	To revel it with him and his new bride:	999
	Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.	999
	999
BONA	Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,	999
	I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,	999
	And I am ready to put armour on.	999
	999
WARWICK	Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,	999
	And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.	999
	There's thy reward: be gone.	999
	999
	[Exit Post]	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	But, Warwick,	999
	Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,	999
	Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;	999
	And, as occasion serves, this noble queen	999
	And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.	999
	Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,	999
	What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?	999
	999
WARWICK	This shall assure my constant loyalty,	999
	That if our queen and this young prince agree,	999
	I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy	999
	To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.	999
	Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,	999
	Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;	999
	And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,	999
	That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;	999
	And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.	999
	999
	[He gives his hand to WARWICK]	999
	999
KING LEWIS XI	Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,	999
	And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,	999
	Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.	999
	I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,	999
	For mocking marriage with a dame of France.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but WARWICK]	999
	999
WARWICK	I came from Edward as ambassador,	999
	But I return his sworn and mortal foe:	999
	Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,	999
	But dreadful war shall answer his demand.	999
	Had he none else to make a stale but me?	999
	Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.	999
	I was the chief that raised him to the crown,	999
	And I'll be chief to bring him down again:	999
	Not that I pity Henry's misery,	999
	But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.	999

SCENE I	London. The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, SOMERSET, and MONTAGUE]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you	999
	Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?	999
	Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?	999
	999
CLARENCE	Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;	999
	How could he stay till Warwick made return?	999
	999
SOMERSET	My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	And his well-chosen bride.	999
	999
CLARENCE	I mind to tell him plainly what I think.	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, attended; QUEEN	999
	ELIZABETH, PEMBROKE, STAFFORD, HASTINGS, and others]	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,	999
	That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?	999
	999
CLARENCE	As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,	999
	Which are so weak of courage and in judgment	999
	That they'll take no offence at our abuse.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Suppose they take offence without a cause,	999
	They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,	999
	Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	And shall have your will, because our king:	999
	Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Not I:	999
	No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd	999
	Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity	999
	To sunder them that yoke so well together.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,	999
	Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey	999
	Should not become my wife and England's queen.	999
	And you too, Somerset and Montague,	999
	Speak freely what you think.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis	999
	Becomes your enemy, for mocking him	999
	About the marriage of the Lady Bona.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,	999
	Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased	999
	By such invention as I can devise?	999
	999
MONTAGUE	Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance	999
	Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth	999
	'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Why, knows not Montague that of itself	999
	England is safe, if true within itself?	999
	999
MONTAGUE	But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.	999
	999
HASTINGS	'Tis better using France than trusting France:	999
	Let us be back'd with God and with the seas	999
	Which He hath given for fence impregnable,	999
	And with their helps only defend ourselves;	999
	In them and in ourselves our safety lies.	999
	999
CLARENCE	For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves	999
	To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;	999
	And for this once my will shall stand for law.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,	999
	To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales	999
	Unto the brother of your loving bride;	999
	She better would have fitted me or Clarence:	999
	But in your bride you bury brotherhood.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir	999
	Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,	999
	And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife	999
	That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.	999
	999
CLARENCE	In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,	999
	Which being shallow, you give me leave	999
	To play the broker in mine own behalf;	999
	And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,	999
	And not be tied unto his brother's will.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	My lords, before it pleased his majesty	999
	To raise my state to title of a queen,	999
	Do me but right, and you must all confess	999
	That I was not ignoble of descent;	999
	And meaner than myself have had like fortune.	999
	But as this title honours me and mine,	999
	So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,	999
	Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:	999
	What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,	999
	So long as Edward is thy constant friend,	999
	And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?	999
	Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,	999
	Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;	999
	Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,	999
	And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.	999
	999
	[Enter a Post]	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Now, messenger, what letters or what news	999
	From France?	999
	999
Post	My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,	999
	But such as I, without your special pardon,	999
	Dare not relate.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,	999
	Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.	999
	What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?	999
	999
Post	At my depart, these were his very words:	999
	'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,	999
	That Lewis of France is sending over masquers	999
	To revel it with him and his new bride.'	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.	999
	But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?	999
	999
Post	These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:	999
	'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,	999
	I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	I blame not her, she could say little less;	999
	She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?	999
	For I have heard that she was there in place.	999
	999
Post	'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,	999
	And I am ready to put armour on.'	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Belike she minds to play the Amazon.	999
	But what said Warwick to these injuries?	999
	999
Post	He, more incensed against your majesty	999
	Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:	999
	'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,	999
	And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?	999
	Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:	999
	They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.	999
	But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?	999
	999
Post	Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in	999
	friendship	999
	That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.	999
	Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,	999
	For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;	999
	That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage	999
	I may not prove inferior to yourself.	999
	You that love me and Warwick, follow me.	999
	999
	[Exit CLARENCE, and SOMERSET follows]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  Not I:	999
	My thoughts aim at a further matter; I	999
	Stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!	999
	Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;	999
	And haste is needful in this desperate case.	999
	Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf	999
	Go levy men, and make prepare for war;	999
	They are already, or quickly will be landed:	999
	Myself in person will straight follow you.	999
	999
	[Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD]	999
	999
	But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,	999
	Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,	999
	Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:	999
	Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?	999
	If it be so, then both depart to him;	999
	I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:	999
	But if you mind to hold your true obedience,	999
	Give me assurance with some friendly vow,	999
	That I may never have you in suspect.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	So God help Montague as he proves true!	999
	999
HASTINGS	And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Why, so! then am I sure of victory.	999
	Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,	999
	Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.	999

	999

	999
WARWICK	Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;	999
	The common people by numbers swarm to us.	999
	999
	[Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET]	999
	999
	But see where Somerset and Clarence come!	999
	Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?	999
	999
CLARENCE	Fear not that, my lord.	999
	999
WARWICK	Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;	999
	And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice	999
	To rest mistrustful where a noble heart	999
	Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;	999
	Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,	999
	Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:	999
	But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.	999
	And now what rests but, in night's coverture,	999
	Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,	999
	His soldiers lurking in the towns about,	999
	And but attended by a simple guard,	999
	We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?	999
	Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:	999
	That as Ulysses and stout Diomede	999
	With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,	999
	And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,	999
	So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,	999
	At unawares may beat down Edward's guard	999
	And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,	999
	For I intend but only to surprise him.	999
	You that will follow me to this attempt,	999
	Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.	999
	999
	[They all cry, 'Henry!']	999
	999

	[Enter three Watchmen, to guard KING EDWARD IV's tent]	999
	999
First Watchman	Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:	999
	The king by this is set him down to sleep.	999
	999
Second Watchman	What, will he not to bed?	999
	999
First Watchman	Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow	999
	Never to lie and take his natural rest	999
	Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.	999
	999
Second Watchman	To-morrow then belike shall be the day,	999
	If Warwick be so near as men report.	999
	999
Third Watchman	But say, I pray, what nobleman is that	999
	That with the king here resteth in his tent?	999
	999
First Watchman	'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.	999
	999
Third Watchman	O, is it so? But why commands the king	999
	That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,	999
	While he himself keeps in the cold field?	999
	999
Second Watchman	'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.	999
	999
Third Watchman	Ay, but give me worship and quietness;	999
	I like it better than a dangerous honour.	999
	If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,	999
	'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.	999
	999
First Watchman	Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.	999
	999
Second Watchman	Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,	999
	But to defend his person from night-foes?	999
	999
	[Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET, and	999
	French soldiers, silent all]	999
	999
WARWICK	This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.	999
	Courage, my masters! honour now or never!	999
	But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.	999
	999
First Watchman	Who goes there?	999
	999
Second Watchman	Stay, or thou diest!	999
	999
	[WARWICK and the rest cry all, 'Warwick! Warwick!'	999
	and set upon the Guard, who fly, crying, 'Arm!	999
	arm!' WARWICK and the rest following them]	999
	999
	[The drum playing and trumpet sounding, reenter	999
	WARWICK, SOMERSET, and the rest, bringing KING	999
	EDWARD IV out in his gown, sitting in a chair.	999
	RICHARD and HASTINGS fly over the stage]	999
	999
SOMERSET	What are they that fly there?	999
	999
WARWICK	Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	        The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,	999
	Thou call'dst me king.	999
	999
WARWICK	Ay, but the case is alter'd:	999
	When you disgraced me in my embassade,	999
	Then I degraded you from being king,	999
	And come now to create you Duke of York.	999
	Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,	999
	That know not how to use ambassadors,	999
	Nor how to be contented with one wife,	999
	Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,	999
	Nor how to study for the people's welfare,	999
	Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?	999
	Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.	999
	Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,	999
	Of thee thyself and all thy complices,	999
	Edward will always bear himself as king:	999
	Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,	999
	My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.	999
	999
WARWICK	Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:	999
	999
	[Takes off his crown]	999
	999
	But Henry now shall wear the English crown,	999
	And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.	999
	My Lord of Somerset, at my request,	999
	See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd	999
	Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.	999
	When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,	999
	I'll follow you, and tell what answer	999
	Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.	999
	Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.	999
	999
	[They lead him out forcibly]	999

	999
OXFORD	What now remains, my lords, for us to do	999

	999
RIVERS	Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn	999
	What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?	999
	999
RIVERS	What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	No, but the loss of his own royal person.	999
	999
RIVERS	Then is my sovereign slain?	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,	999
	Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard	999
	Or by his foe surprised at unawares:	999
	And, as I further have to understand,	999
	Is new committed to the Bishop of York,	999
	Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.	999
	999
RIVERS	These news I must confess are full of grief;	999
	Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:	999
	Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.	999
	And I the rather wean me from despair	999
	For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:	999
	This is it that makes me bridle passion	999
	And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;	999
	Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear	999
	And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,	999
	Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown	999
	King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown.	999
	999
RIVERS	But, madam, where is Warwick then become?	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	I am inform'd that he comes towards London,	999
	To set the crown once more on Henry's head:	999
	Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,	999
	But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--	999
	For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--	999
	I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,	999
	To save at least the heir of Edward's right:	999
	There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.	999
	Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:	999

	[Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and STANLEY]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,	999
	Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,	999
	Into this chiefest thicket of the park.	999
	Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,	999
	Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands	999
	He hath good usage and great liberty,	999
	And, often but attended with weak guard,	999
	Comes hunting this way to disport himself.	999
	I have advertised him by secret means	999
	That if about this hour he make his way	999
	Under the colour of his usual game,	999
	He shall here find his friends with horse and men	999
	To set him free from his captivity.	999
	999
	[Enter KING EDWARD IV and a Huntsman with him]	999
	999
Huntsman	This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.	999
	Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,	999
	Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Brother, the time and case requireth haste:	999
	Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	But whither shall we then?	999
	999
HASTINGS	To Lynn, my lord,	999
	And ship from thence to Flanders.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.	999
	999

	999
	[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLARENCE, WARWICK,	999
	SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, OXFORD, MONTAGUE, and	999
	Lieutenant of the Tower]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Master lieutenant, now that God and friends	999
	Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,	999
	And turn'd my captive state to liberty,	999
	My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,	999
	At our enlargement what are thy due fees?	999
	999
Lieutenant	Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;	999
	But if an humble prayer may prevail,	999
	I then crave pardon of your majesty.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	For what, lieutenant? for well using me?	999
	Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,	999
	For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;	999
	Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds	999
	Conceive when after many moody thoughts	999
	At last by notes of household harmony	999
	They quite forget their loss of liberty.	999
	But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,	999
	And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;	999
	He was the author, thou the instrument.	999
	Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite	999
	By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,	999
	And that the people of this blessed land	999
	May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,	999
	Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,	999
	I here resign my government to thee,	999
	For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.	999
	999
WARWICK	Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;	999
	And now may seem as wise as virtuous,	999
	By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,	999
	For few men rightly temper with the stars:	999
	Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,	999
	For choosing me when Clarence is in place.	999
	999
CLARENCE	No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,	999
	To whom the heavens in thy nativity	999
	Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,	999
	As likely to be blest in peace and war;	999
	And therefore I yield thee my free consent.	999
	999
WARWICK	And I choose Clarence only for protector.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:	999
	Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,	999
	That no dissension hinder government:	999
	I make you both protectors of this land,	999
	While I myself will lead a private life	999
	And in devotion spend my latter days,	999
	To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.	999
	999
WARWICK	What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?	999
	999
CLARENCE	That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;	999
	For on thy fortune I repose myself.	999
	999
WARWICK	Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:	999
	We'll yoke together, like a double shadow	999
	To Henry's body, and supply his place;	999
	I mean, in bearing weight of government,	999
	While he enjoys the honour and his ease.	999
	And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful	999
	Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,	999
	And all his lands and goods be confiscate.	999
	999
CLARENCE	What else? and that succession be determined.	999
	999
WARWICK	Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	But, with the first of all your chief affairs,	999
	Let me entreat, for I command no more,	999
	That Margaret your queen and my son Edward	999
	Be sent for, to return from France with speed;	999
	For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear	999
	My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.	999
	999
CLARENCE	It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,	999
	Of whom you seem to have so tender care?	999
	999
SOMERSET	My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Come hither, England's hope.	999
	999
	[Lays his hand on his head]	999
	999
		       If secret powers	999
	Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,	999
	This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.	999
	His looks are full of peaceful majesty,	999
	His head by nature framed to wear a crown,	999
	His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself	999
	Likely in time to bless a regal throne.	999
	Make much of him, my lords, for this is he	999
	Must help you more than you are hurt by me.	999
	999
	[Enter a Post]	999
	999
WARWICK	What news, my friend?	999
	999
Post	That Edward is escaped from your brother,	999
	And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.	999
	999
WARWICK	Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?	999
	999
Post	He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester	999
	And the Lord Hastings, who attended him	999
	In secret ambush on the forest side	999
	And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;	999
	For hunting was his daily exercise.	999
	999
WARWICK	My brother was too careless of his charge.	999
	But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide	999
	A salve for any sore that may betide.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, and OXFORD]	999
	999
SOMERSET	My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;	999
	For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,	999
	And we shall have more wars before 't be long.	999
	As Henry's late presaging prophecy	999
	Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,	999
	So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts	999
	What may befall him, to his harm and ours:	999
	Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,	999
	Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,	999
	Till storms be past of civil enmity.	999
	999
OXFORD	Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,	999
	'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.	999
	999
SOMERSET	It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.	999
	Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.	999

SCENE VII	Before York.	999
	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER,	999
	HASTINGS, and Soldiers]	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,	999
	Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,	999
	And says that once more I shall interchange	999
	My waned state for Henry's regal crown.	999
	Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas	999
	And brought desired help from Burgundy:	999
	What then remains, we being thus arrived	999
	From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,	999
	But that we enter, as into our dukedom?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;	999
	For many men that stumble at the threshold	999
	Are well foretold that danger lurks within.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:	999
	By fair or foul means we must enter in,	999
	For hither will our friends repair to us.	999
	999
HASTINGS	My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.	999
	999
	[Enter, on the walls, the Mayor of York, and his Brethren]	999
	999
Mayor	My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,	999
	And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;	999
	For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,	999
	Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.	999
	999
Mayor	True, my good lord; I know you for no less.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,	999
	As being well content with that alone.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  But when the fox hath once got in his nose,	999
	He'll soon find means to make the body follow.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?	999
	Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.	999
	999
Mayor	Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.	999
	999
	[They descend]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!	999
	999
HASTINGS	The good old man would fain that all were well,	999
	So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,	999
	I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade	999
	Both him and all his brothers unto reason.	999
	999
	[Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen, below]	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut	999
	But in the night or in the time of war.	999
	What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;	999
	999
	[Takes his keys]	999
	999
	For Edward will defend the town and thee,	999
	And all those friends that deign to follow me.	999
	999
	[March. Enter MONTGOMERY, with drum and soldiers]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,	999
	Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?	999
	999
MONTAGUE	To help King Edward in his time of storm,	999
	As every loyal subject ought to do.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget	999
	Our title to the crown and only claim	999
	Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	Then fare you well, for I will hence again:	999
	I came to serve a king and not a duke.	999
	Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.	999
	999
	[The drum begins to march]	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate	999
	By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	What talk you of debating? in few words,	999
	If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,	999
	I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone	999
	To keep them back that come to succor you:	999
	Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:	999
	Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.	999
	Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:	999
	The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,	999
	And Henry but usurps the diadem.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;	999
	And now will I be Edward's champion.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:	999
	Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.	999
	999
	[Flourish]	999
	999
Soldier	Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of	999
	England and France, and lord of Ireland, &c.	999
	999
MONTAGUE	And whosoe'er gainsays King Edward's right,	999
	By this I challenge him to single fight.	999
	999
	[Throws down his gauntlet]	999
	999
All	Long live Edward the Fourth!	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:	999
	If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.	999
	Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;	999
	And when the morning sun shall raise his car	999
	Above the border of this horizon,	999
	We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;	999
	For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.	999
	Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee	999
	To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!	999
	Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.	999
	Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,	999
	And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.	999

SCENE VIII	London. The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, WARWICK, MONTAGUE,	999
	CLARENCE, EXETER, and OXFORD]	999
	999
WARWICK	What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,	999
	With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,	999
	Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,	999
	And with his troops doth march amain to London;	999
	And many giddy people flock to him.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Let's levy men, and beat him back again.	999
	999
CLARENCE	A little fire is quickly trodden out;	999
	Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.	999
	999
WARWICK	In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,	999
	Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;	999
	Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence,	999
	Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,	999
	The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:	999
	Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,	999
	Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find	999
	Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:	999
	And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved,	999
	In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.	999
	My sovereign, with the loving citizens,	999
	Like to his island girt in with the ocean,	999
	Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,	999
	Shall rest in London till we come to him.	999
	Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.	999
	Farewell, my sovereign.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope.	999
	999
CLARENCE	In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Well-minded Clarence, be thou fortunate!	999
	999
MONTAGUE	Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.	999
	999
OXFORD	And thus I seal my truth, and bid adieu.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,	999
	And all at once, once more a happy farewell.	999
	999
WARWICK	Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but KING HENRY VI and EXETER]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Here at the palace I will rest awhile.	999
	Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?	999
	Methinks the power that Edward hath in field	999
	Should not be able to encounter mine.	999
	999
EXETER	The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:	999
	I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,	999
	Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;	999
	My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,	999
	My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,	999
	My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;	999
	I have not been desirous of their wealth,	999
	Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.	999
	Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:	999
	Then why should they love Edward more than me?	999
	No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:	999
	And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,	999
	The lamb will never cease to follow him.	999
	999
	[Shout within. 'A Lancaster! A Lancaster!']	999
	999
EXETER	Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?	999
	999
	[Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers]	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;	999
	And once again proclaim us King of England.	999
	You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:	999
	Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,	999
	And swell so much the higher by their ebb.	999
	Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak.	999
	999
	[Exeunt some with KING HENRY VI]	999
	999
	And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course	999
	Where peremptory Warwick now remains:	999
	The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,	999
	Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Away betimes, before his forces join,	999
	And take the great-grown traitor unawares:	999

WARWICK	Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?	999
	How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?	999
	999
First Messenger	By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.	999
	999
WARWICK	How far off is our brother Montague?	999
	Where is the post that came from Montague?	999
	999
Second Messenger	By this at Daintry, with a puissant troop.	999
	999
	[Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE]	999
	999
WARWICK	Say, Somerville, what says my loving son?	999
	And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?	999
	999
SOMERSET	At Southam I did leave him with his forces,	999
	And do expect him here some two hours hence.	999
	999
	[Drum heard]	999
	999
WARWICK	Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.	999
	999
SOMERSET	It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:	999
	The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.	999
	999
WARWICK	Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.	999
	999
SOMERSET	They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.	999
	999
	[March: flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER,	999
	and soldiers]	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!	999
	999
WARWICK	O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?	999
	Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,	999
	That we could hear no news of his repair?	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,	999
	Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,	999
	Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?	999
	And he shall pardon thee these outrages.	999
	999
WARWICK	Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,	999
	Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,	999
	Call Warwick patron and be penitent?	999
	And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I thought, at least, he would have said the king;	999
	Or did he make the jest against his will?	999
	999
WARWICK	Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:	999
	I'll do thee service for so good a gift.	999
	999
WARWICK	'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.	999
	999
WARWICK	Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:	999
	And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;	999
	And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:	999
	And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:	999
	What is the body when the head is off?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,	999
	But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,	999
	The king was slily finger'd from the deck!	999
	You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,	999
	And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower.	999
	999
EDWARD	'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:	999
	Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.	999
	999
WARWICK	I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,	999
	And with the other fling it at thy face,	999
	Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,	999
	This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair	999
	Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,	999
	Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,	999
	'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'	999
	999
	[Enter OXFORD, with drum and colours]	999
	999
WARWICK	O cheerful colours! see where Oxford comes!	999
	999
OXFORD	Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!	999
	999
	[He and his forces enter the city]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	The gates are open, let us enter too.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	So other foes may set upon our backs.	999
	Stand we in good array; for they no doubt	999
	Will issue out again and bid us battle:	999
	If not, the city being but of small defence,	999
	We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.	999
	999
WARWICK	O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.	999
	999
	[Enter MONTAGUE with drum and colours]	999
	999
MONTAGUE	Montague, Montague, for Lancaster!	999
	999
	[He and his forces enter the city]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason	999
	Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	The harder match'd, the greater victory:	999
	My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.	999
	999

	And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.	999
	999
	[Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours]	999
	999
WARWICK	And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,	999
	Of force enough to bid his brother battle;	999
	With whom an upright zeal to right prevails	999
	More than the nature of a brother's love!	999
	Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Father of Warwick, know you what this means?	999
	999
	[Taking his red rose out of his hat]	999
	999
	Look here, I throw my infamy at thee	999
	I will not ruinate my father's house,	999
	Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,	999
	And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,	999
	That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,	999
	To bend the fatal instruments of war	999
	Against his brother and his lawful king?	999
	Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:	999
	To keep that oath were more impiety	999
	Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.	999
	I am so sorry for my trespass made	999
	That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,	999
	I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,	999
	With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--	999
	As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--	999
	To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.	999
	And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,	999
	And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.	999
	Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:	999
	And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,	999
	For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,	999
	Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.	999
	999
WARWICK	O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?	999
	Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?	999
	999
WARWICK	Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!	999
	I will away towards Barnet presently,	999
	And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Yes, Warwick, Edward dares, and leads the way.	999

	Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,	999
	My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.	999
	That I must yield my body to the earth	999
	And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.	999
	Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,	999
	Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,	999
	Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,	999
	Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree	999
	And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.	999
	These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,	999
	Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,	999
	To search the secret treasons of the world:	999
	The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,	999
	Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;	999
	For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?	999
	And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?	999
	Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!	999
	My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.	999
	Even now forsake me, and of all my lands	999
	Is nothing left me but my body's length.	999
	Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?	999
	And, live we how we can, yet die we must.	999
	999
	[Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET]	999
	999
SOMERSET	Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.	999
	We might recover all our loss again;	999
	The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:	999
	Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!	999
	999
WARWICK	Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,	999
	If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.	999
	And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!	999
	Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,	999
	Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood	999
	That glues my lips and will not let me speak.	999
	Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.	999
	999
SOMERSET	Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;	999
	And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,	999
	And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'	999
	And more he would have said, and more he spoke,	999
	Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,	999
	That mought not be distinguished; but at last	999
	I well might hear, delivered with a groan,	999
	'O, farewell, Warwick!'	999
	999
WARWICK	Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;	999
	For Warwick bids you all farewell to meet in heaven.	999

	999
KING EDWARD IV	Thus far our fortune keeps an upward course,	999
	And we are graced with wreaths of victory.	999
	But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,	999
	I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,	999
	That will encounter with our glorious sun,	999
	Ere he attain his easeful western bed:	999
	I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen	999
	Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast	999
	And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.	999
	999
CLARENCE	A little gale will soon disperse that cloud	999
	And blow it to the source from whence it came:	999
	The very beams will dry those vapours up,	999
	For every cloud engenders not a storm.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,	999
	And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her:	999
	If she have time to breathe be well assured	999
	Her faction will be full as strong as ours.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	We are advertised by our loving friends	999
	That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:	999
	We, having now the best at Barnet field,	999
	Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;	999

	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,	999
	But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.	999
	What though the mast be now blown overboard,	999
	The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,	999
	And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?	999
	Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he	999
	Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad	999
	With tearful eyes add water to the sea	999
	And give more strength to that which hath too much,	999
	Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,	999
	Which industry and courage might have saved?	999
	Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!	999
	Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?	999
	And Montague our topmost; what of him?	999
	Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?	999
	Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?	999
	And Somerset another goodly mast?	999
	The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?	999
	And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I	999
	For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?	999
	We will not from the helm to sit and weep,	999
	But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,	999
	From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.	999
	As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.	999
	And what is Edward but ruthless sea?	999
	What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?	999
	And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?	999
	All these the enemies to our poor bark.	999
	Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!	999
	Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:	999
	Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,	999
	Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.	999
	This speak I, lords, to let you understand,	999
	If case some one of you would fly from us,	999
	That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers	999
	More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.	999
	Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided	999
	'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit	999
	Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,	999
	Infuse his breast with magnanimity	999
	And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.	999
	I speak not this as doubting any here	999
	For did I but suspect a fearful man	999
	He should have leave to go away betimes,	999
	Lest in our need he might infect another	999
	And make him of like spirit to himself.	999
	If any such be here--as God forbid!--	999
	Let him depart before we need his help.	999
	999
OXFORD	Women and children of so high a courage,	999
	And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.	999
	O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather	999
	Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live	999
	To bear his image and renew his glories!	999
	999
SOMERSET	And he that will not fight for such a hope.	999
	Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,	999
	If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.	999

	To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.	999

	Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,	999
	Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.	999
	I need not add more fuel to your fire,	999
	For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out	999
	Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say	999
	My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,	999
	Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes.	999
	Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,	999
	Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,	999
	His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,	999
	His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;	999
	And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.	999
	You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,	999

	What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?	999
	Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make	999
	For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,	999
	And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!	999
	Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;	999
	Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,	999
	Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,	999
	Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	That you might still have worn the petticoat,	999
	And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;	999
	His currish riddles sort not with this place.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	For God's sake, take away this captive scold.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	I know my duty; you are all undutiful:	999
	Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,	999
	And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all	999
	I am your better, traitors as ye are:	999
	And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.	999

	999
KING EDWARD IV	What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.	999

QUEEN MARGARET	O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!	999
	Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!	999
	They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,	999
	Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,	999
	If this foul deed were by to equal it:	999
	He was a man; this, in respect, a child:	999
	And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.	999
	What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?	999
	No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:	999
	And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.	999
	Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!	999
	How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!	999
	You have no children, butchers! if you had,	999
	The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:	999
	But if you ever chance to have a child,	999
	Look in his youth to have him so cut off	999
	As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,	999
	Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death:	999
	What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou.	999
	999
CLARENCE	By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:	999
	'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.	999
	What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,	999
	Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?	999
	Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;	999
	Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.	999
	999

KING EDWARD IV	He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.	999
	Now march we hence: discharge the common sort	999
	With pay and thanks, and let's away to London	999

	999
GLOUCESTER	Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather;	999
	'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:	999
	'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,	999
	And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.	999
	999
	[Exit Lieutenant]	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;	999
	So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece	999
	And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.	999
	What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;	999
	The thief doth fear each bush an officer.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	The bird that hath been limed in a bush,	999
	With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;	999
	And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,	999
	Have now the fatal object in my eye	999
	Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,	999
	That taught his son the office of a fowl!	999
	An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;	999
	Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;	999
	The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy	999
	Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea	999
	Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.	999
	Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!	999
	My breast can better brook thy dagger's point	999
	Than can my ears that tragic history.	999
	But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Think'st thou I am an executioner?	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:	999
	If murdering innocents be executing,	999
	Why, then thou art an executioner.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,	999
	Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.	999
	And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,	999
	Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,	999
	And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,	999
	And many an orphan's water-standing eye--	999
	Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,	999
	And orphans for their parents timeless death--	999
	Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.	999
	The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;	999
	The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;	999
	Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;	999
	The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,	999
	And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.	999
	Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,	999
	And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,	999
	To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,	999
	Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.	999
	Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,	999
	To signify thou camest to bite the world:	999
	And, if the rest be true which I have heard,	999
	Thou camest--	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:	999
	999
	[Stabs him]	999
	999
	For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.	999
	999
KING HENRY VI	Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.	999
	God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster	999
	Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.	999
	See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!	999
	O, may such purple tears be alway shed	999
	From those that wish the downfall of our house!	999
	If any spark of life be yet remaining,	999
	Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:	999
	999
	[Stabs him again]	999
	999
	I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.	999
	Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;	999
	For I have often heard my mother say	999
	I came into the world with my legs forward:	999
	Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,	999
	And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?	999
	The midwife wonder'd and the women cried	999
	'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'	999
	And so I was; which plainly signified	999
	That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.	999
	Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,	999
	Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.	999
	I have no brother, I am like no brother;	999
	And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,	999
	Be resident in men like one another	999
	And not in me: I am myself alone.	999
	Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:	999
	But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;	999
	For I will buz abroad such prophecies	999
	That Edward shall be fearful of his life,	999
	And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.	999
	King Henry and the prince his son are gone:	999
	Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,	999
	Counting myself but bad till I be best.	999
	I'll throw thy body in another room	999

	999
KING EDWARD IV	Once more we sit in England's royal throne,	999
	Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.	999
	What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,	999
	Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!	999
	Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd	999
	For hardy and undoubted champions;	999
	Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,	999
	And two Northumberlands; two braver men	999
	Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;	999
	With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,	999
	That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion	999
	And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.	999
	Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat	999
	And made our footstool of security.	999
	Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.	999
	Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself	999
	Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,	999
	Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,	999
	That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;	999
	And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  I'll blast his harvest, if your head were laid;	999
	For yet I am not look'd on in the world.	999
	This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave;	999
	And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:	999
	Work thou the way,--and thou shalt execute.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;	999
	And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.	999
	999
CLARENCE	The duty that I owe unto your majesty	999
	I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,	999
	Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.	999
	[Aside]  To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master,	999
	And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Now am I seated as my soul delights,	999
	Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.	999
	999
CLARENCE	What will your grace have done with Margaret?	999
	Reignier, her father, to the king of France	999
	Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,	999
	And hither have they sent it for her ransom.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Away with her, and waft her hence to France.	999
	And now what rests but that we spend the time	999
	With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,	999
	Such as befits the pleasure of the court?	999
	Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!	999
	For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.	999

	PROLOGUE	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Chorus]	999
	999
Chorus	O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend	999
	The brightest heaven of invention,	999
	A kingdom for a stage, princes to act	999
	And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!	999
	Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,	999
	Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,	999
	Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire	999
	Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,	999
	The flat unraised spirits that have dared	999
	On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth	999
	So great an object: can this cockpit hold	999
	The vasty fields of France? or may we cram	999
	Within this wooden O the very casques	999
	That did affright the air at Agincourt?	999
	O, pardon! since a crooked figure may	999
	Attest in little place a million;	999
	And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,	999
	On your imaginary forces work.	999
	Suppose within the girdle of these walls	999
	Are now confined two mighty monarchies,	999
	Whose high upreared and abutting fronts	999
	The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:	999
	Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;	999
	Into a thousand parts divide on man,	999
	And make imaginary puissance;	999
	Think when we talk of horses, that you see them	999
	Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;	999
	For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,	999
	Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,	999
	Turning the accomplishment of many years	999
	Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,	999
	Admit me Chorus to this history;	999
	Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,	999
	Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.	999

ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY]	999
	999
CANTERBURY	My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,	999
	Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign	999
	Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,	999
	But that the scambling and unquiet time	999
	Did push it out of farther question.	999
	999
ELY	But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?	999
	999
CANTERBURY	It must be thought on. If it pass against us,	999
	We lose the better half of our possession:	999
	For all the temporal lands which men devout	999
	By testament have given to the church	999
	Would they strip from us; being valued thus:	999
	As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,	999
	Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,	999
	Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;	999
	And, to relief of lazars and weak age,	999
	Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.	999
	A hundred almshouses right well supplied;	999
	And to the coffers of the king beside,	999
	A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.	999
	999
ELY	This would drink deep.	999
	999
CANTERBURY	'Twould drink the cup and all.	999
	999
ELY	But what prevention?	999
	999
CANTERBURY	The king is full of grace and fair regard.	999
	999
ELY	And a true lover of the holy church.	999
	999
CANTERBURY	The courses of his youth promised it not.	999
	The breath no sooner left his father's body,	999
	But that his wildness, mortified in him,	999
	Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment	999
	Consideration, like an angel, came	999
	And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,	999
	Leaving his body as a paradise,	999
	To envelop and contain celestial spirits.	999
	Never was such a sudden scholar made;	999
	Never came reformation in a flood,	999
	With such a heady currance, scouring faults	999
	Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness	999
	So soon did lose his seat and all at once	999
	As in this king.	999
	999
ELY	                  We are blessed in the change.	999
	999
CANTERBURY	Hear him but reason in divinity,	999
	And all-admiring with an inward wish	999
	You would desire the king were made a prelate:	999
	Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,	999
	You would say it hath been all in all his study:	999
	List his discourse of war, and you shall hear	999
	A fearful battle render'd you in music:	999
	Turn him to any cause of policy,	999
	The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,	999
	Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,	999
	The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,	999
	And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,	999
	To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;	999
	So that the art and practic part of life	999
	Must be the mistress to this theoric:	999
	Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,	999
	Since his addiction was to courses vain,	999
	His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,	999
	His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,	999
	And never noted in him any study,	999
	Any retirement, any sequestration	999
	From open haunts and popularity.	999
	999
ELY	The strawberry grows underneath the nettle	999
	And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best	999
	Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:	999
	And so the prince obscured his contemplation	999
	Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,	999
	Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,	999
	Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.	999
	999
CANTERBURY	It must be so; for miracles are ceased;	999
	And therefore we must needs admit the means	999
	How things are perfected.	999
	999
ELY	But, my good lord,	999
	How now for mitigation of this bill	999
	Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty	999
	Incline to it, or no?	999
	999
CANTERBURY	He seems indifferent,	999
	Or rather swaying more upon our part	999
	Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;	999
	For I have made an offer to his majesty,	999
	Upon our spiritual convocation	999
	And in regard of causes now in hand,	999
	Which I have open'd to his grace at large,	999
	As touching France, to give a greater sum	999
	Than ever at one time the clergy yet	999
	Did to his predecessors part withal.	999
	999
ELY	How did this offer seem received, my lord?	999
	999
CANTERBURY	With good acceptance of his majesty;	999
	Save that there was not time enough to hear,	999
	As I perceived his grace would fain have done,	999
	The severals and unhidden passages	999
	Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms	999
	And generally to the crown and seat of France	999
	Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.	999
	999
ELY	What was the impediment that broke this off?	999
	999
CANTERBURY	The French ambassador upon that instant	999
	Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come	999
	To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?	999
	999
ELY	It is.	999
	999
CANTERBURY	Then go we in, to know his embassy;	999
	Which I could with a ready guess declare,	999
	Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.	999
	999
ELY	I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.	999

KING HENRY V	Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?	999
	999
EXETER	Not here in presence.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Send for him, good uncle.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,	999
	Before we hear him, of some things of weight	999
	That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.	999
	999
	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY]	999
	999
CANTERBURY	God and his angels guard your sacred throne	999
	And make you long become it!	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Sure, we thank you.	999
	My learned lord, we pray you to proceed	999
	And justly and religiously unfold	999
	Why the law Salique that they have in France	999
	Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:	999
	And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,	999
	That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,	999
	Or nicely charge your understanding soul	999
	With opening titles miscreate, whose right	999
	Suits not in native colours with the truth;	999
	For God doth know how many now in health	999
	Shall drop their blood in approbation	999
	Of what your reverence shall incite us to.	999
	Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,	999
	How you awake our sleeping sword of war:	999
	We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;	999
	For never two such kingdoms did contend	999
	Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops	999
	Are every one a woe, a sore complaint	999
	'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords	999
	That make such waste in brief mortality.	999
	Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;	999
	For we will hear, note and believe in heart	999
	That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd	999
	As pure as sin with baptism.	999
	999
CANTERBURY	Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,	999
	That owe yourselves, your lives and services	999
	To this imperial throne. There is no bar	999
	To make against your highness' claim to France	999
	But this, which they produce from Pharamond,	999
	'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'	999
	'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'	999
	Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze	999
	To be the realm of France, and Pharamond	999
	The founder of this law and female bar.	999
	Yet their own authors faithfully affirm	999
	That the land Salique is in Germany,	999
	Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;	999
	Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,	999
	There left behind and settled certain French;	999
	Who, holding in disdain the German women	999
	For some dishonest manners of their life,	999
	Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female	999
	Should be inheritrix in Salique land:	999
	Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,	999
	Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.	999
	Then doth it well appear that Salique law	999
	Was not devised for the realm of France:	999
	Nor did the French possess the Salique land	999
	Until four hundred one and twenty years	999
	After defunction of King Pharamond,	999
	Idly supposed the founder of this law;	999
	Who died within the year of our redemption	999
	Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great	999
	Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French	999
	Beyond the river Sala, in the year	999
	Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,	999
	King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,	999
	Did, as heir general, being descended	999
	Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,	999
	Make claim and title to the crown of France.	999
	Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown	999
	Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male	999
	Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,	999
	To find his title with some shows of truth,	999
	'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,	999
	Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,	999
	Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son	999
	To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son	999
	Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,	999
	Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,	999
	Could not keep quiet in his conscience,	999
	Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied	999
	That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,	999
	Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,	999
	Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:	999
	By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great	999
	Was re-united to the crown of France.	999
	So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.	999
	King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,	999
	King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear	999
	To hold in right and title of the female:	999
	So do the kings of France unto this day;	999
	Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law	999
	To bar your highness claiming from the female,	999
	And rather choose to hide them in a net	999
	Than amply to imbar their crooked titles	999
	Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	May I with right and conscience make this claim?	999
	999
CANTERBURY	The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!	999
	For in the book of Numbers is it writ,	999
	When the man dies, let the inheritance	999
	Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,	999
	Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;	999
	Look back into your mighty ancestors:	999
	Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,	999
	From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,	999
	And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,	999
	Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,	999
	Making defeat on the full power of France,	999
	Whiles his most mighty father on a hill	999
	Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp	999
	Forage in blood of French nobility.	999
	O noble English. that could entertain	999
	With half their forces the full Pride of France	999
	And let another half stand laughing by,	999
	All out of work and cold for action!	999
	999
ELY	Awake remembrance of these valiant dead	999
	And with your puissant arm renew their feats:	999
	You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;	999
	The blood and courage that renowned them	999
	Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege	999
	Is in the very May-morn of his youth,	999
	Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.	999
	999
EXETER	Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth	999
	Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,	999
	As did the former lions of your blood.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	They know your grace hath cause and means and might;	999
	So hath your highness; never king of England	999
	Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,	999
	Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England	999
	And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.	999
	999
CANTERBURY	O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,	999
	With blood and sword and fire to win your right;	999
	In aid whereof we of the spiritualty	999
	Will raise your highness such a mighty sum	999
	As never did the clergy at one time	999
	Bring in to any of your ancestors.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	We must not only arm to invade the French,	999
	But lay down our proportions to defend	999
	Against the Scot, who will make road upon us	999
	With all advantages.	999
	999
CANTERBURY	They of those marches, gracious sovereign,	999
	Shall be a wall sufficient to defend	999
	Our inland from the pilfering borderers.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,	999
	But fear the main intendment of the Scot,	999
	Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;	999
	For you shall read that my great-grandfather	999
	Never went with his forces into France	999
	But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom	999
	Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,	999
	With ample and brim fulness of his force,	999
	Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,	999
	Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;	999
	That England, being empty of defence,	999
	Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.	999
	999
CANTERBURY	She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;	999
	For hear her but exampled by herself:	999
	When all her chivalry hath been in France	999
	And she a mourning widow of her nobles,	999
	She hath herself not only well defended	999
	But taken and impounded as a stray	999
	The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,	999
	To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings	999
	And make her chronicle as rich with praise	999
	As is the ooze and bottom of the sea	999
	With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	But there's a saying very old and true,	999
	'If that you will France win,	999
	Then with Scotland first begin:'	999
	For once the eagle England being in prey,	999
	To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot	999
	Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,	999
	Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,	999
	To tear and havoc more than she can eat.	999
	999
EXETER	It follows then the cat must stay at home:	999
	Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,	999
	Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,	999
	And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.	999
	While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,	999
	The advised head defends itself at home;	999
	For government, though high and low and lower,	999
	Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,	999
	Congreeing in a full and natural close,	999
	Like music.	999
	999
CANTERBURY	          Therefore doth heaven divide	999
	The state of man in divers functions,	999
	Setting endeavour in continual motion;	999
	To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,	999
	Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,	999
	Creatures that by a rule in nature teach	999
	The act of order to a peopled kingdom.	999
	They have a king and officers of sorts;	999
	Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,	999
	Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,	999
	Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,	999
	Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,	999
	Which pillage they with merry march bring home	999
	To the tent-royal of their emperor;	999
	Who, busied in his majesty, surveys	999
	The singing masons building roofs of gold,	999
	The civil citizens kneading up the honey,	999
	The poor mechanic porters crowding in	999
	Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,	999
	The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,	999
	Delivering o'er to executors pale	999
	The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,	999
	That many things, having full reference	999
	To one consent, may work contrariously:	999
	As many arrows, loosed several ways,	999
	Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;	999
	As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;	999
	As many lines close in the dial's centre;	999
	So may a thousand actions, once afoot.	999
	End in one purpose, and be all well borne	999
	Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.	999
	Divide your happy England into four;	999
	Whereof take you one quarter into France,	999
	And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.	999
	If we, with thrice such powers left at home,	999
	Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,	999
	Let us be worried and our nation lose	999
	The name of hardiness and policy.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.	999
	999
	[Exeunt some Attendants]	999
	999
	Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,	999
	And yours, the noble sinews of our power,	999
	France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,	999
	Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,	999
	Ruling in large and ample empery	999
	O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,	999
	Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,	999
	Tombless, with no remembrance over them:	999
	Either our history shall with full mouth	999
	Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,	999
	Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,	999
	Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.	999
	999
	[Enter Ambassadors of France]	999
	999
	Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure	999
	Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear	999
	Your greeting is from him, not from the king.	999
	999
First Ambassador	May't please your majesty to give us leave	999
	Freely to render what we have in charge;	999
	Or shall we sparingly show you far off	999
	The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;	999
	Unto whose grace our passion is as subject	999
	As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:	999
	Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness	999
	Tell us the Dauphin's mind.	999
	999
First Ambassador	Thus, then, in few.	999
	Your highness, lately sending into France,	999
	Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right	999
	Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.	999
	In answer of which claim, the prince our master	999
	Says that you savour too much of your youth,	999
	And bids you be advised there's nought in France	999
	That can be with a nimble galliard won;	999
	You cannot revel into dukedoms there.	999
	He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,	999
	This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,	999
	Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim	999
	Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	What treasure, uncle?	999
	999
EXETER	Tennis-balls, my liege.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;	999
	His present and your pains we thank you for:	999
	When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,	999
	We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set	999
	Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.	999
	Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler	999
	That all the courts of France will be disturb'd	999
	With chaces. And we understand him well,	999
	How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,	999
	Not measuring what use we made of them.	999
	We never valued this poor seat of England;	999
	And therefore, living hence, did give ourself	999
	To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common	999
	That men are merriest when they are from home.	999
	But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,	999
	Be like a king and show my sail of greatness	999
	When I do rouse me in my throne of France:	999
	For that I have laid by my majesty	999
	And plodded like a man for working-days,	999
	But I will rise there with so full a glory	999
	That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,	999
	Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.	999
	And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his	999
	Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul	999
	Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance	999
	That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows	999
	Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;	999
	Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;	999
	And some are yet ungotten and unborn	999
	That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.	999
	But this lies all within the will of God,	999
	To whom I do appeal; and in whose name	999
	Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,	999
	To venge me as I may and to put forth	999
	My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.	999
	So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin	999
	His jest will savour but of shallow wit,	999
	When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.	999
	Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Ambassadors]	999
	999
EXETER	This was a merry message.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	We hope to make the sender blush at it.	999
	Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour	999
	That may give furtherance to our expedition;	999
	For we have now no thought in us but France,	999
	Save those to God, that run before our business.	999
	Therefore let our proportions for these wars	999
	Be soon collected and all things thought upon	999
	That may with reasonable swiftness add	999
	More feathers to our wings; for, God before,	999
	We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.	999
	Therefore let every man now task his thought,	999
	That this fair action may on foot be brought.	999

	999
	PROLOGUE	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Chorus]	999
	999
Chorus	Now all the youth of England are on fire,	999
	And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:	999
	Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought	999
	Reigns solely in the breast of every man:	999
	They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,	999
	Following the mirror of all Christian kings,	999
	With winged heels, as English Mercuries.	999
	For now sits Expectation in the air,	999
	And hides a sword from hilts unto the point	999
	With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,	999
	Promised to Harry and his followers.	999
	The French, advised by good intelligence	999
	Of this most dreadful preparation,	999
	Shake in their fear and with pale policy	999
	Seek to divert the English purposes.	999
	O England! model to thy inward greatness,	999
	Like little body with a mighty heart,	999
	What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,	999
	Were all thy children kind and natural!	999
	But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out	999
	A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills	999
	With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,	999
	One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,	999
	Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,	999
	Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,	999
	Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!	999
	Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;	999
	And by their hands this grace of kings must die,	999
	If hell and treason hold their promises,	999
	Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.	999
	Linger your patience on; and we'll digest	999
	The abuse of distance; force a play:	999
	The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;	999
	The king is set from London; and the scene	999
	Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;	999
	There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:	999
	And thence to France shall we convey you safe,	999
	And bring you back, charming the narrow seas	999
	To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,	999
	We'll not offend one stomach with our play.	999
	But, till the king come forth, and not till then,	999
	Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.	999

ACT II	999

	999
SCENE I	London. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH]	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Well met, Corporal Nym.	999
	999
NYM	Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?	999
	999
NYM	For my part, I care not: I say little; but when	999
	time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that	999
	shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will	999
	wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but	999
	what though? it will toast cheese, and it will	999
	endure cold as another man's sword will: and	999
	there's an end.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and	999
	we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it	999
	be so, good Corporal Nym.	999
	999
NYM	Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the	999
	certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I	999
	will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the	999
	rendezvous of it.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell	999
	Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you	999
	were troth-plight to her.	999
	999
NYM	I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may	999
	sleep, and they may have their throats about them at	999
	that time; and some say knives have edges. It must	999
	be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet	999
	she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I	999
	cannot tell.	999
	999
	[Enter PISTOL and Hostess]	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good	999
	corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!	999
	999
PISTOL	Base tike, call'st thou me host? Now, by this hand,	999
	I swear, I scorn the term; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.	999
	999
Hostess	No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and	999
	board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live	999
	honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will	999
	be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.	999
	999
	[NYM and PISTOL draw]	999
	999
	O well a day, Lady, if he be not drawn now! we	999
	shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.	999
	999
NYM	Pish!	999
	999
PISTOL	Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland!	999
	999
Hostess	Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.	999
	999
NYM	Will you shog off? I would have you solus.	999
	999
PISTOL	'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!	999
	The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;	999
	The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,	999
	And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,	999
	And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!	999
	I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;	999
	For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,	999
	And flashing fire will follow.	999
	999
NYM	I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an	999
	humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow	999
	foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my	999
	rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk	999
	off, I would prick your guts a little, in good	999
	terms, as I may: and that's the humour of it.	999
	999
PISTOL	O braggart vile and damned furious wight!	999
	The grave doth gape, and doting death is near;	999
	Therefore exhale.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the	999
	first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.	999
	999
	[Draws]	999
	999
PISTOL	An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.	999
	Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:	999
	Thy spirits are most tall.	999
	999
NYM	I will cut thy throat, one time or other, in fair	999
	terms: that is the humour of it.	999
	999
PISTOL	'Couple a gorge!'	999
	That is the word. I thee defy again.	999
	O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?	999
	No; to the spital go,	999
	And from the powdering tub of infamy	999
	Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,	999
	Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:	999
	I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly	999
	For the only she; and--pauca, there's enough. Go to.	999
	999
	[Enter the Boy]	999
	999
Boy	Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master, and	999
	you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed.	999
	Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and	999
	do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he's very ill.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Away, you rogue!	999
	999
Hostess	By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of	999
	these days. The king has killed his heart. Good	999
	husband, come home presently.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Hostess and Boy]	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to	999
	France together: why the devil should we keep	999
	knives to cut one another's throats?	999
	999
PISTOL	Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!	999
	999
NYM	You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?	999
	999
PISTOL	Base is the slave that pays.	999
	999
NYM	That now I will have: that's the humour of it.	999
	999
PISTOL	As manhood shall compound: push home.	999
	999
	[They draw]	999
	999
BARDOLPH	By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll	999
	kill him; by this sword, I will.	999
	999
PISTOL	Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends:	999
	an thou wilt not, why, then, be enemies with me too.	999
	Prithee, put up.	999
	999
NYM	I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?	999
	999
PISTOL	A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;	999
	And liquor likewise will I give to thee,	999
	And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood:	999
	I'll live by Nym, and Nym shall live by me;	999
	Is not this just? for I shall sutler be	999
	Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.	999
	Give me thy hand.	999
	999
NYM	I shall have my noble?	999
	999
PISTOL	In cash most justly paid.	999
	999
NYM	Well, then, that's the humour of't.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Hostess]	999
	999
Hostess	As ever you came of women, come in quickly to Sir	999
	John. Ah, poor heart! he is so shaked of a burning	999
	quotidian tertian, that it is most lamentable to	999
	behold. Sweet men, come to him.	999
	999
NYM	The king hath run bad humours on the knight; that's	999
	the even of it.	999
	999
PISTOL	Nym, thou hast spoke the right;	999
	His heart is fracted and corroborate.	999
	999
NYM	The king is a good king: but it must be as it may;	999
	he passes some humours and careers.	999
	999
PISTOL	Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins we will live.	999

	[Enter EXETER, BEDFORD, and WESTMORELAND]	999
	999
BEDFORD	'Fore God, his grace is bold, to trust these traitors.	999
	999
EXETER	They shall be apprehended by and by.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	How smooth and even they do bear themselves!	999
	As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,	999
	Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.	999
	999
BEDFORD	The king hath note of all that they intend,	999
	By interception which they dream not of.	999
	999
EXETER	Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,	999
	Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,	999
	That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell	999
	His sovereign's life to death and treachery.	999
	999
	[Trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY V, SCROOP,	999
	CAMBRIDGE, GREY, and Attendants]	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.	999
	My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,	999
	And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:	999
	Think you not that the powers we bear with us	999
	Will cut their passage through the force of France,	999
	Doing the execution and the act	999
	For which we have in head assembled them?	999
	999
SCROOP	No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded	999
	We carry not a heart with us from hence	999
	That grows not in a fair consent with ours,	999
	Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish	999
	Success and conquest to attend on us.	999
	999
CAMBRIDGE	Never was monarch better fear'd and loved	999
	Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject	999
	That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness	999
	Under the sweet shade of your government.	999
	999
GREY	True: those that were your father's enemies	999
	Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you	999
	With hearts create of duty and of zeal.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;	999
	And shall forget the office of our hand,	999
	Sooner than quittance of desert and merit	999
	According to the weight and worthiness.	999
	999
SCROOP	So service shall with steeled sinews toil,	999
	And labour shall refresh itself with hope,	999
	To do your grace incessant services.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,	999
	Enlarge the man committed yesterday,	999
	That rail'd against our person: we consider	999
	it was excess of wine that set him on;	999
	And on his more advice we pardon him.	999
	999
SCROOP	That's mercy, but too much security:	999
	Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example	999
	Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	O, let us yet be merciful.	999
	999
CAMBRIDGE	So may your highness, and yet punish too.	999
	999
GREY	Sir,	999
	You show great mercy, if you give him life,	999
	After the taste of much correction.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Alas, your too much love and care of me	999
	Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!	999
	If little faults, proceeding on distemper,	999
	Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye	999
	When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,	999
	Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,	999
	Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care	999
	And tender preservation of our person,	999
	Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:	999
	Who are the late commissioners?	999
	999
CAMBRIDGE	I one, my lord:	999
	Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.	999
	999
SCROOP	So did you me, my liege.	999
	999
GREY	And I, my royal sovereign.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;	999
	There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,	999
	Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:	999
	Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.	999
	My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,	999
	We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!	999
	What see you in those papers that you lose	999
	So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!	999
	Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there	999
	That hath so cowarded and chased your blood	999
	Out of appearance?	999
	999
CAMBRIDGE	                  I do confess my fault;	999
	And do submit me to your highness' mercy.	999
	999
	999
GREY	|	999
	|  To which we all appeal.	999
SCROOP	|	999
	999
	999
KING HENRY V	The mercy that was quick in us but late,	999
	By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:	999
	You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;	999
	For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,	999
	As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.	999
	See you, my princes, and my noble peers,	999
	These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,	999
	You know how apt our love was to accord	999
	To furnish him with all appertinents	999
	Belonging to his honour; and this man	999
	Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,	999
	And sworn unto the practises of France,	999
	To kill us here in Hampton: to the which	999
	This knight, no less for bounty bound to us	999
	Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,	999
	What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,	999
	Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!	999
	Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,	999
	That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,	999
	That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,	999
	Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,	999
	May it be possible, that foreign hire	999
	Could out of thee extract one spark of evil	999
	That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,	999
	That, though the truth of it stands off as gross	999
	As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.	999
	Treason and murder ever kept together,	999
	As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,	999
	Working so grossly in a natural cause,	999
	That admiration did not whoop at them:	999
	But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in	999
	Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:	999
	And whatsoever cunning fiend it was	999
	That wrought upon thee so preposterously	999
	Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:	999
	All other devils that suggest by treasons	999
	Do botch and bungle up damnation	999
	With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd	999
	From glistering semblances of piety;	999
	But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,	999
	Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,	999
	Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.	999
	If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus	999
	Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,	999
	He might return to vasty Tartar back,	999
	And tell the legions 'I can never win	999
	A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'	999
	O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infected	999
	The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?	999
	Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?	999
	Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?	999
	Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?	999
	Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,	999
	Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,	999
	Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,	999
	Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,	999
	Not working with the eye without the ear,	999
	And but in purged judgment trusting neither?	999
	Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:	999
	And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,	999
	To mark the full-fraught man and best indued	999
	With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;	999
	For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like	999
	Another fall of man. Their faults are open:	999
	Arrest them to the answer of the law;	999
	And God acquit them of their practises!	999
	999
EXETER	   I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of	999
	Richard Earl of Cambridge.	999
	I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of	999
	Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.	999
	I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of	999
	Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.	999
	999
SCROOP	Our purposes God justly hath discover'd;	999
	And I repent my fault more than my death;	999
	Which I beseech your highness to forgive,	999
	Although my body pay the price of it.	999
	999
CAMBRIDGE	For me, the gold of France did not seduce;	999
	Although I did admit it as a motive	999
	The sooner to effect what I intended:	999
	But God be thanked for prevention;	999
	Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,	999
	Beseeching God and you to pardon me.	999
	999
GREY	Never did faithful subject more rejoice	999
	At the discovery of most dangerous treason	999
	Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself.	999
	Prevented from a damned enterprise:	999
	My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.	999
	You have conspired against our royal person,	999
	Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers	999
	Received the golden earnest of our death;	999
	Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,	999
	His princes and his peers to servitude,	999
	His subjects to oppression and contempt	999
	And his whole kingdom into desolation.	999
	Touching our person seek we no revenge;	999
	But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,	999
	Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws	999
	We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,	999
	Poor miserable wretches, to your death:	999
	The taste whereof, God of his mercy give	999
	You patience to endure, and true repentance	999
	Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.	999
	999
	[Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP and GREY, guarded]	999
	999
	Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof	999
	Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.	999
	We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,	999
	Since God so graciously hath brought to light	999
	This dangerous treason lurking in our way	999
	To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now	999
	But every rub is smoothed on our way.	999
	Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver	999
	Our puissance into the hand of God,	999
	Putting it straight in expedition.	999
	Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:	999
	No king of England, if not king of France.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter PISTOL, Hostess, NYM, BARDOLPH, and Boy]	999
	999
Hostess	Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines.	999
	999
PISTOL	No; for my manly heart doth yearn.	999
	Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins:	999
	Boy, bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is dead,	999
	And we must yearn therefore.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in	999
	heaven or in hell!	999
	999
Hostess	Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's	999
	bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' made	999
	a finer end and went away an it had been any	999
	christom child; a' parted even just between twelve	999
	and one, even at the turning o' the tide: for after	999
	I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with	999
	flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knew	999
	there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as	999
	a pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,	999
	sir John!' quoth I	'what, man! be o' good	999
	cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or	999
	four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'	999
	should not think of God; I hoped there was no need	999
	to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So	999
	a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my	999
	hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as	999
	cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and	999
	they were as cold as any stone, and so upward and	999
	upward, and all was as cold as any stone.	999
	999
NYM	They say he cried out of sack.	999
	999
Hostess	Ay, that a' did.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	And of women.	999
	999
Hostess	Nay, that a' did not.	999
	999
Boy	Yes, that a' did; and said they were devils	999
	incarnate.	999
	999
Hostess	A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he	999
	never liked.	999
	999
Boy	A' said once, the devil would have him about women.	999
	999
Hostess	A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then	999
	he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.	999
	999
Boy	Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon	999
	Bardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soul	999
	burning in hell-fire?	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:	999
	that's all the riches I got in his service.	999
	999
NYM	Shall we shog? the king will be gone from	999
	Southampton.	999
	999
PISTOL	Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.	999
	Look to my chattels and my movables:	999
	Let senses rule; the word is 'Pitch and Pay:'	999
	Trust none;	999
	For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,	999
	And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:	999
	Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.	999
	Go, clear thy crystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,	999
	Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys,	999
	To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!	999
	999
Boy	And that's but unwholesome food they say.	999
	999
PISTOL	Touch her soft mouth, and march.	999
	999
BARDOLPH	Farewell, hostess.	999
	999
	[Kissing her]	999
	999
NYM	I cannot kiss, that is the humour of it; but, adieu.	999

SCENE IV	France. The KING'S palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter the FRENCH KING, the DAUPHIN, the	999
	DUKES of BERRI and BRETAGNE, the Constable, and others]	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	Thus comes the English with full power upon us;	999
	And more than carefully it us concerns	999
	To answer royally in our defences.	999
	Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,	999
	Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,	999
	And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,	999
	To line and new repair our towns of war	999
	With men of courage and with means defendant;	999
	For England his approaches makes as fierce	999
	As waters to the sucking of a gulf.	999
	It fits us then to be as provident	999
	As fear may teach us out of late examples	999
	Left by the fatal and neglected English	999
	Upon our fields.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	                  My most redoubted father,	999
	It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;	999
	For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,	999
	Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,	999
	But that defences, musters, preparations,	999
	Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,	999
	As were a war in expectation.	999
	Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth	999
	To view the sick and feeble parts of France:	999
	And let us do it with no show of fear;	999
	No, with no more than if we heard that England	999
	Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:	999
	For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,	999
	Her sceptre so fantastically borne	999
	By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,	999
	That fear attends her not.	999
	999
Constable	O peace, Prince Dauphin!	999
	You are too much mistaken in this king:	999
	Question your grace the late ambassadors,	999
	With what great state he heard their embassy,	999
	How well supplied with noble counsellors,	999
	How modest in exception, and withal	999
	How terrible in constant resolution,	999
	And you shall find his vanities forespent	999
	Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,	999
	Covering discretion with a coat of folly;	999
	As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots	999
	That shall first spring and be most delicate.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;	999
	But though we think it so, it is no matter:	999
	In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh	999
	The enemy more mighty than he seems:	999
	So the proportions of defence are fill'd;	999
	Which of a weak or niggardly projection	999
	Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting	999
	A little cloth.	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	                  Think we King Harry strong;	999
	And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.	999
	The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;	999
	And he is bred out of that bloody strain	999
	That haunted us in our familiar paths:	999
	Witness our too much memorable shame	999
	When Cressy battle fatally was struck,	999
	And all our princes captiv'd by the hand	999
	Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;	999
	Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,	999
	Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,	999
	Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,	999
	Mangle the work of nature and deface	999
	The patterns that by God and by French fathers	999
	Had twenty years been made. This is a stem	999
	Of that victorious stock; and let us fear	999
	The native mightiness and fate of him.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	Ambassadors from Harry King of England	999
	Do crave admittance to your majesty.	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	We'll give them present audience. Go, and bring them.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords]	999
	999
	You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs	999
	Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten	999
	Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,	999
	Take up the English short, and let them know	999
	Of what a monarchy you are the head:	999
	Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin	999
	As self-neglecting.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Lords, with EXETER and train]	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	From our brother England?	999
	999
EXETER	From him; and thus he greets your majesty.	999
	He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,	999
	That you divest yourself, and lay apart	999
	The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,	999
	By law of nature and of nations, 'long	999
	To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown	999
	And all wide-stretched honours that pertain	999
	By custom and the ordinance of times	999
	Unto the crown of France. That you may know	999
	'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,	999
	Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,	999
	Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,	999
	He sends you this most memorable line,	999
	In every branch truly demonstrative;	999
	Willing to overlook this pedigree:	999
	And when you find him evenly derived	999
	From his most famed of famous ancestors,	999
	Edward the Third, he bids you then resign	999
	Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held	999
	From him the native and true challenger.	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	Or else what follows?	999
	999
EXETER	Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown	999
	Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:	999
	Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,	999
	In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,	999
	That, if requiring fail, he will compel;	999
	And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,	999
	Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy	999
	On the poor souls for whom this hungry war	999
	Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head	999
	Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries	999
	The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,	999
	For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,	999
	That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.	999
	This is his claim, his threatening and my message;	999
	Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,	999
	To whom expressly I bring greeting too.	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	For us, we will consider of this further:	999
	To-morrow shall you bear our full intent	999
	Back to our brother England.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	For the Dauphin,	999
	I stand here for him: what to him from England?	999
	999
EXETER	Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,	999
	And any thing that may not misbecome	999
	The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.	999
	Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness	999
	Do not, in grant of all demands at large,	999
	Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,	999
	He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,	999
	That caves and womby vaultages of France	999
	Shall chide your trespass and return your mock	999
	In second accent of his ordnance.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Say, if my father render fair return,	999
	It is against my will; for I desire	999
	Nothing but odds with England: to that end,	999
	As matching to his youth and vanity,	999
	I did present him with the Paris balls.	999
	999
EXETER	He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,	999
	Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:	999
	And, be assured, you'll find a difference,	999
	As we his subjects have in wonder found,	999
	Between the promise of his greener days	999
	And these he masters now: now he weighs time	999
	Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read	999
	In your own losses, if he stay in France.	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.	999
	999
EXETER	Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king	999
	Come here himself to question our delay;	999
	For he is footed in this land already.	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	You shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions:	999
	A night is but small breath and little pause	999
	To answer matters of this consequence.	999

	999
	[Enter Chorus]	999
	999
Chorus	Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies	999
	In motion of no less celerity	999
	Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen	999
	The well-appointed king at Hampton pier	999
	Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet	999
	With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:	999
	Play with your fancies, and in them behold	999
	Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;	999
	Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give	999
	To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,	999
	Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,	999
	Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,	999
	Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think	999
	You stand upon the ravage and behold	999
	A city on the inconstant billows dancing;	999
	For so appears this fleet majestical,	999
	Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:	999
	Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,	999
	And leave your England, as dead midnight still,	999
	Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,	999
	Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;	999
	For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd	999
	With one appearing hair, that will not follow	999
	These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?	999
	Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;	999
	Behold the ordnance on their carriages,	999
	With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.	999
	Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;	999
	Tells Harry that the king doth offer him	999
	Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,	999
	Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.	999
	The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner	999
	With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,	999
	999
	[Alarum, and chambers go off]	999

	And down goes all before them. Still be kind,	999

	In peace there's nothing so becomes a man	999
	As modest stillness and humility:	999
	But when the blast of war blows in our ears,	999
	Then imitate the action of the tiger;	999
	Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,	999
	Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;	999
	Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;	999
	Let pry through the portage of the head	999
	Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it	999
	As fearfully as doth a galled rock	999
	O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,	999
	Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.	999
	Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,	999
	Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit	999
	To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.	999
	Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!	999
	Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,	999
	Have in these parts from morn till even fought	999
	And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:	999
	Dishonour not your mothers; now attest	999
	That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.	999
	Be copy now to men of grosser blood,	999
	And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,	999
	Whose limbs were made in England, show us here	999
	The mettle of your pasture; let us swear	999
	That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;	999
	For there is none of you so mean and base,	999
	That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.	999
	I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,	999
	Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:	999
	Follow your spirit, and upon this charge	999
	Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'	999

	[Enter NYM, BARDOLPH, PISTOL, and Boy]	999
	999
BARDOLPH	On, on, on, on, on! to the breach, to the breach!	999
	999
NYM	Pray thee, corporal, stay: the knocks are too hot;	999
	and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives:	999
	the humour of it is too hot, that is the very	999
	plain-song of it.	999
	999
PISTOL	The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound:	999
	Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;	999
	And sword and shield,	999
	In bloody field,	999
	Doth win immortal fame.	999
	999
Boy	Would I were in an alehouse in London! I would give	999
	all my fame for a pot of ale and safety.	999
	999
PISTOL	And I:	999
	If wishes would prevail with me,	999
	My purpose should not fail with me,	999
	But thither would I hie.	999
	999
Boy	          As duly, but not as truly,	999

	[Enter FLUELLEN]	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Up to the breach, you dogs! avaunt, you cullions!	999
	999
	[Driving them forward]	999
	999
PISTOL	Be merciful, great duke, to men of mould.	999
	Abate thy rage, abate thy manly rage,	999
	Abate thy rage, great duke!	999
	Good bawcock, bate thy rage; use lenity, sweet chuck!	999
	999
NYM	These be good humours! your honour wins bad humours.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but Boy]	999
	999
Boy	As young as I am, I have observed these three	999
	swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they	999
	three, though they would serve me, could not be man	999
	to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to	999
	a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and	999
	red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but	999
	fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue	999
	and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks	999
	words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath	999
	heard that men of few words are the best men; and	999
	therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'	999
	should be thought a coward: but his few bad words	999
	are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never	999
	broke any man's head but his own, and that was	999
	against a post when he was drunk. They will steal	999
	any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a	999
	lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for	999
	three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn	999
	brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a	999
	fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the	999
	men would carry coals. They would have me as	999
	familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their	999
	handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,	999
	if I should take from another's pocket to put into	999
	mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I	999
	must leave them, and seek some better service:	999
	their villany goes against my weak stomach, and	999
	therefore I must cast it up.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Re-enter FLUELLEN, GOWER following]	999
	999
GOWER	Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the	999
	mines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	To the mines! tell you the duke, it is not so good	999
	to come to the mines; for, look you, the mines is	999
	not according to the disciplines of the war: the	999
	concavities of it is not sufficient; for, look you,	999
	the athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look	999
	you, is digt himself four yard under the	999
	countermines: by Cheshu, I think a' will plough up	999
	all, if there is not better directions.	999
	999
GOWER	The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the	999
	siege is given, is altogether directed by an	999
	Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?	999
	999
GOWER	I think it be.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I will	999
	verify as much in his beard: be has no more	999
	directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look	999
	you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy-dog.	999
	999
	[Enter MACMORRIS and Captain JAMY]	999
	999
GOWER	Here a' comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Captain Jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman,	999
	that is certain; and of great expedition and	999
	knowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particular	999
	knowledge of his directions: by Cheshu, he will	999
	maintain his argument as well as any military man in	999
	the world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars	999
	of the Romans.	999
	999
JAMY	I say gud-day, Captain Fluellen.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	God-den to your worship, good Captain James.	999
	999
GOWER	How now, Captain Macmorris! have you quit the	999
	mines? have the pioneers given o'er?	999
	999
MACMORRIS	By Chrish, la! tish ill done: the work ish give	999
	over, the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I	999
	swear, and my father's soul, the work ish ill done;	999
	it ish give over: I would have blowed up the town, so	999
	Chrish save me, la! in an hour: O, tish ill done,	999
	tish ill done; by my hand, tish ill done!	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you	999
	voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you,	999
	as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of	999
	the war, the Roman wars, in the way of argument,	999
	look you, and friendly communication; partly to	999
	satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction,	999
	look you, of my mind, as touching the direction of	999
	the military discipline; that is the point.	999
	999
JAMY	It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains bath:	999
	and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pick	999
	occasion; that sall I, marry.	999
	999
MACMORRIS	It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me: the	999
	day is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the	999
	king, and the dukes: it is no time to discourse. The	999
	town is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the	999
	breach; and we talk, and, be Chrish, do nothing:	999
	'tis shame for us all: so God sa' me, 'tis shame to	999
	stand still; it is shame, by my hand: and there is	999
	throats to be cut, and works to be done; and there	999
	ish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me, la!	999
	999
JAMY	By the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves	999
	to slomber, ay'll de gud service, or ay'll lig i'	999
	the grund for it; ay, or go to death; and ay'll pay	999
	't as valourously as I may, that sall I suerly do,	999
	that is the breff and the long. Marry, I wad full	999
	fain hear some question 'tween you tway.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your	999
	correction, there is not many of your nation--	999
	999
MACMORRIS	Of my nation! What ish my nation? Ish a villain,	999
	and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish	999
	my nation? Who talks of my nation?	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is	999
	meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think	999
	you do not use me with that affability as in	999
	discretion you ought to use me, look you: being as	999
	good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of	999
	war, and in the derivation of my birth, and in	999
	other particularities.	999
	999
MACMORRIS	I do not know you so good a man as myself: so	999
	Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.	999
	999
GOWER	Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.	999
	999
JAMY	A! that's a foul fault.	999
	999
	[A parley sounded]	999
	999
GOWER	The town sounds a parley.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Captain Macmorris, when there is more better	999
	opportunity to be required, look you, I will be so	999
	bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war;	999
	and there is an end.	999

	999
	[The Governor and some Citizens on the walls; the	999
	English forces below. Enter KING HENRY and his train]	999
	999
KING HENRY V	How yet resolves the governor of the town?	999
	This is the latest parle we will admit;	999
	Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;	999
	Or like to men proud of destruction	999
	Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,	999
	A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,	999
	If I begin the battery once again,	999
	I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur	999
	Till in her ashes she lie buried.	999
	The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,	999
	And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,	999
	In liberty of bloody hand shall range	999
	With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass	999
	Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.	999
	What is it then to me, if impious war,	999
	Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,	999
	Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats	999
	Enlink'd to waste and desolation?	999
	What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,	999
	If your pure maidens fall into the hand	999
	Of hot and forcing violation?	999
	What rein can hold licentious wickedness	999
	When down the hill he holds his fierce career?	999
	We may as bootless spend our vain command	999
	Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil	999
	As send precepts to the leviathan	999
	To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,	999
	Take pity of your town and of your people,	999
	Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;	999
	Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace	999
	O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds	999
	Of heady murder, spoil and villany.	999
	If not, why, in a moment look to see	999
	The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand	999
	Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;	999
	Your fathers taken by the silver beards,	999
	And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,	999
	Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,	999
	Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused	999
	Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry	999
	At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.	999
	What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,	999
	Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?	999
	999
GOVERNOR	Our expectation hath this day an end:	999
	The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,	999
	Returns us that his powers are yet not ready	999
	To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,	999
	We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.	999
	Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;	999
	For we no longer are defensible.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,	999
	Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,	999
	And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:	999
	Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,	999
	The winter coming on and sickness growing	999
	Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.	999

KATHARINE	La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. Je pense	999

KING OF FRANCE	'Tis certain he hath pass'd the river Somme.	999
	999
Constable	And if he be not fought withal, my lord,	999
	Let us not live in France; let us quit all	999
	And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,	999
	The emptying of our fathers' luxury,	999
	Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,	999
	Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,	999
	And overlook their grafters?	999
	999
BOURBON	Normans, but bastard Normans, Norman bastards!	999
	Mort de ma vie! if they march along	999
	Unfought withal, but I will sell my dukedom,	999
	To buy a slobbery and a dirty farm	999
	In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.	999
	999
Constable	Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?	999
	Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull,	999
	On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,	999
	Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,	999
	A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,	999
	Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?	999
	And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,	999
	Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,	999
	Let us not hang like roping icicles	999
	Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people	999
	Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!	999
	Poor we may call them in their native lords.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	By faith and honour,	999
	Our madams mock at us, and plainly say	999
	Our mettle is bred out and they will give	999
	Their bodies to the lust of English youth	999
	To new-store France with bastard warriors.	999
	999
BOURBON	They bid us to the English dancing-schools,	999
	And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos;	999
	Saying our grace is only in our heels,	999
	And that we are most lofty runaways.	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence:	999
	Let him greet England with our sharp defiance.	999
	Up, princes! and, with spirit of honour edged	999
	More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:	999
	Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;	999
	You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berri,	999
	Alencon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy;	999
	Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont,	999
	Beaumont, Grandpre, Roussi, and Fauconberg,	999
	Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois;	999
	High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights,	999
	For your great seats now quit you of great shames.	999
	Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land	999
	With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur:	999
	Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow	999
	Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat	999
	The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:	999
	Go down upon him, you have power enough,	999
	And in a captive chariot into Rouen	999
	Bring him our prisoner.	999
	999
Constable	This becomes the great.	999
	Sorry am I his numbers are so few,	999
	His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,	999
	For I am sure, when he shall see our army,	999
	He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear	999
	And for achievement offer us his ransom.	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy.	999
	And let him say to England that we send	999
	To know what willing ransom he will give.	999
	Prince Dauphin, you shall stay with us in Rouen.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Not so, I do beseech your majesty.	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	Be patient, for you shall remain with us.	999
	Now forth, lord constable and princes all,	999
	And quickly bring us word of England's fall.	999

ACT III	999

	999
SCENE VI	The English camp in Picardy.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter GOWER and FLUELLEN, meeting]	999
	999
GOWER	How now, Captain Fluellen! come you from the bridge?	999
	999
FLUELLEN	I assure you, there is very excellent services	999
	committed at the bridge.	999
	999
GOWER	Is the Duke of Exeter safe?	999
	999
FLUELLEN	The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon;	999
	and a man that I love and honour with my soul, and my	999
	heart, and my duty, and my life, and my living, and	999
	my uttermost power: he is not-God be praised and	999
	blessed!--any hurt in the world; but keeps the	999
	bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline.	999
	There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the	999
	pridge, I think in my very conscience he is as	999
	valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is a man of no	999
	estimation in the world; but did see him do as	999
	gallant service.	999
	999
GOWER	What do you call him?	999
	999
FLUELLEN	He is called Aunchient Pistol.	999
	999
GOWER	I know him not.	999
	999
	[Enter PISTOL]	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Here is the man.	999
	999
PISTOL	Captain, I thee beseech to do me favours:	999
	The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love at	999
	his hands.	999
	999
PISTOL	Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,	999
	And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,	999
	And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,	999
	That goddess blind,	999
	That stands upon the rolling restless stone--	999
	999
FLUELLEN	By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is	999
	painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to	999
	signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is	999
	painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which	999
	is the moral of it, that she is turning, and	999
	inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her	999
	foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,	999
	which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,	999
	the poet makes a most excellent description of it:	999
	Fortune is an excellent moral.	999
	999
PISTOL	Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;	999
	For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:	999
	A damned death!	999
	Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free	999
	And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:	999
	But Exeter hath given the doom of death	999
	For pax of little price.	999
	Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:	999
	And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut	999
	With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:	999
	Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.	999
	999
PISTOL	Why then, rejoice therefore.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice	999
	at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would	999
	desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put	999
	him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.	999
	999
PISTOL	Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!	999
	999
FLUELLEN	It is well.	999
	999
PISTOL	The fig of Spain!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Very good.	999
	999
GOWER	Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I	999
	remember him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	I'll assure you, a' uttered as brave words at the	999
	bridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it	999
	is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well,	999
	I warrant you, when time is serve.	999
	999
GOWER	Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then	999
	goes to the wars, to grace himself at his return	999
	into London under the form of a soldier. And such	999
	fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:	999
	and they will learn you by rote where services were	999
	done; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,	999
	at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was	999
	shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;	999
	and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,	999
	which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what	999
	a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of	999
	the camp will do among foaming bottles and	999
	ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But	999
	you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or	999
	else you may be marvellously mistook.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	I tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he is	999
	not the man that he would gladly make show to the	999
	world he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I will	999
	tell him my mind.	999
	999
	[Drum heard]	999
	999
	Hark you, the king is coming, and I must speak with	999
	him from the pridge.	999
	999
	[Drum and colours. Enter KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, and Soldiers]	999
	999
	God pless your majesty!	999
	999
KING HENRY V	How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has	999
	very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is	999
	gone off, look you; and there is gallant and most	999
	prave passages; marry, th' athversary was have	999
	possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to	999
	retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the	999
	pridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a	999
	prave man.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	What men have you lost, Fluellen?	999
	999
FLUELLEN	The perdition of th' athversary hath been very	999
	great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I	999
	think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that	999
	is like to be executed for robbing a church, one	999
	Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is	999
	all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o'	999
	fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like	999
	a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;	999
	but his nose is executed and his fire's out.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	We would have all such offenders so cut off: and we	999
	give express charge, that in our marches through the	999
	country, there be nothing compelled from the	999
	villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the	999
	French upbraided or abused in disdainful language;	999
	for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the	999
	gentler gamester is the soonest winner.	999
	999
	[Tucket. Enter MONTJOY]	999
	999
MONTJOY	You know me by my habit.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Well then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?	999
	999
MONTJOY	My master's mind.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Unfold it.	999
	999
MONTJOY	Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:	999
	Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage	999
	is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we	999
	could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we	999
	thought not good to bruise an injury till it were	999
	full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice	999
	is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see	999
	his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him	999
	therefore consider of his ransom; which must	999
	proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we	999
	have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in	999
	weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.	999
	For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the	999
	effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too	999
	faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own	999
	person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and	999
	worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and	999
	tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his	999
	followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far	999
	my king and master; so much my office.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	What is thy name? I know thy quality.	999
	999
MONTJOY	Montjoy.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.	999
	And tell thy king I do not seek him now;	999
	But could be willing to march on to Calais	999
	Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,	999
	Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much	999
	Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,	999
	My people are with sickness much enfeebled,	999
	My numbers lessened, and those few I have	999
	Almost no better than so many French;	999
	Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,	999
	I thought upon one pair of English legs	999
	Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,	999
	That I do brag thus! This your air of France	999
	Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.	999
	Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;	999
	My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,	999
	My army but a weak and sickly guard;	999
	Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,	999
	Though France himself and such another neighbour	999
	Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.	999
	Go bid thy master well advise himself:	999
	If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,	999
	We shall your tawny ground with your red blood	999
	Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.	999
	The sum of all our answer is but this:	999
	We would not seek a battle, as we are;	999
	Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:	999
	So tell your master.	999
	999
MONTJOY	I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I hope they will not come upon us now.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.	999
	March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:	999
	Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,	999
	And on to-morrow, bid them march away.	999

SCENE VII	The French camp, near Agincourt:	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the Constable of France, the LORD RAMBURES,	999
	ORLEANS, DAUPHIN, with others]	999
	999
Constable	Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!	999
	999
ORLEANS	You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.	999
	999
Constable	It is the best horse of Europe.	999
	999
ORLEANS	Will it never be morning?	999
	999
DAUPHIN	My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, you	999
	talk of horse and armour?	999
	999
ORLEANS	You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	What a long night is this! I will not change my	999
	horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.	999
	Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his	999
	entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,	999
	chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I	999
	soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth	999
	sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his	999
	hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.	999
	999
ORLEANS	He's of the colour of the nutmeg.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for	999
	Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull	999
	elements of earth and water never appear in him, but	999
	only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts	999
	him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you	999
	may call beasts.	999
	999
Constable	Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the	999
	bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.	999
	999
ORLEANS	No more, cousin.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the	999
	rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary	999
	deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as	999
	fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent	999
	tongues, and my horse is argument for them all:	999
	'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for	999
	a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the	999
	world, familiar to us and unknown to lay apart	999
	their particular functions and wonder at him. I	999
	once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:	999
	'Wonder of nature,'--	999
	999
ORLEANS	I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Then did they imitate that which I composed to my	999
	courser, for my horse is my mistress.	999
	999
ORLEANS	Your mistress bears well.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Me well; which is the prescript praise and	999
	perfection of a good and particular mistress.	999
	999
Constable	Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly	999
	shook your back.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	So perhaps did yours.	999
	999
Constable	Mine was not bridled.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	O then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode,	999
	like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in	999
	your straight strossers.	999
	999
Constable	You have good judgment in horsemanship.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ride	999
	not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have	999
	my horse to my mistress.	999
	999
Constable	I had as lief have my mistress a jade.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.	999
	999
Constable	I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow	999
	to my mistress.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, et	999
	la truie lavee au bourbier;' thou makest use of any thing.	999
	999
Constable	Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any	999
	such proverb so little kin to the purpose.	999
	999
RAMBURES	My lord constable, the armour that I saw in your tent	999
	to-night, are those stars or suns upon it?	999
	999
Constable	Stars, my lord.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.	999
	999
Constable	And yet my sky shall not want.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and	999
	'twere more honour some were away.	999
	999
Constable	Even as your horse bears your praises; who would	999
	trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will	999
	it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and	999
	my way shall be paved with English faces.	999
	999
Constable	I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of	999
	my way: but I would it were morning; for I would	999
	fain be about the ears of the English.	999
	999
RAMBURES	Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?	999
	999
Constable	You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you have them.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
ORLEANS	The Dauphin longs for morning.	999
	999
RAMBURES	He longs to eat the English.	999
	999
Constable	I think he will eat all he kills.	999
	999
ORLEANS	By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.	999
	999
Constable	Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.	999
	999
ORLEANS	He is simply the most active gentleman of France.	999
	999
Constable	Doing is activity; and he will still be doing.	999
	999
ORLEANS	He never did harm, that I heard of.	999
	999
Constable	Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.	999
	999
ORLEANS	I know him to be valiant.	999
	999
Constable	I was told that by one that knows him better than	999
	you.	999
	999
ORLEANS	What's he?	999
	999
Constable	Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he cared	999
	not who knew it	999
	999
ORLEANS	He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.	999
	999
Constable	By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw it	999
	but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when it	999
	appears, it will bate.	999
	999
ORLEANS	Ill will never said well.	999
	999
Constable	I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'	999
	999
ORLEANS	And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'	999
	999
Constable	Well placed: there stands your friend for the	999
	devil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A	999
	pox of the devil.'	999
	999
ORLEANS	You are the better at proverbs, by how much 'A	999
	fool's bolt is soon shot.'	999
	999
Constable	You have shot over.	999
	999
ORLEANS	'Tis not the first time you were overshot.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	My lord high constable, the English lie within	999
	fifteen hundred paces of your tents.	999
	999
Constable	Who hath measured the ground?	999
	999
Messenger	The Lord Grandpre.	999
	999
Constable	A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were	999
	day! Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not for	999
	the dawning as we do.	999
	999
ORLEANS	What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of	999
	England, to mope with his fat-brained followers so	999
	far out of his knowledge!	999
	999
Constable	If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.	999
	999
ORLEANS	That they lack; for if their heads had any	999
	intellectual armour, they could never wear such heavy	999
	head-pieces.	999
	999
RAMBURES	That island of England breeds very valiant	999
	creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.	999
	999
ORLEANS	Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a	999
	Russian bear and have their heads crushed like	999
	rotten apples! You may as well say, that's a	999
	valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.	999
	999
Constable	Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the	999
	mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving	999
	their wits with their wives: and then give them	999
	great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will	999
	eat like wolves and fight like devils.	999
	999
ORLEANS	Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.	999
	999
Constable	Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs	999
	to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:	999
	come, shall we about it?	999
	999
ORLEANS	It is now two o'clock: but, let me see, by ten	999
	We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.	999

	PROLOGUE.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter Chorus]	999
	999
Chorus	Now entertain conjecture of a time	999
	When creeping murmur and the poring dark	999
	Fills the wide vessel of the universe.	999
	From camp to camp through the foul womb of night	999
	The hum of either army stilly sounds,	999
	That the fixed sentinels almost receive	999
	The secret whispers of each other's watch:	999
	Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames	999
	Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;	999
	Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs	999
	Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents	999
	The armourers, accomplishing the knights,	999
	With busy hammers closing rivets up,	999
	Give dreadful note of preparation:	999
	The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,	999
	And the third hour of drowsy morning name.	999
	Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,	999
	The confident and over-lusty French	999
	Do the low-rated English play at dice;	999
	And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night	999
	Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp	999
	So tediously away. The poor condemned English,	999
	Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires	999
	Sit patiently and inly ruminate	999
	The morning's danger, and their gesture sad	999
	Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats	999
	Presenteth them unto the gazing moon	999
	So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold	999
	The royal captain of this ruin'd band	999
	Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,	999
	Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'	999
	For forth he goes and visits all his host.	999
	Bids them good morrow with a modest smile	999
	And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.	999
	Upon his royal face there is no note	999
	How dread an army hath enrounded him;	999
	Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour	999
	Unto the weary and all-watched night,	999
	But freshly looks and over-bears attaint	999
	With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;	999
	That every wretch, pining and pale before,	999
	Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:	999
	A largess universal like the sun	999
	His liberal eye doth give to every one,	999
	Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,	999
	Behold, as may unworthiness define,	999
	A little touch of Harry in the night.	999
	And so our scene must to the battle fly;	999
	Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace	999
	With four or five most vile and ragged foils,	999
	Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,	999
	The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,	999
	Minding true things by what their mockeries be.	999

ACT IV	999

	999
SCENE I	The English camp at Agincourt.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING HENRY, BEDFORD, and GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;	999
	The greater therefore should our courage be.	999
	Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!	999
	There is some soul of goodness in things evil,	999
	Would men observingly distil it out.	999
	For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,	999
	Which is both healthful and good husbandry:	999
	Besides, they are our outward consciences,	999
	And preachers to us all, admonishing	999
	That we should dress us fairly for our end.	999
	Thus may we gather honey from the weed,	999
	And make a moral of the devil himself.	999
	999
	[Enter ERPINGHAM]	999
	999
	Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:	999
	A good soft pillow for that good white head	999
	Were better than a churlish turf of France.	999
	999
ERPINGHAM	Not so, my liege: this lodging likes me better,	999
	Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.'	999
	999
KING HENRY V	'Tis good for men to love their present pains	999
	Upon example; so the spirit is eased:	999
	And when the mind is quicken'd, out of doubt,	999
	The organs, though defunct and dead before,	999
	Break up their drowsy grave and newly move,	999
	With casted slough and fresh legerity.	999
	Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,	999
	Commend me to the princes in our camp;	999
	Do my good morrow to them, and anon	999
	Desire them an to my pavilion.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	We shall, my liege.	999
	999
ERPINGHAM	Shall I attend your grace?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	No, my good knight;	999
	Go with my brothers to my lords of England:	999
	I and my bosom must debate awhile,	999
	And then I would no other company.	999
	999
ERPINGHAM	The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but KING HENRY]	999
	999
KING HENRY V	God-a-mercy, old heart! thou speak'st cheerfully.	999
	999
	[Enter PISTOL]	999
	999
PISTOL	Qui va la?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	A friend.	999
	999
PISTOL	Discuss unto me; art thou officer?	999
	Or art thou base, common and popular?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	I am a gentleman of a company.	999
	999
PISTOL	Trail'st thou the puissant pike?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Even so. What are you?	999
	999
PISTOL	As good a gentleman as the emperor.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Then you are a better than the king.	999
	999
PISTOL	The king's a bawcock, and a heart of gold,	999
	A lad of life, an imp of fame;	999
	Of parents good, of fist most valiant.	999
	I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-string	999
	I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Harry le Roy.	999
	999
PISTOL	Le Roy! a Cornish name: art thou of Cornish crew?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	No, I am a Welshman.	999
	999
PISTOL	Know'st thou Fluellen?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Yes.	999
	999
PISTOL	Tell him, I'll knock his leek about his pate	999
	Upon Saint Davy's day.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day,	999
	lest he knock that about yours.	999
	999
PISTOL	Art thou his friend?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	And his kinsman too.	999
	999
PISTOL	The figo for thee, then!	999
	999
KING HENRY V	I thank you: God be with you!	999
	999
PISTOL	My name is Pistol call'd.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING HENRY V	It sorts well with your fierceness.	999
	999
	[Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER]	999
	999
GOWER	Captain Fluellen!	999
	999
FLUELLEN	So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak lower. It is	999
	the greatest admiration of the universal world, when	999
	the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the	999
	wars is not kept: if you would take the pains but to	999
	examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall	999
	find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddle	999
	nor pibble pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you,	999
	you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the	999
	cares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobriety	999
	of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.	999
	999
GOWER	Why, the enemy is loud; you hear him all night.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating	999
	coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also,	999
	look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating	999
	coxcomb? in your own conscience, now?	999
	999
GOWER	I will speak lower.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	I pray you and beseech you that you will.	999
	999
	[Exeunt GOWER and FLUELLEN]	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Though it appear a little out of fashion,	999
	There is much care and valour in this Welshman.	999
	999
	[Enter three soldiers, JOHN BATES, ALEXANDER COURT,	999
	and MICHAEL WILLIAMS]	999
	999
COURT	Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which	999
	breaks yonder?	999
	999
BATES	I think it be: but we have no great cause to desire	999
	the approach of day.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think	999
	we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	A friend.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	Under what captain serve you?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I	999
	pray you, what thinks he of our estate?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be	999
	washed off the next tide.	999
	999
BATES	He hath not told his thought to the king?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I	999
	speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I	999
	am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the	999
	element shows to him as it doth to me; all his	999
	senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies	999
	laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and	999
	though his affections are higher mounted than ours,	999
	yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like	999
	wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we	999
	do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish	999
	as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess	999
	him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing	999
	it, should dishearten his army.	999
	999
BATES	He may show what outward courage he will; but I	999
	believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish	999
	himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he	999
	were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:	999
	I think he would not wish himself any where but	999
	where he is.	999
	999
BATES	Then I would he were here alone; so should he be	999
	sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here	999
	alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's	999
	minds: methinks I could not die any where so	999
	contented as in the king's company; his cause being	999
	just and his quarrel honourable.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	That's more than we know.	999
	999
BATES	Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know	999
	enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if	999
	his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes	999
	the crime of it out of us.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath	999
	a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and	999
	arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join	999
	together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at	999
	such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a	999
	surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind	999
	them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their	999
	children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die	999
	well that die in a battle; for how can they	999
	charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their	999
	argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it	999
	will be a black matter for the king that led them to	999
	it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of	999
	subjection.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	So, if a son that is by his father sent about	999
	merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the	999
	imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be	999
	imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a	999
	servant, under his master's command transporting a	999
	sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in	999
	many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the	999
	business of the master the author of the servant's	999
	damnation: but this is not so: the king is not	999
	bound to answer the particular endings of his	999
	soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of	999
	his servant; for they purpose not their death, when	999
	they purpose their services. Besides, there is no	999
	king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to	999
	the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all	999
	unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them	999
	the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;	999
	some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of	999
	perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that	999
	have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with	999
	pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have	999
	defeated the law and outrun native punishment,	999
	though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to	999
	fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;	999
	so that here men are punished for before-breach of	999
	the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where	999
	they feared the death, they have borne life away;	999
	and where they would be safe, they perish: then if	999
	they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of	999
	their damnation than he was before guilty of those	999
	impieties for the which they are now visited. Every	999
	subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's	999
	soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in	999
	the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every	999
	mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death	999
	is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was	999
	blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:	999
	and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think	999
	that, making God so free an offer, He let him	999
	outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach	999
	others how they should prepare.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon	999
	his own head, the king is not to answer it.	999
	999
BATES	But I do not desire he should answer for me; and	999
	yet I determine to fight lustily for him.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but	999
	when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we	999
	ne'er the wiser.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an	999
	elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can	999
	do against a monarch! you may as well go about to	999
	turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a	999
	peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word	999
	after! come, 'tis a foolish saying.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Your reproof is something too round: I should be	999
	angry with you, if the time were convenient.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	I embrace it.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	How shall I know thee again?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my	999
	bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I	999
	will make it my quarrel.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	Here's my glove: give me another of thine.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	There.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come	999
	to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'	999
	by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	Thou darest as well be hanged.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Well. I will do it, though I take thee in the	999
	king's company.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	Keep thy word: fare thee well.	999
	999
BATES	Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have	999
	French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to	999
	one, they will beat us; for they bear them on their	999
	shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut	999
	French crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will	999
	be a clipper.	999
	999
	[Exeunt soldiers]	999
	999
	Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,	999
	Our debts, our careful wives,	999
	Our children and our sins lay on the king!	999
	We must bear all. O hard condition,	999
	Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath	999
	Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel	999
	But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease	999
	Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!	999
	And what have kings, that privates have not too,	999
	Save ceremony, save general ceremony?	999
	And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?	999
	What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more	999
	Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?	999
	What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?	999
	O ceremony, show me but thy worth!	999
	What is thy soul of adoration?	999
	Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,	999
	Creating awe and fear in other men?	999
	Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd	999
	Than they in fearing.	999
	What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,	999
	But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,	999
	And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!	999
	Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out	999
	With titles blown from adulation?	999
	Will it give place to flexure and low bending?	999
	Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,	999
	Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,	999
	That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;	999
	I am a king that find thee, and I know	999
	'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,	999
	The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,	999
	The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,	999
	The farced title running 'fore the king,	999
	The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp	999
	That beats upon the high shore of this world,	999
	No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,	999
	Not all these, laid in bed majestical,	999
	Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,	999
	Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind	999
	Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;	999
	Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,	999
	But, like a lackey, from the rise to set	999
	Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night	999
	Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,	999
	Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,	999
	And follows so the ever-running year,	999
	With profitable labour, to his grave:	999
	And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,	999
	Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,	999
	Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.	999
	The slave, a member of the country's peace,	999
	Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots	999
	What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,	999
	Whose hours the peasant best advantages.	999
	999

KING HENRY V	Good old knight,	999
	Collect them all together at my tent:	999
	I'll be before thee.	999
	999
ERPINGHAM	I shall do't, my lord.	999
	999

	999
KING HENRY V	O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;	999
	Possess them not with fear; take from them now	999
	The sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers	999
	Pluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O Lord,	999
	O, not to-day, think not upon the fault	999
	My father made in compassing the crown!	999
	I Richard's body have interred anew;	999
	And on it have bestow'd more contrite tears	999
	Than from it issued forced drops of blood:	999
	Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay,	999
	Who twice a-day their wither'd hands hold up	999
	Toward heaven, to pardon blood; and I have built	999
	Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests	999
	Sing still for Richard's soul. More will I do;	999
	Though all that I can do is nothing worth,	999
	Since that my penitence comes after all,	999
	Imploring pardon.	999
	999

SCENE II	The French camp.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the DAUPHIN, ORLEANS, RAMBURES, and others]	999
	999
ORLEANS	The sun doth gild our armour; up, my lords!	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Montez A cheval! My horse! varlet! laquais! ha!	999
	999
ORLEANS	O brave spirit!	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Via! les eaux et la terre.	999
	999
ORLEANS	Rien puis? L'air et la feu.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Ciel, cousin Orleans.	999
	999
	[Enter Constable]	999
	999
	Now, my lord constable!	999
	999
Constable	Hark, how our steeds for present service neigh!	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Mount them, and make incision in their hides,	999
	That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,	999
	And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!	999
	999
RAMBURES	What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?	999
	How shall we, then, behold their natural tears?	999
	999
	[Enter Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	The English are embattled, you French peers.	999
	999
Constable	To horse, you gallant princes! straight to horse!	999
	Do but behold yon poor and starved band,	999
	And your fair show shall suck away their souls,	999
	Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.	999
	There is not work enough for all our hands;	999
	Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins	999
	To give each naked curtle-axe a stain,	999
	That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,	999
	And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,	999
	The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.	999
	'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,	999
	That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,	999
	Who in unnecessary action swarm	999
	About our squares of battle, were enow	999
	To purge this field of such a hilding foe,	999
	Though we upon this mountain's basis by	999
	Took stand for idle speculation:	999
	But that our honours must not. What's to say?	999
	A very little little let us do.	999
	And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound	999
	The tucket sonance and the note to mount;	999
	For our approach shall so much dare the field	999
	That England shall couch down in fear and yield.	999
	999
	[Enter GRANDPRE]	999
	999
GRANDPRE	Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?	999
	Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,	999
	Ill-favouredly become the morning field:	999
	Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,	999
	And our air shakes them passing scornfully:	999
	Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host	999
	And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps:	999
	The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks,	999
	With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor jades	999
	Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,	999
	The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes	999
	And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit	999
	Lies foul with chew'd grass, still and motionless;	999
	And their executors, the knavish crows,	999
	Fly o'er them, all impatient for their hour.	999
	Description cannot suit itself in words	999

	In life so lifeless as it shows itself.	999
	999
Constable	They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.	999
	999
DAUPHIN	Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits	999
	And give their fasting horses provender,	999
	And after fight with them?	999
	999
Constable	I stay but for my guidon: to the field!	999
	I will the banner from a trumpet take,	999

	all his host: SALISBURY and WESTMORELAND]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Where is the king?	999
	999
BEDFORD	The king himself is rode to view their battle.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Of fighting men they have full three score thousand.	999
	999
EXETER	There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.	999
	999
SALISBURY	God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.	999
	God be wi' you, princes all; I'll to my charge:	999
	If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,	999
	Then, joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford,	999
	My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,	999
	And my kind kinsman, warriors all, adieu!	999
	999
BEDFORD	Farewell, good Salisbury; and good luck go with thee!	999
	999
EXETER	Farewell, kind lord; fight valiantly to-day:	999
	And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,	999
	For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour.	999
	999
	[Exit SALISBURY]	999
	999
BEDFORD	He is full of valour as of kindness;	999
	Princely in both.	999
	999
	[Enter the KING]	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	                  O that we now had here	999
	But one ten thousand of those men in England	999
	That do no work to-day!	999
	999
KING HENRY V	What's he that wishes so?	999
	My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:	999
	If we are mark'd to die, we are enow	999
	To do our country loss; and if to live,	999
	The fewer men, the greater share of honour.	999
	God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.	999
	By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,	999
	Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;	999
	It yearns me not if men my garments wear;	999
	Such outward things dwell not in my desires:	999
	But if it be a sin to covet honour,	999
	I am the most offending soul alive.	999
	No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:	999
	God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour	999
	As one man more, methinks, would share from me	999
	For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!	999
	Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,	999
	That he which hath no stomach to this fight,	999
	Let him depart; his passport shall be made	999
	And crowns for convoy put into his purse:	999
	We would not die in that man's company	999
	That fears his fellowship to die with us.	999
	This day is called the feast of Crispian:	999
	He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,	999
	Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,	999
	And rouse him at the name of Crispian.	999
	He that shall live this day, and see old age,	999
	Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,	999
	And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'	999
	Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.	999
	And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'	999
	Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,	999
	But he'll remember with advantages	999
	What feats he did that day: then shall our names.	999
	Familiar in his mouth as household words	999
	Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,	999
	Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,	999
	Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.	999
	This story shall the good man teach his son;	999
	And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,	999
	From this day to the ending of the world,	999
	But we in it shall be remember'd;	999
	We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;	999
	For he to-day that sheds his blood with me	999
	Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,	999
	This day shall gentle his condition:	999
	And gentlemen in England now a-bed	999
	Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,	999
	And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks	999
	That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.	999
	999
	[Re-enter SALISBURY]	999
	999
SALISBURY	My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed:	999
	The French are bravely in their battles set,	999
	And will with all expedience charge on us.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	All things are ready, if our minds be so.	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	Perish the man whose mind is backward now!	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	God's will! my liege, would you and I alone,	999
	Without more help, could fight this royal battle!	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Why, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men;	999
	Which likes me better than to wish us one.	999
	You know your places: God be with you all!	999
	999
	[Tucket. Enter MONTJOY]	999
	999
MONTJOY	Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry,	999
	If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,	999
	Before thy most assured overthrow:	999
	For certainly thou art so near the gulf,	999
	Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy,	999
	The constable desires thee thou wilt mind	999
	Thy followers of repentance; that their souls	999
	May make a peaceful and a sweet retire	999
	From off these fields, where, wretches, their poor bodies	999
	Must lie and fester.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Who hath sent thee now?	999
	999
MONTJOY	The Constable of France.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	I pray thee, bear my former answer back:	999
	Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.	999
	Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?	999
	The man that once did sell the lion's skin	999
	While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.	999
	A many of our bodies shall no doubt	999
	Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,	999
	Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:	999
	And those that leave their valiant bones in France,	999
	Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,	999
	They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,	999
	And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;	999
	Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,	999
	The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.	999
	Mark then abounding valour in our English,	999
	That being dead, like to the bullet's grazing,	999
	Break out into a second course of mischief,	999
	Killing in relapse of mortality.	999
	Let me speak proudly: tell the constable	999
	We are but warriors for the working-day;	999
	Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd	999
	With rainy marching in the painful field;	999
	There's not a piece of feather in our host--	999
	Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--	999
	And time hath worn us into slovenry:	999
	But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;	999
	And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night	999
	They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck	999
	The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads	999
	And turn them out of service. If they do this,--	999
	As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom then	999
	Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;	999
	Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:	999
	They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;	999
	Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,	999
	Shall yield them little, tell the constable.	999
	999
MONTJOY	I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:	999
	Thou never shalt hear herald any more.	999

	999

	999
PISTOL	O, Signieur Dew should be a gentleman:	999
	Perpend my words, O Signieur Dew, and mark;	999
	O Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox,	999
	Except, O signieur, thou do give to me	999
	Egregious ransom.	999
	999

	What is his name.	999
	999
Boy	Ecoutez: comment etes-vous appele?	999

Boy	He says his name is Master Fer.	999
	999
PISTOL	Master Fer! I'll fer him, and firk him, and ferret	999
	him: discuss the same in French unto him.	999
	999
Boy	I do not know the French for fer, and ferret, and firk.	999

	Peasant, unless thou give me crowns, brave crowns;	999
	Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.	999
	999
French Soldier	O, je vous supplie, pour l'amour de Dieu, me	999
	pardonner! Je suis gentilhomme de bonne maison:	999
	gardez ma vie, et je vous donnerai deux cents ecus.	999
	999
PISTOL	What are his words?	999
	999
Boy	He prays you to save his life: he is a gentleman of	999
	a good house; and for his ransom he will give you	999
	two hundred crowns.	999
	999
PISTOL	Tell him my fury shall abate, and I the crowns will take.	999
	999

	l'avez promis, il est content de vous donner la	999
	liberte, le franchisement.	999
	999
French Soldier	Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercimens; et	999
	je m'estime heureux que je suis tombe entre les	999
	mains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave,	999
	vaillant, et tres distingue seigneur d'Angleterre.	999
	999
PISTOL	Expound unto me, boy.	999
	999
Boy	He gives you, upon his knees, a thousand thanks; and	999
	he esteems himself happy that he hath fallen into	999
	the hands of one, as he thinks, the most brave,	999
	valorous, and thrice-worthy signieur of England.	999

	a wooden dagger; and they are both hanged; and so	999
	would this be, if he durst steal any thing	999
	adventurously. I must stay with the lackeys, with	999

KING HENRY V	Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen:	999
	But all's not done; yet keep the French the field.	999
	999
EXETER	The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Lives he, good uncle? thrice within this hour	999
	I saw him down; thrice up again and fighting;	999
	From helmet to the spur all blood he was.	999
	999
EXETER	In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,	999
	Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,	999
	Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,	999
	The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.	999
	Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,	999
	Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,	999
	And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes	999
	That bloodily did spawn upon his face;	999
	And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!	999
	My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;	999
	Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,	999
	As in this glorious and well-foughten field	999
	We kept together in our chivalry!'	999
	Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:	999
	He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,	999
	And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,	999
	Commend my service to me sovereign.'	999
	So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck	999
	He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;	999
	And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd	999
	A testament of noble-ending love.	999
	The pretty and sweet manner of it forced	999
	Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;	999
	But I had not so much of man in me,	999
	And all my mother came into mine eyes	999
	And gave me up to tears.	999

FLUELLEN	Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expressly	999
	against the law of arms: 'tis as arrant a piece of	999
	knavery, mark you now, as can be offer't; in your	999
	conscience, now, is it not?	999
	999
GOWER	'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the	999
	cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done	999
	this slaughter: besides, they have burned and	999
	carried away all that was in the king's tent;	999
	wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused every	999
	soldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis a	999
	gallant king!	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What	999
	call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born!	999
	999
GOWER	Alexander the Great.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Why, I pray you, is not pig great? the pig, or the	999
	great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the	999
	magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phrase	999
	is a little variations.	999
	999
GOWER	I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; his	999
	father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I	999
	tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the	999
	'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons	999
	between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations,	999
	look you, is both alike. There is a river in	999
	Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at	999
	Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is	999
	out of my prains what is the name of the other	999
	river; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers is	999
	to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you	999
	mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life	999
	is come after it indifferent well; for there is	999
	figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and	999
	you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his	999
	wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his	999
	displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a	999
	little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and	999
	his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.	999
	999
GOWER	Our king is not like him in that: he never killed	999
	any of his friends.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	It is not well done, mark you now take the tales out	999
	of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak	999
	but in the figures and comparisons of it: as	999
	Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his	999
	ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in	999
	his right wits and his good judgments, turned away	999
	the fat knight with the great belly-doublet: he	999
	was full of jests, and gipes, and knaveries, and	999
	mocks; I have forgot his name.	999
	999
GOWER	Sir John Falstaff.	999

	999
EXETER	Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	His eyes are humbler than they used to be.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou not	999
	That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?	999
	Comest thou again for ransom?	999
	999
MONTJOY	No, great king:	999
	I come to thee for charitable licence,	999
	That we may wander o'er this bloody field	999
	To look our dead, and then to bury them;	999
	To sort our nobles from our common men.	999
	For many of our princes--woe the while!--	999
	Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;	999
	So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs	999
	In blood of princes; and their wounded steeds	999
	Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage	999
	Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,	999
	Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,	999
	To view the field in safety and dispose	999
	Of their dead bodies!	999
	999
KING HENRY V	I tell thee truly, herald,	999
	I know not if the day be ours or no;	999
	For yet a many of your horsemen peer	999
	And gallop o'er the field.	999
	999
MONTJOY	The day is yours.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!	999
	What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?	999
	999
MONTJOY	They call it Agincourt.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Then call we this the field of Agincourt,	999
	Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please your	999
	majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Plack	999
	Prince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles,	999
	fought a most prave pattle here in France.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	They did, Fluellen.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Your majesty says very true: if your majesties is	999
	remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a	999
	garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their	999
	Monmouth caps; which, your majesty know, to this	999
	hour is an honourable badge of the service; and I do	999
	believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek	999
	upon Saint Tavy's day.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	I wear it for a memorable honour;	999
	For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	All the water in Wye cannot wash your majesty's	999
	Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that:	999
	God pless it and preserve it, as long as it pleases	999
	his grace, and his majesty too!	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Thanks, good my countryman.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	By Jeshu, I am your majesty's countryman, I care not	999
	who know it; I will confess it to all the 'orld: I	999
	need not to be ashamed of your majesty, praised be	999
	God, so long as your majesty is an honest man.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	God keep me so! Our heralds go with him:	999
	Bring me just notice of the numbers dead	999
	On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.	999
	999
	[Points to WILLIAMS. Exeunt Heralds with Montjoy]	999
	999
EXETER	Soldier, you must come to the king.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Soldier, why wearest thou that glove in thy cap?	999
	999
WILLIAMS	An't please your majesty, 'tis the gage of one that	999
	I should fight withal, if he be alive.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	An Englishman?	999
	999
WILLIAMS	An't please your majesty, a rascal that swaggered	999
	with me last night; who, if alive and ever dare to	999
	challenge this glove, I have sworn to take him a box	999
	o' th' ear: or if I can see my glove in his cap,	999
	which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would wear	999
	if alive, I will strike it out soundly.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	What think you, Captain Fluellen? is it fit this	999
	soldier keep his oath?	999
	999
FLUELLEN	He is a craven and a villain else, an't please your	999
	majesty, in my conscience.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort,	999
	quite from the answer of his degree.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as	999
	Lucifer and Belzebub himself, it is necessary, look	999
	your grace, that he keep his vow and his oath: if	999
	he be perjured, see you now, his reputation is as	999
	arrant a villain and a Jacksauce, as ever his black	999
	shoe trod upon God's ground and his earth, in my	999
	conscience, la!	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meetest the fellow.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	So I will, my liege, as I live.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Who servest thou under?	999
	999
WILLIAMS	Under Captain Gower, my liege.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge and	999
	literatured in the wars.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Call him hither to me, soldier.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	I will, my liege.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Here, Fluellen; wear thou this favour for me and	999
	stick it in thy cap: when Alencon and myself were	999
	down together, I plucked this glove from his helm:	999
	if any man challenge this, he is a friend to	999
	Alencon, and an enemy to our person; if thou	999
	encounter any such, apprehend him, an thou dost me love.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Your grace doo's me as great honours as can be	999
	desired in the hearts of his subjects: I would fain	999
	see the man, that has but two legs, that shall find	999
	himself aggrieved at this glove; that is all; but I	999
	would fain see it once, an please God of his grace	999
	that I might see.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Knowest thou Gower?	999
	999
FLUELLEN	He is my dear friend, an please you.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	I will fetch him.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING HENRY V	My Lord of Warwick, and my brother Gloucester,	999
	Follow Fluellen closely at the heels:	999
	The glove which I have given him for a favour	999
	May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear;	999
	It is the soldier's; I by bargain should	999
	Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick:	999
	If that the soldier strike him, as I judge	999
	By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,	999
	Some sudden mischief may arise of it;	999
	For I do know Fluellen valiant	999
	And, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder,	999
	And quickly will return an injury:	999
	Follow and see there be no harm between them.	999
	Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.	999

	999
	[Enter FLUELLEN]	999
	999
FLUELLEN	God's will and his pleasure, captain, I beseech you	999
	now, come apace to the king: there is more good	999
	toward you peradventure than is in your knowledge to dream of.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	Sir, know you this glove?	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Know the glove! I know the glove is glove.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	I know this; and thus I challenge it.	999
	999
	[Strikes him]	999
	999
FLUELLEN	'Sblood! an arrant traitor as any is in the	999
	universal world, or in France, or in England!	999
	999
GOWER	How now, sir! you villain!	999
	999
WILLIAMS	Do you think I'll be forsworn?	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Stand away, Captain Gower; I will give treason his	999
	payment into ploughs, I warrant you.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	I am no traitor.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	That's a lie in thy throat. I charge you in his	999
	majesty's name, apprehend him: he's a friend of the	999
	Duke Alencon's.	999
	999
	[Enter WARWICK and GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
WARWICK	How now, how now! what's the matter?	999
	999
FLUELLEN	My Lord of Warwick, here is--praised be God for it!	999
	--a most contagious treason come to light, look	999
	you, as you shall desire in a summer's day. Here is	999
	his majesty.	999
	999
	[Enter KING HENRY and EXETER]	999
	999
KING HENRY V	How now! what's the matter?	999
	999
FLUELLEN	My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that,	999
	look your grace, has struck the glove which your	999
	majesty is take out of the helmet of Alencon.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow of	999
	it; and he that I gave it to in change promised to	999
	wear it in his cap: I promised to strike him, if he	999
	did: I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I	999
	have been as good as my word.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Your majesty hear now, saving your majesty's	999
	manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousy	999
	knave it is: I hope your majesty is pear me	999
	testimony and witness, and will avouchment, that	999
	this is the glove of Alencon, that your majesty is	999
	give me; in your conscience, now?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Give me thy glove, soldier: look, here is the	999
	fellow of it.	999
	'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike;	999
	And thou hast given me most bitter terms.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	An please your majesty, let his neck answer for it,	999
	if there is any martial law in the world.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	How canst thou make me satisfaction?	999
	999
WILLIAMS	All offences, my lord, come from the heart: never	999
	came any from mine that might offend your majesty.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	It was ourself thou didst abuse.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	Your majesty came not like yourself: you appeared to	999
	me but as a common man; witness the night, your	999
	garments, your lowliness; and what your highness	999
	suffered under that shape, I beseech you take it for	999
	your own fault and not mine: for had you been as I	999
	took you for, I made no offence; therefore, I	999
	beseech your highness, pardon me.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns,	999
	And give it to this fellow. Keep it, fellow;	999
	And wear it for an honour in thy cap	999
	Till I do challenge it. Give him the crowns:	999
	And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	By this day and this light, the fellow has mettle	999
	enough in his belly. Hold, there is twelve pence	999
	for you; and I pray you to serve Got, and keep you	999
	out of prawls, and prabbles' and quarrels, and	999
	dissensions, and, I warrant you, it is the better for you.	999
	999
WILLIAMS	I will none of your money.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	It is with a good will; I can tell you, it will	999
	serve you to mend your shoes: come, wherefore should	999
	you be so pashful? your shoes is not so good: 'tis	999
	a good silling, I warrant you, or I will change it.	999
	999
	[Enter an English Herald]	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Now, herald, are the dead number'd?	999
	999
Herald	Here is the number of the slaughter'd French.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	What prisoners of good sort are taken, uncle?	999
	999
EXETER	Charles Duke of Orleans, nephew to the king;	999
	John Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt:	999
	Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,	999
	Full fifteen hundred, besides common men.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	This note doth tell me of ten thousand French	999
	That in the field lie slain: of princes, in this number,	999
	And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead	999
	One hundred twenty six: added to these,	999
	Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,	999
	Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,	999
	Five hundred were but yesterday dubb'd knights:	999
	So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,	999
	There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries;	999
	The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,	999
	And gentlemen of blood and quality.	999
	The names of those their nobles that lie dead:	999
	Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;	999
	Jaques of Chatillon, admiral of France;	999
	The master of the cross-bows, Lord Rambures;	999
	Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dolphin,	999
	John Duke of Alencon, Anthony Duke of Brabant,	999
	The brother of the Duke of Burgundy,	999
	And Edward Duke of Bar: of lusty earls,	999
	Grandpre and Roussi, Fauconberg and Foix,	999
	Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.	999
	Here was a royal fellowship of death!	999
	Where is the number of our English dead?	999
	999
	[Herald shews him another paper]	999
	999
	Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,	999
	Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire:	999
	None else of name; and of all other men	999
	But five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here;	999
	And not to us, but to thy arm alone,	999
	Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem,	999
	But in plain shock and even play of battle,	999
	Was ever known so great and little loss	999
	On one part and on the other? Take it, God,	999
	For it is none but thine!	999
	999
EXETER	'Tis wonderful!	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Come, go we in procession to the village.	999
	And be it death proclaimed through our host	999
	To boast of this or take the praise from God	999
	Which is his only.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Is it not lawful, an please your majesty, to tell	999
	how many is killed?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Yes, captain; but with this acknowledgement,	999
	That God fought for us.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Yes, my conscience, he did us great good.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Do we all holy rites;	999
	Let there be sung 'Non nobis' and 'Te Deum;'	999
	The dead with charity enclosed in clay:	999

	[Enter Chorus]	999
	999
Chorus	Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,	999
	That I may prompt them: and of such as have,	999
	I humbly pray them to admit the excuse	999
	Of time, of numbers and due course of things,	999
	Which cannot in their huge and proper life	999
	Be here presented. Now we bear the king	999
	Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen,	999
	Heave him away upon your winged thoughts	999
	Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach	999
	Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,	999
	Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth'd sea,	999
	Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king	999
	Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,	999
	And solemnly see him set on to London.	999
	So swift a pace hath thought that even now	999
	You may imagine him upon Blackheath;	999
	Where that his lords desire him to have borne	999
	His bruised helmet and his bended sword	999
	Before him through the city: he forbids it,	999
	Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;	999
	Giving full trophy, signal and ostent	999
	Quite from himself to God. But now behold,	999
	In the quick forge and working-house of thought,	999
	How London doth pour out her citizens!	999
	The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,	999
	Like to the senators of the antique Rome,	999
	With the plebeians swarming at their heels,	999
	Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in:	999
	As, by a lower but loving likelihood,	999
	Were now the general of our gracious empress,	999
	As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,	999
	Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,	999
	How many would the peaceful city quit,	999
	To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,	999
	Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;	999
	As yet the lamentation of the French	999
	Invites the King of England's stay at home;	999
	The emperor's coming in behalf of France,	999
	To order peace between them; and omit	999
	All the occurrences, whatever chanced,	999
	Till Harry's back-return again to France:	999
	There must we bring him; and myself have play'd	999
	The interim, by remembering you 'tis past.	999
	Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,	999

	Saint Davy's day is past.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in	999
	all things: I will tell you, asse my friend,	999
	Captain Gower: the rascally, scald, beggarly,	999
	lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and	999
	yourself and all the world know to be no petter	999
	than a fellow, look you now, of no merits, he is	999
	come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday,	999
	look you, and bid me eat my leek: it was in place	999
	where I could not breed no contention with him; but	999
	I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see	999
	him once again, and then I will tell him a little	999
	piece of my desires.	999

PISTOL	Ha! art thou bedlam? dost thou thirst, base Trojan,	999
	To have me fold up Parca's fatal web?	999
	Hence! I am qualmish at the smell of leek.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	I peseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave, at my	999
	desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eat,	999
	look you, this leek: because, look you, you do not	999
	love it, nor your affections and your appetites and	999
	your digestions doo's not agree with it, I would	999
	desire you to eat it.	999
	999
PISTOL	Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	There is one goat for you.	999
	999

	999
	Will you be so good, scauld knave, as eat it?	999
	999
PISTOL	Base Trojan, thou shalt die.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	You say very true, scauld knave, when God's will is:	999
	I will desire you to live in the mean time, and eat	999
	your victuals: come, there is sauce for it.	999
	999
	[Strikes him]	999
	999
	You called me yesterday mountain-squire; but I will	999
	make you to-day a squire of low degree. I pray you,	999
	fall to: if you can mock a leek, you can eat a leek.	999
	999
GOWER	Enough, captain: you have astonished him.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	I say, I will make him eat some part of my leek, or	999
	I will peat his pate four days. Bite, I pray you; it	999
	is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb.	999
	999
PISTOL	Must I bite?	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of question	999
	too, and ambiguities.	999
	999
PISTOL	By this leek, I will most horribly revenge: I eat	999
	and eat, I swear--	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Eat, I pray you: will you have some more sauce to	999
	your leek? there is not enough leek to swear by.	999
	999
PISTOL	Quiet thy cudgel; thou dost see I eat.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Much good do you, scauld knave, heartily. Nay, pray	999
	you, throw none away; the skin is good for your	999
	broken coxcomb. When you take occasions to see leeks	999
	hereafter, I pray you, mock at 'em; that is all.	999
	999
PISTOL	Good.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Ay, leeks is good: hold you, there is a groat to	999
	heal your pate.	999
	999
PISTOL	Me a groat!	999
	999
FLUELLEN	Yes, verily and in truth, you shall take it; or I	999
	have another leek in my pocket, which you shall eat.	999
	999
PISTOL	I take thy groat in earnest of revenge.	999
	999
FLUELLEN	If I owe you any thing, I will pay you in cudgels:	999
	you shall be a woodmonger, and buy nothing of me but	999
	cudgels. God b' wi' you, and keep you, and heal your pate.	999

GOWER	Go, go; you are a counterfeit cowardly knave. Will	999
	you mock at an ancient tradition, begun upon an	999
	honourable respect, and worn as a memorable trophy of	999
	predeceased valour and dare not avouch in your deeds	999
	any of your words? I have seen you gleeking and	999
	galling at this gentleman twice or thrice. You	999
	thought, because he could not speak English in the	999
	native garb, he could not therefore handle an	999
	English cudgel: you find it otherwise; and	999
	henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good	999
	English condition. Fare ye well.	999

PISTOL	Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now?	999
	News have I, that my Nell is dead i' the spital	999
	Of malady of France;	999
	And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.	999
	Old I do wax; and from my weary limbs	999
	Honour is cudgelled. Well, bawd I'll turn,	999
	And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.	999
	To England will I steal, and there I'll steal:	999
	And patches will I get unto these cudgell'd scars,	999
	And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.	999

	999
SCENE II	France. A royal palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter, at one door KING HENRY, EXETER, BEDFORD,	999
	GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and other Lords;	999
	at another, the FRENCH KING, QUEEN ISABEL, the	999
	PRINCESS KATHARINE, ALICE and other Ladies; the	999
	DUKE of BURGUNDY, and his train]	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met!	999
	Unto our brother France, and to our sister,	999
	Health and fair time of day; joy and good wishes	999
	To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine;	999
	And, as a branch and member of this royalty,	999
	By whom this great assembly is contrived,	999
	We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy;	999
	And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	Right joyous are we to behold your face,	999
	Most worthy brother England; fairly met:	999
	So are you, princes English, every one.	999
	999
QUEEN ISABEL	So happy be the issue, brother England,	999
	Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,	999
	As we are now glad to behold your eyes;	999
	Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them	999
	Against the French, that met them in their bent,	999
	The fatal balls of murdering basilisks:	999
	The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,	999
	Have lost their quality, and that this day	999
	Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	To cry amen to that, thus we appear.	999
	999
QUEEN ISABEL	You English princes all, I do salute you.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	My duty to you both, on equal love,	999
	Great Kings of France and England! That I have labour'd,	999
	With all my wits, my pains and strong endeavours,	999
	To bring your most imperial majesties	999
	Unto this bar and royal interview,	999
	Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.	999
	Since then my office hath so far prevail'd	999
	That, face to face and royal eye to eye,	999
	You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,	999
	If I demand, before this royal view,	999
	What rub or what impediment there is,	999
	Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,	999
	Dear nurse of arts and joyful births,	999
	Should not in this best garden of the world	999
	Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?	999
	Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,	999
	And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,	999
	Corrupting in its own fertility.	999
	Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,	999
	Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd,	999
	Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,	999
	Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leas	999
	The darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory	999
	Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts	999
	That should deracinate such savagery;	999
	The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth	999
	The freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover,	999
	Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,	999
	Conceives by idleness and nothing teems	999
	But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,	999
	Losing both beauty and utility.	999
	And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges,	999
	Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,	999
	Even so our houses and ourselves and children	999
	Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,	999
	The sciences that should become our country;	999
	But grow like savages,--as soldiers will	999
	That nothing do but meditate on blood,--	999
	To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire	999
	And every thing that seems unnatural.	999
	Which to reduce into our former favour	999
	You are assembled: and my speech entreats	999
	That I may know the let, why gentle Peace	999
	Should not expel these inconveniences	999
	And bless us with her former qualities.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,	999
	Whose want gives growth to the imperfections	999
	Which you have cited, you must buy that peace	999
	With full accord to all our just demands;	999
	Whose tenors and particular effects	999
	You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	The king hath heard them; to the which as yet	999
	There is no answer made.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Well then the peace,	999
	Which you before so urged, lies in his answer.	999
	999
KING OF FRANCE	I have but with a cursorary eye	999
	O'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your grace	999
	To appoint some of your council presently	999
	To sit with us once more, with better heed	999
	To re-survey them, we will suddenly	999
	Pass our accept and peremptory answer.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Brother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,	999
	And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,	999
	Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king;	999
	And take with you free power to ratify,	999
	Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best	999
	Shall see advantageable for our dignity,	999
	Any thing in or out of our demands,	999
	And we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,	999
	Go with the princes, or stay here with us?	999
	999
QUEEN ISABEL	Our gracious brother, I will go with them:	999
	Haply a woman's voice may do some good,	999
	When articles too nicely urged be stood on.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:	999
	She is our capital demand, comprised	999
	Within the fore-rank of our articles.	999
	999
QUEEN ISABEL	She hath good leave.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all except HENRY, KATHARINE, and ALICE]	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Fair Katharine, and most fair,	999
	Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms	999
	Such as will enter at a lady's ear	999
	And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?	999
	999
KATHARINE	Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with	999
	your French heart, I will be glad to hear you	999
	confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do	999
	you like me, Kate?	999
	999
KATHARINE	Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is 'like me.'	999
	999
KING HENRY V	An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?	999
	999
ALICE	Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	I said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush to	999
	affirm it.	999
	999
KATHARINE	O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de	999
	tromperies.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men	999
	are full of deceits?	999
	999
ALICE	Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of	999
	deceits: dat is de princess.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,	999
	Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am	999
	glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if	999
	thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king	999
	that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my	999
	crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but	999
	directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me	999
	farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out	999
	my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and so	999
	clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?	999
	999
KATHARINE	Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for	999
	your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I	999
	have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I	999
	have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable	999
	measure in strength. If I could win a lady at	999
	leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my	999
	armour on my back, under the correction of bragging	999
	be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.	999
	Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse	999
	for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and	999
	sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,	999
	Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my	999
	eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;	999
	only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,	999
	nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a	999
	fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth	999
	sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love	999
	of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy	999
	cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst	999
	love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee	999
	that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the	999
	Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou	999
	livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and	999
	uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee	999
	right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other	999
	places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that	999
	can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do	999
	always reason themselves out again. What! a	999
	speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A	999
	good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a	999
	black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow	999
	bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax	999
	hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the	999
	moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it	999
	shines bright and never changes, but keeps his	999
	course truly. If thou would have such a one, take	999
	me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,	999
	take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?	999
	speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of	999
	France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love	999
	the friend of France; for I love France so well that	999
	I will not part with a village of it; I will have it	999
	all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am	999
	yours, then yours is France and you are mine.	999
	999
KATHARINE	I cannot tell vat is dat.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am	999
	sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married	999
	wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook	999
	off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand	999
	vous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, what	999
	then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est	999
	France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,	999
	Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much	999
	more French: I shall never move thee in French,	999
	unless it be to laugh at me.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il	999
	est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my	999
	tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs	999
	be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou	999
	understand thus much English, canst thou love me?	999
	999
KATHARINE	I cannot tell.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask	999
	them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,	999
	when you come into your closet, you'll question this	999
	gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to	999
	her dispraise those parts in me that you love with	999
	your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the	999
	rather, gentle princess, because I love thee	999
	cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a	999
	saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get	999
	thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs	999
	prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,	999
	between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a	999
	boy, half French, half English, that shall go to	999
	Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?	999
	shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair	999
	flower-de-luce?	999
	999
KATHARINE	I do not know dat	999
	999
KING HENRY V	No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do	999
	but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your	999
	French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety	999
	take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer	999
	you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher	999
	et devin deesse?	999
	999
KATHARINE	Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de	999
	most sage demoiselle dat is en France.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in	999
	true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I	999
	dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to	999
	flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor	999
	and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew	999
	my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars	999
	when he got me: therefore was I created with a	999
	stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when	999
	I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,	999
	Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:	999
	my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of	999
	beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou	999
	hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou	999
	shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:	999
	and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you	999
	have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the	999
	thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;	999
	take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am	999
	thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine	999
	ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England is	999
	thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry	999
	Plantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it before	999
	his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,	999
	thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.	999
	Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is	999
	music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of	999
	all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken	999
	English; wilt thou have me?	999
	999
KATHARINE	Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Nay, it will please him well, Kate it shall please	999
	him, Kate.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Den it sall also content me.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi, je	999
	ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en	999
	baisant la main d'une de votre seigeurie indigne	999
	serviteur; excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon	999
	tres-puissant seigneur.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant	999
	leur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Madam my interpreter, what says she?	999
	999
ALICE	Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of	999
	France,--I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	To kiss.	999
	999
ALICE	Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss	999
	before they are married, would she say?	999
	999
ALICE	Oui, vraiment.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear	999
	Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak	999
	list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of	999
	manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our	999
	places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will	999
	do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your	999
	country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently	999
	and yielding.	999
	999
	[Kissing her]	999
	999
	You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is	999
	more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the	999
	tongues of the French council; and they should	999
	sooner persuade Harry of England than a general	999
	petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.	999
	999
	[Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY,	999
	and other Lords]	999
	999
BURGUNDY	God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach you	999
	our princess English?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how	999
	perfectly I love her; and that is good English.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Is she not apt?	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not	999
	smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the	999
	heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up	999
	the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in	999
	his true likeness.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you	999
	for that. If you would conjure in her, you must	999
	make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true	999
	likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you	999
	blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the	999
	virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the	999
	appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing	999
	self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid	999
	to consign to.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	They are then excused, my lord, when they see not	999
	what they do.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will	999
	teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well	999
	summered and warm kept, are like flies at	999
	Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their	999
	eyes; and then they will endure handling, which	999
	before would not abide looking on.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer;	999
	and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the	999
	latter end and she must be blind too.	999
	999
BURGUNDY	As love is, my lord, before it loves.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	It is so: and you may, some of you, thank love for	999
	my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city	999
	for one fair French maid that stands in my way.	999
	999
FRENCH KING	Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities	999
	turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with	999
	maiden walls that war hath never entered.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Shall Kate be my wife?	999
	999
FRENCH KING	So please you.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	I am content; so the maiden cities you talk of may	999
	wait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for	999
	my wish shall show me the way to my will.	999
	999
FRENCH KING	We have consented to all terms of reason.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Is't so, my lords of England?	999
	999
WESTMORELAND	The king hath granted every article:	999
	His daughter first, and then in sequel all,	999
	According to their firm proposed natures.	999
	999
EXETER	Only he hath not yet subscribed this:	999
	Where your majesty demands, that the King of France,	999
	having any occasion to write for matter of grant,	999
	shall name your highness in this form and with this	999
	addition in French, Notre trescher fils Henri, Roi	999
	d'Angleterre, Heritier de France; and thus in	999
	Latin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex	999
	Angliae, et Haeres Franciae.	999
	999
FRENCH KING	Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,	999
	But your request shall make me let it pass.	999
	999
KING HENRY V	I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,	999
	Let that one article rank with the rest;	999
	And thereupon give me your daughter.	999
	999
FRENCH KING	Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up	999
	Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms	999
	Of France and England, whose very shores look pale	999
	With envy of each other's happiness,	999
	May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction	999
	Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord	999
	In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance	999
	His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.	999
	999
ALL	Amen!	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,	999
	That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.	999
	999
	[Flourish]	999
	999
QUEEN ISABEL	God, the best maker of all marriages,	999
	Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!	999
	As man and wife, being two, are one in love,	999
	So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,	999
	That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,	999
	Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,	999
	Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,	999
	To make divorce of their incorporate league;	999
	That English may as French, French Englishmen,	999
	Receive each other. God speak this Amen!	999
	999
ALL	Amen!	999
	999
KING HENRY V	Prepare we for our marriage--on which day,	999
	My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,	999
	And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.	999
	Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me;	999
	And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!	999

	[Enter Chorus]	999
	999
Chorus	Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen,	999
	Our bending author hath pursued the story,	999
	In little room confining mighty men,	999
	Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.	999
	Small time, but in that small most greatly lived	999
	This star of England: Fortune made his sword;	999
	By which the world's best garden be achieved,	999
	And of it left his son imperial lord.	999
	Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crown'd King	999
	Of France and England, did this king succeed;	999
	Whose state so many had the managing,	999
	That they lost France and made his England bleed:	999
	Which oft our stage hath shown; and, for their sake,	999
	In your fair minds let this acceptance take.	999

	THE PROLOGUE	999
	999
	999
	I come no more to make you laugh: things now,	999
	That bear a weighty and a serious brow,	999
	Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,	999
	Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,	999
	We now present. Those that can pity, here	999
	May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;	999
	The subject will deserve it. Such as give	999
	Their money out of hope they may believe,	999
	May here find truth too. Those that come to see	999
	Only a show or two, and so agree	999
	The play may pass, if they be still and willing,	999
	I'll undertake may see away their shilling	999
	Richly in two short hours. Only they	999
	That come to hear a merry bawdy play,	999
	A noise of targets, or to see a fellow	999
	In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,	999
	Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,	999
	To rank our chosen truth with such a show	999
	As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting	999
	Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,	999
	To make that only true we now intend,	999
	Will leave us never an understanding friend.	999
	Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known	999
	The first and happiest hearers of the town,	999
	Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see	999
	The very persons of our noble story	999
	As they were living; think you see them great,	999
	And follow'd with the general throng and sweat	999
	Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see	999
	How soon this mightiness meets misery:	999
	And, if you can be merry then, I'll say	999
	A man may weep upon his wedding-day.	999

	999
ACT I	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	London. An ante-chamber in the palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other, BUCKINGHAM	999
	and ABERGAVENNY]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done	999
	Since last we saw in France?	999
	999
NORFOLK	I thank your grace,	999
	Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer	999
	Of what I saw there.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	An untimely ague	999
	Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when	999
	Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,	999
	Met in the vale of Andren.	999
	999
NORFOLK	'Twixt Guynes and Arde:	999
	I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;	999
	Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung	999
	In their embracement, as they grew together;	999
	Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd	999
	Such a compounded one?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	All the whole time	999
	I was my chamber's prisoner.	999
	999
NORFOLK	Then you lost	999
	The view of earthly glory: men might say,	999
	Till this time pomp was single, but now married	999
	To one above itself. Each following day	999
	Became the next day's master, till the last	999
	Made former wonders its. To-day the French,	999
	All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,	999
	Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they	999
	Made Britain India: every man that stood	999
	Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were	999
	As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,	999
	Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear	999
	The pride upon them, that their very labour	999
	Was to them as a painting: now this masque	999
	Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night	999
	Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,	999
	Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,	999
	As presence did present them; him in eye,	999
	Still him in praise: and, being present both	999
	'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner	999
	Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--	999
	For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged	999
	The noble spirits to arms, they did perform	999
	Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,	999
	Being now seen possible enough, got credit,	999
	That Bevis was believed.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	O, you go far.	999
	999
NORFOLK	As I belong to worship and affect	999
	In honour honesty, the tract of every thing	999
	Would by a good discourser lose some life,	999
	Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;	999
	To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.	999
	Order gave each thing view; the office did	999
	Distinctly his full function.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Who did guide,	999
	I mean, who set the body and the limbs	999
	Of this great sport together, as you guess?	999
	999
NORFOLK	One, certes, that promises no element	999
	In such a business.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	I pray you, who, my lord?	999
	999
NORFOLK	All this was order'd by the good discretion	999
	Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed	999
	From his ambitious finger. What had he	999
	To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder	999
	That such a keech can with his very bulk	999
	Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun	999
	And keep it from the earth.	999
	999
NORFOLK	Surely, sir,	999
	There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;	999
	For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace	999
	Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon	999
	For high feats done to the crown; neither allied	999
	For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,	999
	Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,	999
	The force of his own merit makes his way	999
	A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys	999
	A place next to the king.	999
	999
ABERGAVENNY	I cannot tell	999
	What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye	999
	Pierce into that; but I can see his pride	999
	Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,	999
	If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,	999
	Or has given all before, and he begins	999
	A new hell in himself.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Why the devil,	999
	Upon this French going out, took he upon him,	999
	Without the privity o' the king, to appoint	999
	Who should attend on him? He makes up the file	999
	Of all the gentry; for the most part such	999
	To whom as great a charge as little honour	999
	He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,	999
	The honourable board of council out,	999
	Must fetch him in the papers.	999
	999
ABERGAVENNY	I do know	999
	Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have	999
	By this so sickened their estates, that never	999
	They shall abound as formerly.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	O, many	999
	Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em	999
	For this great journey. What did this vanity	999
	But minister communication of	999
	A most poor issue?	999
	999
NORFOLK	                  Grievingly I think,	999
	The peace between the French and us not values	999
	The cost that did conclude it.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Every man,	999
	After the hideous storm that follow'd, was	999
	A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke	999
	Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,	999
	Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded	999
	The sudden breach on't.	999
	999
NORFOLK	Which is budded out;	999
	For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd	999
	Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.	999
	999
ABERGAVENNY	Is it therefore	999
	The ambassador is silenced?	999
	999
NORFOLK	Marry, is't.	999
	999
ABERGAVENNY	A proper title of a peace; and purchased	999
	At a superfluous rate!	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Why, all this business	999
	Our reverend cardinal carried.	999
	999
NORFOLK	Like it your grace,	999
	The state takes notice of the private difference	999
	Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--	999
	And take it from a heart that wishes towards you	999
	Honour and plenteous safety--that you read	999
	The cardinal's malice and his potency	999
	Together; to consider further that	999
	What his high hatred would effect wants not	999
	A minister in his power. You know his nature,	999
	That he's revengeful, and I know his sword	999
	Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,	999
	It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,	999
	Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,	999
	You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock	999
	That I advise your shunning.	999
	999
	[Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him,	999
	certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with	999
	papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his	999
	eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full	999
	of disdain]	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?	999
	Where's his examination?	999
	999
First Secretary	Here, so please you.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Is he in person ready?	999
	999
First Secretary	Ay, please your grace.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham	999
	Shall lessen this big look.	999
	999
	[Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I	999
	Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best	999
	Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book	999
	Outworths a noble's blood.	999
	999
NORFOLK	What, are you chafed?	999
	Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only	999
	Which your disease requires.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	I read in's looks	999
	Matter against me; and his eye reviled	999
	Me, as his abject object: at this instant	999
	He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;	999
	I'll follow and outstare him.	999
	999
NORFOLK	Stay, my lord,	999
	And let your reason with your choler question	999
	What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills	999
	Requires slow pace at first: anger is like	999
	A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,	999
	Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England	999
	Can advise me like you: be to yourself	999
	As you would to your friend.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	I'll to the king;	999
	And from a mouth of honour quite cry down	999
	This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim	999
	There's difference in no persons.	999
	999
NORFOLK	Be advised;	999
	Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot	999
	That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,	999
	By violent swiftness, that which we run at,	999
	And lose by over-running. Know you not,	999
	The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,	999
	In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:	999
	I say again, there is no English soul	999
	More stronger to direct you than yourself,	999
	If with the sap of reason you would quench,	999
	Or but allay, the fire of passion.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Sir,	999
	I am thankful to you; and I'll go along	999
	By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,	999
	Whom from the flow of gall I name not but	999
	From sincere motions, by intelligence,	999
	And proofs as clear as founts in July when	999
	We see each grain of gravel, I do know	999
	To be corrupt and treasonous.	999
	999
NORFOLK	Say not 'treasonous.'	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong	999
	As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,	999
	Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous	999
	As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief	999
	As able to perform't; his mind and place	999
	Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--	999
	Only to show his pomp as well in France	999
	As here at home, suggests the king our master	999
	To this last costly treaty, the interview,	999
	That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass	999
	Did break i' the rinsing.	999
	999
NORFOLK	Faith, and so it did.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal	999
	The articles o' the combination drew	999
	As himself pleased; and they were ratified	999
	As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end	999
	As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal	999
	Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,	999
	Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--	999
	Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy	999
	To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,	999
	Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--	999
	For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came	999
	To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:	999
	His fears were, that the interview betwixt	999
	England and France might, through their amity,	999
	Breed him some prejudice; for from this league	999
	Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily	999
	Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--	999
	Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor	999
	Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted	999
	Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,	999
	And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,	999
	That he would please to alter the king's course,	999
	And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,	999
	As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal	999
	Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,	999
	And for his own advantage.	999
	999
NORFOLK	I am sorry	999
	To hear this of him; and could wish he were	999
	Something mistaken in't.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	No, not a syllable:	999
	I  do pronounce him in that very shape	999
	He shall appear in proof.	999
	999
	[Enter BRANDON, a Sergeant-at-arms before him, and	999
	two or three of the Guard]	999
	999
BRANDON	Your office, sergeant; execute it.	999
	999
Sergeant	Sir,	999
	My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl	999
	Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I	999
	Arrest thee of high treason, in the name	999
	Of our most sovereign king.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Lo, you, my lord,	999
	The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish	999
	Under device and practise.	999
	999
BRANDON	I am sorry	999
	To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on	999
	The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure	999
	You shall to the Tower.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	It will help me nothing	999
	To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me	999
	Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven	999
	Be done in this and all things! I obey.	999
	O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!	999
	999
BRANDON	Nay, he must bear you company. The king	999
	999
	[To ABERGAVENNY]	999
	999
	Is pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know	999
	How he determines further.	999
	999
ABERGAVENNY	As the duke said,	999
	The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasure	999
	By me obey'd!	999
	999
BRANDON	                  Here is a warrant from	999
	The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies	999
	Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,	999
	One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor--	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	So, so;	999
	These are the limbs o' the plot: no more, I hope.	999
	999
BRANDON	A monk o' the Chartreux.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	O, Nicholas Hopkins?	999
	999
BRANDON	He.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	My surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinal	999
	Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already:	999

	That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person	999
	I'll hear him his confessions justify;	999
	And point by point the treasons of his master	999
	He shall again relate.	999
	999
	[A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!' Enter	999
	QUEEN KATHARINE, ushered by NORFOLK, and SUFFOLK:	999
	she kneels. KING HENRY VIII riseth from his state,	999
	takes her up, kisses and placeth her by him]	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Arise, and take place by us: half your suit	999
	Never name to us; you have half our power:	999
	The other moiety, ere you ask, is given;	999
	Repeat your will and take it.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Thank your majesty.	999
	That you would love yourself, and in that love	999
	Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor	999
	The dignity of your office, is the point	999
	Of my petition.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	                  Lady mine, proceed.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	I am solicited, not by a few,	999
	And those of true condition, that your subjects	999
	Are in great grievance: there have been commissions	999
	Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart	999
	Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,	999
	My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches	999
	Most bitterly on you, as putter on	999
	Of these exactions, yet the king our master--	999
	Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he	999
	escapes not	999
	Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks	999
	The sides of loyalty, and almost appears	999
	In loud rebellion.	999
	999
NORFOLK	                  Not almost appears,	999
	It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,	999
	The clothiers all, not able to maintain	999
	The many to them longing, have put off	999
	The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,	999
	Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger	999
	And lack of other means, in desperate manner	999
	Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar,	999
	And danger serves among then!	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Taxation!	999
	Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal,	999
	You that are blamed for it alike with us,	999
	Know you of this taxation?	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Please you, sir,	999
	I know but of a single part, in aught	999
	Pertains to the state; and front but in that file	999
	Where others tell steps with me.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	No, my lord,	999
	You know no more than others; but you frame	999
	Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome	999
	To those which would not know them, and yet must	999
	Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,	999
	Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are	999
	Most pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear 'em,	999
	The back is sacrifice to the load. They say	999
	They are devised by you; or else you suffer	999
	Too hard an exclamation.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Still exaction!	999
	The nature of it? in what kind, let's know,	999
	Is this exaction?	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	                  I am much too venturous	999
	In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd	999
	Under your promised pardon. The subjects' grief	999
	Comes through commissions, which compel from each	999
	The sixth part of his substance, to be levied	999
	Without delay; and the pretence for this	999
	Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:	999
	Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze	999
	Allegiance in them; their curses now	999
	Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,	999
	This tractable obedience is a slave	999
	To each incensed will. I would your highness	999
	Would give it quick consideration, for	999
	There is no primer business.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	By my life,	999
	This is against our pleasure.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	And for me,	999
	I have no further gone in this than by	999
	A single voice; and that not pass'd me but	999
	By learned approbation of the judges. If I am	999
	Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know	999
	My faculties nor person, yet will be	999
	The chronicles of my doing, let me say	999
	'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake	999
	That virtue must go through. We must not stint	999
	Our necessary actions, in the fear	999
	To cope malicious censurers; which ever,	999
	As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow	999
	That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further	999
	Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,	999
	By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is	999
	Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,	999
	Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up	999
	For our best act. If we shall stand still,	999
	In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,	999
	We should take root here where we sit, or sit	999
	State-statues only.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Things done well,	999
	And with a care, exempt themselves from fear;	999
	Things done without example, in their issue	999
	Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent	999
	Of this commission? I believe, not any.	999
	We must not rend our subjects from our laws,	999
	And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?	999
	A trembling contribution! Why, we take	999
	From every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber;	999
	And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,	999
	The air will drink the sap. To every county	999
	Where this is question'd send our letters, with	999
	Free pardon to each man that has denied	999
	The force of this commission: pray, look to't;	999
	I put it to your care.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	A word with you.	999
	999
	[To the Secretary]	999
	999
	Let there be letters writ to every shire,	999
	Of the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commons	999
	Hardly conceive of me; let it be noised	999
	That through our intercession this revokement	999
	And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you	999
	Further in the proceeding.	999
	999
	[Exit Secretary]	999
	999
	[Enter Surveyor]	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham	999
	Is run in your displeasure.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	It grieves many:	999
	The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker;	999
	To nature none more bound; his training such,	999
	That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,	999
	And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,	999
	When these so noble benefits shall prove	999
	Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,	999
	They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly	999
	Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,	999
	Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,	999
	Almost with ravish'd listening, could not find	999
	His hour of speech a minute; he, my lady,	999
	Hath into monstrous habits put the graces	999
	That once were his, and is become as black	999
	As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear--	999
	This was his gentleman in trust--of him	999
	Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount	999
	The fore-recited practises; whereof	999
	We cannot feel too little, hear too much.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,	999
	Most like a careful subject, have collected	999
	Out of the Duke of Buckingham.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Speak freely.	999
	999
Surveyor	First, it was usual with him, every day	999
	It would infect his speech, that if the king	999
	Should without issue die, he'll carry it so	999
	To make the sceptre his: these very words	999
	I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,	999
	Lord Abergavenny; to whom by oath he menaced	999
	Revenge upon the cardinal.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Please your highness, note	999
	This dangerous conception in this point.	999
	Not friended by by his wish, to your high person	999
	His will is most malignant; and it stretches	999
	Beyond you, to your friends.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	My learn'd lord cardinal,	999
	Deliver all with charity.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Speak on:	999
	How grounded he his title to the crown,	999
	Upon our fail? to this point hast thou heard him	999
	At any time speak aught?	999
	999
Surveyor	He was brought to this	999
	By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	What was that Hopkins?	999
	999
Surveyor	Sir, a Chartreux friar,	999
	His confessor, who fed him every minute	999
	With words of sovereignty.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	How know'st thou this?	999
	999
Surveyor	Not long before your highness sped to France,	999
	The duke being at the Rose, within the parish	999
	Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand	999
	What was the speech among the Londoners	999
	Concerning the French journey: I replied,	999
	Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,	999
	To the king's danger. Presently the duke	999
	Said, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted	999
	'Twould prove the verity of certain words	999
	Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,	999
	'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit	999
	John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour	999
	To hear from him a matter of some moment:	999
	Whom after under the confession's seal	999
	He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke	999
	My chaplain to no creature living, but	999
	To me, should utter, with demure confidence	999
	This pausingly ensued: neither the king nor's heirs,	999
	Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive	999
	To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke	999
	Shall govern England.'	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	If I know you well,	999
	You were the duke's surveyor, and lost your office	999
	On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed	999
	You charge not in your spleen a noble person	999
	And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;	999
	Yes, heartily beseech you.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Let him on.	999
	Go forward.	999
	999
Surveyor	     On my soul, I'll speak but truth.	999
	I told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusions	999
	The monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him	999
	To ruminate on this so far, until	999
	It forged him some design, which, being believed,	999
	It was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush,	999
	It can do me no damage;' adding further,	999
	That, had the king in his last sickness fail'd,	999
	The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads	999
	Should have gone off.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!	999
	There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?	999
	999
Surveyor	I can, my liege.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	                  Proceed.	999
	999
Surveyor	Being at Greenwich,	999
	After your highness had reproved the duke	999
	About Sir William Blomer,--	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	I remember	999
	Of such a time: being my sworn servant,	999
	The duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence?	999
	999
Surveyor	'If,' quoth he, 'I for this had been committed,	999
	As, to the Tower, I thought, I would have play'd	999
	The part my father meant to act upon	999
	The usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,	999
	Made suit to come in's presence; which if granted,	999
	As he made semblance of his duty, would	999
	Have put his knife to him.'	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	A giant traitor!	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Now, madam, may his highness live in freedom,	999
	and this man out of prison?	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	God mend all!	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?	999
	999
Surveyor	After 'the duke his father,' with 'the knife,'	999
	He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,	999
	Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes	999
	He did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenor	999
	Was,--were he evil used, he would outgo	999
	His father by as much as a performance	999
	Does an irresolute purpose.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	There's his period,	999
	To sheathe his knife in us. He is attach'd;	999
	Call him to present trial: if he may	999
	Find mercy in the law, 'tis his: if none,	999
	Let him not seek 't of us: by day and night,	999
	He's traitor to the height.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter Chamberlain and SANDS]	999
	999
Chamberlain	Is't possible the spells of France should juggle	999
	Men into such strange mysteries?	999
	999
SANDS	New customs,	999
	Though they be never so ridiculous,	999
	Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.	999
	999
Chamberlain	As far as I see, all the good our English	999
	Have got by the late voyage is but merely	999
	A fit or two o' the face; but they are shrewd ones;	999
	For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly	999
	Their very noses had been counsellors	999
	To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.	999
	999
SANDS	They have all new legs, and lame ones: one would take it,	999
	That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin	999
	Or springhalt reign'd among 'em.	999
	999
Chamberlain	Death! my lord,	999
	Their clothes are after such a pagan cut too,	999
	That, sure, they've worn out Christendom.	999
	999
	[Enter LOVELL]	999
	999
		                  How now!	999
	What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?	999
	999
LOVELL	Faith, my lord,	999
	I hear of none, but the new proclamation	999
	That's clapp'd upon the court-gate.	999
	999
Chamberlain	What is't for?	999
	999
LOVELL	The reformation of our travell'd gallants,	999
	That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.	999
	999
Chamberlain	I'm glad 'tis there: now I would pray our monsieurs	999
	To think an English courtier may be wise,	999
	And never see the Louvre.	999
	999
LOVELL	They must either,	999
	For so run the conditions, leave those remnants	999
	Of fool and feather that they got in France,	999
	With all their honourable point of ignorance	999
	Pertaining thereunto, as fights and fireworks,	999
	Abusing better men than they can be,	999
	Out of a foreign wisdom, renouncing clean	999
	The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings,	999
	Short blister'd breeches, and those types of travel,	999
	And understand again like honest men;	999
	Or pack to their old playfellows: there, I take it,	999
	They may, 'cum privilegio,' wear away	999
	The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at.	999
	999
SANDS	'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases	999
	Are grown so catching.	999
	999
Chamberlain	What a loss our ladies	999
	Will have of these trim vanities!	999
	999
LOVELL	Ay, marry,	999
	There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons	999
	Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies;	999
	A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.	999
	999
SANDS	The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going,	999
	For, sure, there's no converting of 'em: now	999
	An honest country lord, as I am, beaten	999
	A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong	999
	And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r lady,	999
	Held current music too.	999
	999
Chamberlain	Well said, Lord Sands;	999
	Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.	999
	999
SANDS	No, my lord;	999
	Nor shall not, while I have a stump.	999
	999
Chamberlain	Sir Thomas,	999
	Whither were you a-going?	999
	999
LOVELL	To the cardinal's:	999
	Your lordship is a guest too.	999
	999
Chamberlain	O, 'tis true:	999
	This night he makes a supper, and a great one,	999
	To many lords and ladies; there will be	999
	The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.	999
	999
LOVELL	That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,	999
	A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;	999
	His dews fall every where.	999
	999
Chamberlain	No doubt he's noble;	999
	He had a black mouth that said other of him.	999
	999
SANDS	He may, my lord; has wherewithal: in him	999
	Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:	999
	Men of his way should be most liberal;	999
	They are set here for examples.	999
	999
Chamberlain	True, they are so:	999
	But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;	999
	Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,	999
	We shall be late else; which I would not be,	999
	For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford	999
	This night to be comptrollers.	999
	999

	GUILDFORD]	999
	999
GUILDFORD	Ladies, a general welcome from his grace	999
	Salutes ye all; this night he dedicates	999
	To fair content and you: none here, he hopes,	999
	In all this noble bevy, has brought with her	999
	One care abroad; he would have all as merry	999
	As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,	999
	Can make good people. O, my lord, you're tardy:	999
	999
	[Enter Chamberlain, SANDS, and LOVELL]	999
	999
	The very thought of this fair company	999
	Clapp'd wings to me.	999
	999
Chamberlain	You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.	999
	999
SANDS	Sir Thomas Lovell, had the cardinal	999
	But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these	999
	Should find a running banquet ere they rested,	999
	I think would better please 'em: by my life,	999
	They are a sweet society of fair ones.	999
	999
LOVELL	O, that your lordship were but now confessor	999
	To one or two of these!	999
	999
SANDS	I would I were;	999
	They should find easy penance.	999
	999
LOVELL	Faith, how easy?	999
	999
SANDS	As easy as a down-bed would afford it.	999
	999
Chamberlain	Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,	999
	Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this:	999
	His grace is entering. Nay, you must not freeze;	999
	Two women placed together makes cold weather:	999
	My Lord Sands, you are one will keep 'em waking;	999
	Pray, sit between these ladies.	999
	999
SANDS	By my faith,	999
	And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies:	999
	If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;	999
	I had it from my father.	999
	999
ANNE	Was he mad, sir?	999
	999
SANDS	O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too:	999
	But he would bite none; just as I do now,	999
	He would kiss you twenty with a breath.	999
	999
	[Kisses her]	999
	999
Chamberlain	Well said, my lord.	999
	So, now you're fairly seated. Gentlemen,	999
	The penance lies on you, if these fair ladies	999
	Pass away frowning.	999
	999
SANDS	For my little cure,	999
	Let me alone.	999
	999
	[Hautboys. Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, and takes his state]	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	You're welcome, my fair guests: that noble lady,	999
	Or gentleman, that is not freely merry,	999
	Is not my friend: this, to confirm my welcome;	999
	And to you all, good health.	999
	999
	[Drinks]	999
	999
SANDS	Your grace is noble:	999
	Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,	999
	And save me so much talking.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	My Lord Sands,	999
	I am beholding to you: cheer your neighbours.	999
	Ladies, you are not merry: gentlemen,	999
	Whose fault is this?	999
	999
SANDS	The red wine first must rise	999
	In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em	999
	Talk us to silence.	999
	999
ANNE	You are a merry gamester,	999
	My Lord Sands.	999
	999
SANDS	                  Yes, if I make my play.	999
	Here's to your ladyship: and pledge it, madam,	999
	For 'tis to such a thing,--	999
	999
ANNE	You cannot show me.	999
	999
SANDS	I told your grace they would talk anon.	999

	[Drum and trumpet, chambers discharged]	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	What's that?	999
	999
Chamberlain	Look out there, some of ye.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant]	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	What warlike voice,	999
	And to what end is this? Nay, ladies, fear not;	999
	By all the laws of war you're privileged.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Servant]	999
	999
Chamberlain	How now! what is't?	999
	999
Servant	A noble troop of strangers;	999
	For so they seem: they've left their barge and landed;	999
	And hither make, as great ambassadors	999
	From foreign princes.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Good lord chamberlain,	999
	Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue;	999
	And, pray, receive 'em nobly, and conduct 'em	999
	Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty	999
	Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.	999
	999
	[Exit Chamberlain, attended. All rise, and tables removed]	999
	999
	You have now a broken banquet; but we'll mend it.	999
	A good digestion to you all: and once more	999
	I shower a welcome on ye; welcome all.	999
	999
	[Hautboys. Enter KING HENRY VIII and others, as	999
	masquers, habited like shepherds, ushered by the	999
	Chamberlain. They pass directly before CARDINAL	999
	WOLSEY, and gracefully salute him]	999
	999
	A noble company! what are their pleasures?	999
	999
Chamberlain	Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd	999
	To tell your grace, that, having heard by fame	999
	Of this so noble and so fair assembly	999
	This night to meet here, they could do no less	999
	Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,	999
	But leave their flocks; and, under your fair conduct,	999
	Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat	999
	An hour of revels with 'em.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Say, lord chamberlain,	999
	They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em	999
	A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.	999
	999
	[They choose Ladies for the dance. KING HENRY VIII	999
	chooses ANNE]	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty,	999
	Till now I never knew thee!	999
	999
	[Music. Dance]	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	My lord!	999
	999
Chamberlain	Your grace?	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Pray, tell 'em thus much from me:	999
	There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,	999
	More worthy this place than myself; to whom,	999
	If I but knew him, with my love and duty	999
	I would surrender it.	999
	999
Chamberlain	I will, my lord.	999
	999
	[Whispers the Masquers]	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	What say they?	999
	999
Chamberlain	                  Such a one, they all confess,	999
	There is indeed; which they would have your grace	999
	Find out, and he will take it.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Let me see, then.	999
	By all your good leaves, gentlemen; here I'll make	999
	My royal choice.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	                  Ye have found him, cardinal:	999
	999
	[Unmasking]	999
	999
	You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord:	999
	You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, cardinal,	999
	I should judge now unhappily.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	I am glad	999
	Your grace is grown so pleasant.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	My lord chamberlain,	999
	Prithee, come hither: what fair lady's that?	999
	999
Chamberlain	An't please your grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter--	999
	The Viscount Rochford,--one of her highness' women.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweetheart,	999
	I were unmannerly, to take you out,	999
	And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!	999
	Let it go round.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready	999
	I' the privy chamber?	999
	999
LOVELL	Yes, my lord.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Your grace,	999
	I fear, with dancing is a little heated.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	I fear, too much.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	                  There's fresher air, my lord,	999
	In the next chamber.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Lead in your ladies, every one: sweet partner,	999
	I must not yet forsake you: let's be merry:	999
	Good my lord cardinal, I have half a dozen healths	999
	To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure	999
	To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream	999
	Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	Westminster. A street.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter two Gentlemen, meeting]	999
	999
First Gentleman	Whither away so fast?	999
	999
Second Gentleman	O, God save ye!	999
	Even to the hall, to hear what shall become	999
	Of the great Duke of Buckingham.	999
	999
First Gentleman	I'll save you	999
	That labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremony	999
	Of bringing back the prisoner.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Were you there?	999
	999
First Gentleman	Yes, indeed, was I.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Pray, speak what has happen'd.	999
	999
First Gentleman	You may guess quickly what.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Is he found guilty?	999
	999
First Gentleman	Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	I am sorry for't.	999
	999
First Gentleman	                  So are a number more.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	But, pray, how pass'd it?	999
	999
First Gentleman	I'll tell you in a little. The great duke	999
	Came to the bar; where to his accusations	999
	He pleaded still not guilty and alleged	999
	Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.	999
	The king's attorney on the contrary	999
	Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions	999
	Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired	999
	To have brought viva voce to his face:	999
	At which appear'd against him his surveyor;	999
	Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,	999
	Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,	999
	Hopkins, that made this mischief.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	That was he	999
	That fed him with his prophecies?	999
	999
First Gentleman	The same.	999
	All these accused him strongly; which he fain	999
	Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:	999
	And so his peers, upon this evidence,	999
	Have found him guilty of high treason. Much	999
	He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all	999
	Was either pitied in him or forgotten.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	After all this, how did he bear himself?	999
	999
First Gentleman	When he was brought again to the bar, to hear	999
	His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd	999
	With such an agony, he sweat extremely,	999
	And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:	999
	But he fell to himself again, and sweetly	999
	In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	I do not think he fears death.	999
	999
First Gentleman	Sure, he does not:	999
	He never was so womanish; the cause	999
	He may a little grieve at.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Certainly	999
	The cardinal is the end of this.	999
	999
First Gentleman	'Tis likely,	999
	By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,	999
	Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,	999
	Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,	999
	Lest he should help his father.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	That trick of state	999
	Was a deep envious one.	999
	999
First Gentleman	At his return	999
	No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,	999
	And generally, whoever the king favours,	999
	The cardinal instantly will find employment,	999
	And far enough from court too.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	All the commons	999
	Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,	999
	Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much	999
	They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,	999
	The mirror of all courtesy;--	999
	999
First Gentleman	Stay there, sir,	999
	And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.	999
	999
	[Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment; tip-staves	999
	before him; the axe with the edge towards him;	999
	halberds on each side: accompanied with LOVELL,	999
	VAUX, SANDS, and common people]	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Let's stand close, and behold him.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	All good people,	999
	You that thus far have come to pity me,	999
	Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.	999
	I have this day received a traitor's judgment,	999
	And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,	999
	And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,	999
	Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!	999
	The law I bear no malice for my death;	999
	'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:	999
	But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:	999
	Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:	999
	Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,	999
	Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;	999
	For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.	999
	For further life in this world I ne'er hope,	999
	Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies	999
	More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,	999
	And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,	999
	His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave	999
	Is only bitter to him, only dying,	999
	Go with me, like good angels, to my end;	999
	And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,	999
	Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,	999
	And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.	999
	999
LOVELL	I do beseech your grace, for charity,	999
	If ever any malice in your heart	999
	Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you	999
	As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;	999
	There cannot be those numberless offences	999
	'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:	999
	no black envy	999
	Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;	999
	And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him	999
	You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers	999
	Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,	999
	Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live	999
	Longer than I have time to tell his years!	999
	Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!	999
	And when old time shall lead him to his end,	999
	Goodness and he fill up one monument!	999
	999
LOVELL	To the water side I must conduct your grace;	999
	Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,	999
	Who undertakes you to your end.	999
	999
VAUX	Prepare there,	999
	The duke is coming: see the barge be ready;	999
	And fit it with such furniture as suits	999
	The greatness of his person.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Nay, Sir Nicholas,	999
	Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.	999
	When I came hither, I was lord high constable	999
	And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:	999
	Yet I am richer than my base accusers,	999
	That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;	999
	And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.	999
	My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,	999
	Who first raised head against usurping Richard,	999
	Flying for succor to his servant Banister,	999
	Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,	999
	And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!	999
	Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying	999
	My father's loss, like a most royal prince,	999
	Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,	999
	Made my name once more noble. Now his son,	999
	Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all	999
	That made me happy at one stroke has taken	999
	For ever from the world. I had my trial,	999
	And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,	999
	A little happier than my wretched father:	999
	Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both	999
	Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;	999
	A most unnatural and faithless service!	999
	Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,	999
	This from a dying man receive as certain:	999
	Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels	999
	Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends	999
	And give your hearts to, when they once perceive	999
	The least rub in your fortunes, fall away	999
	Like water from ye, never found again	999
	But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,	999
	Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour	999
	Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:	999
	And when you would say something that is sad,	999
	Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!	999
	999
	[Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and Train]	999
	999
First Gentleman	O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,	999
	I fear, too many curses on their beads	999
	That were the authors.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	If the duke be guiltless,	999
	'Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inkling	999
	Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,	999
	Greater than this.	999
	999
First Gentleman	                  Good angels keep it from us!	999
	What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?	999
	999
Second Gentleman	This secret is so weighty, 'twill require	999
	A strong faith to conceal it.	999
	999
First Gentleman	Let me have it;	999
	I do not talk much.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	I am confident,	999
	You shall, sir: did you not of late days hear	999
	A buzzing of a separation	999
	Between the king and Katharine?	999
	999
First Gentleman	Yes, but it held not:	999
	For when the king once heard it, out of anger	999
	He sent command to the lord mayor straight	999
	To stop the rumor, and allay those tongues	999
	That durst disperse it.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	But that slander, sir,	999
	Is found a truth now: for it grows again	999
	Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain	999
	The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,	999
	Or some about him near, have, out of malice	999
	To the good queen, possess'd him with a scruple	999
	That will undo her: to confirm this too,	999
	Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;	999
	As all think, for this business.	999
	999
First Gentleman	'Tis the cardinal;	999
	And merely to revenge him on the emperor	999
	For not bestowing on him, at his asking,	999
	The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	I think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruel	999
	That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal	999
	Will have his will, and she must fall.	999
	999
First Gentleman	'Tis woful.	999
	We are too open here to argue this;	999
	Let's think in private more.	999

	999
	[Enter Chamberlain, reading a letter]	999
	999
Chamberlain	'My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, with	999
	all the care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and	999
	furnished. They were young and handsome, and of the	999
	best breed in the north. When they were ready to	999
	set out for London, a man of my lord cardinal's, by	999
	commission and main power, took 'em from me; with	999
	this reason: His master would be served before a	999
	subject, if not before the king; which stopped our	999
	mouths, sir.'	999
	I fear he will indeed: well, let him have them:	999
	He will have all, I think.	999
	999
	[Enter, to Chamberlain, NORFOLK and SUFFOLK]	999
	999
NORFOLK	Well met, my lord chamberlain.	999
	999
Chamberlain	Good day to both your graces.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	How is the king employ'd?	999
	999
Chamberlain	I left him private,	999
	Full of sad thoughts and troubles.	999
	999
NORFOLK	What's the cause?	999
	999
Chamberlain	It seems the marriage with his brother's wife	999
	Has crept too near his conscience.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	No, his conscience	999
	Has crept too near another lady.	999
	999
NORFOLK	'Tis so:	999
	This is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:	999
	That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,	999
	Turns what he list. The king will know him one day.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.	999
	999
NORFOLK	How holily he works in all his business!	999
	And with what zeal! for, now he has crack'd the league	999
	Between us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew,	999
	He dives into the king's soul, and there scatters	999
	Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,	999
	Fears, and despairs; and all these for his marriage:	999
	And out of all these to restore the king,	999
	He counsels a divorce; a loss of her	999
	That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years	999
	About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;	999
	Of her that loves him with that excellence	999
	That angels love good men with; even of her	999
	That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,	999
	Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?	999
	999
Chamberlain	Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true	999
	These news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em,	999
	And every true heart weeps for't: all that dare	999
	Look into these affairs see this main end,	999
	The French king's sister. Heaven will one day open	999
	The king's eyes, that so long have slept upon	999
	This bold bad man.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	                  And free us from his slavery.	999
	999
NORFOLK	We had need pray,	999
	And heartily, for our deliverance;	999
	Or this imperious man will work us all	999
	From princes into pages: all men's honours	999
	Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd	999
	Into what pitch he please.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	For me, my lords,	999
	I love him not, nor fear him; there's my creed:	999
	As I am made without him, so I'll stand,	999
	If the king please; his curses and his blessings	999
	Touch me alike, they're breath I not believe in.	999
	I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him	999
	To him that made him proud, the pope.	999
	999
NORFOLK	Let's in;	999
	And with some other business put the king	999
	From these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him:	999
	My lord, you'll bear us company?	999
	999
Chamberlain	Excuse me;	999
	The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,	999
	You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:	999
	Health to your lordships.	999
	999
NORFOLK	Thanks, my good lord chamberlain.	999
	999
	[Exit Chamberlain; and KING HENRY VIII draws the	999
	curtain, and sits reading pensively]	999

SUFFOLK	How sad he looks! sure, he is much afflicted.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Who's there, ha?	999
	999
NORFOLK	                  Pray God he be not angry.	999

KING HENRY VIII	Who's there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves	999
	Into my private meditations?	999
	Who am I? ha?	999
	999
NORFOLK	A gracious king that pardons all offences	999
	Malice ne'er meant: our breach of duty this way	999
	Is business of estate; in which we come	999
	To know your royal pleasure.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Ye are too bold:	999
	Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business:	999
	Is this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?	999
	999
	[Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS, with	999
	a commission]	999

	I would your grace would give us but an hour	999
	Of private conference.	999

	999
SUFFOLK	[Aside to NORFOLK]             Not to speak of:	999
	I would not be so sick though for his place:	999
	But this cannot continue.	999
	999
NORFOLK	[Aside to SUFFOLK]      If it do,	999
	I'll venture one have-at-him.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	[Aside to NORFOLK]          I another.	999
	999
	[Exeunt NORFOLK and SUFFOLK]	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom	999
	Above all princes, in committing freely	999
	Your scruple to the voice of Christendom:	999
	Who can be angry now? what envy reach you?	999
	The Spaniard, tied blood and favour to her,	999
	Must now confess, if they have any goodness,	999
	The trial just and noble. All the clerks,	999
	I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms	999
	Have their free voices: Rome, the nurse of judgment,	999
	Invited by your noble self, hath sent	999
	One general tongue unto us, this good man,	999
	This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius;	999
	Whom once more I present unto your highness.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,	999
	And thank the holy conclave for their loves:	999
	They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,	999
	You are so noble. To your highness' hand	999
	I tender my commission; by whose virtue,	999
	The court of Rome commanding, you, my lord	999
	Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant	999
	In the unpartial judging of this business.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Two equal men. The queen shall be acquainted	999
	Forthwith for what you come. Where's Gardiner?	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	I know your majesty has always loved her	999
	So dear in heart, not to deny her that	999
	A woman of less place might ask by law:	999
	Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favour	999
	To him that does best: God forbid else. Cardinal,	999
	Prithee, call Gardiner to me, my new secretary:	999
	I find him a fit fellow.	999
	999
	[Exit CARDINAL WOLSEY]	999
	999
	[Re-enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, with GARDINER]	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	[Aside to GARDINER]  Give me your hand much joy and	999
	favour to you;	999
	You are the king's now.	999
	999
GARDINER	[Aside to CARDINAL WOLSEY]	999
		  But to be commanded	999
	For ever by your grace, whose hand has raised me.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Come hither, Gardiner.	999
	999
	[Walks and whispers]	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace	999
	In this man's place before him?	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Yes, he was.	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Was he not held a learned man?	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Yes, surely.	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then	999
	Even of yourself, lord cardinal.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	How! of me?	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	They will not stick to say you envied him,	999
	And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,	999
	Kept him a foreign man still; which so grieved him,	999
	That he ran mad and died.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Heaven's peace be with him!	999
	That's Christian care enough: for living murmurers	999
	There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;	999
	For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,	999
	If I command him, follows my appointment:	999
	I will have none so near else. Learn this, brother,	999
	We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Deliver this with modesty to the queen.	999
	999
	[Exit GARDINER]	999
	999
	The most convenient place that I can think of	999
	For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;	999
	There ye shall meet about this weighty business.	999
	My Wolsey, see it furnish'd. O, my lord,	999
	Would it not grieve an able man to leave	999
	So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!	999
	O, 'tis a tender place; and I must leave her.	999

SCENE III	An ante-chamber of the QUEEN'S apartments.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ANNE and an Old Lady]	999
	999
ANNE	Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:	999
	His highness having lived so long with her, and she	999
	So good a lady that no tongue could ever	999
	Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life,	999
	She never knew harm-doing: O, now, after	999
	So many courses of the sun enthroned,	999
	Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which	999
	To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than	999
	'Tis sweet at first to acquire,--after this process,	999
	To give her the avaunt! it is a pity	999
	Would move a monster.	999
	999
Old Lady	Hearts of most hard temper	999
	Melt and lament for her.	999
	999
ANNE	O, God's will! much better	999
	She ne'er had known pomp: though't be temporal,	999
	Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce	999
	It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging	999
	As soul and body's severing.	999
	999
Old Lady	Alas, poor lady!	999
	She's a stranger now again.	999
	999
ANNE	So much the more	999
	Must pity drop upon her. Verily,	999
	I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,	999
	And range with humble livers in content,	999
	Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief,	999
	And wear a golden sorrow.	999
	999
Old Lady	Our content	999
	Is our best having.	999
	999
ANNE	By my troth and maidenhead,	999
	I would not be a queen.	999
	999
Old Lady	Beshrew me, I would,	999
	And venture maidenhead for't; and so would you,	999
	For all this spice of your hypocrisy:	999
	You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,	999
	Have too a woman's heart; which ever yet	999
	Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;	999
	Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,	999
	Saving your mincing, the capacity	999
	Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,	999
	If you might please to stretch it.	999
	999
ANNE	Nay, good troth.	999
	999
Old Lady	Yes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?	999
	999
ANNE	No, not for all the riches under heaven.	999
	999
Old Lady:	'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me,	999
	Old as I am, to queen it: but, I pray you,	999
	What think you of a duchess? have you limbs	999
	To bear that load of title?	999
	999
ANNE	No, in truth.	999
	999
Old Lady	Then you are weakly made: pluck off a little;	999
	I would not be a young count in your way,	999
	For more than blushing comes to: if your back	999
	Cannot vouchsafe this burthen,'tis too weak	999
	Ever to get a boy.	999
	999
ANNE	                  How you do talk!	999
	I swear again, I would not be a queen	999
	For all the world.	999
	999
Old Lady	                  In faith, for little England	999
	You'ld venture an emballing: I myself	999
	Would for Carnarvonshire, although there long'd	999
	No more to the crown but that. Lo, who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter Chamberlain]	999
	999
Chamberlain	Good morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know	999
	The secret of your conference?	999
	999
ANNE	My good lord,	999
	Not your demand; it values not your asking:	999
	Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.	999
	999
Chamberlain	It was a gentle business, and becoming	999
	The action of good women: there is hope	999
	All will be well.	999
	999
ANNE	                  Now, I pray God, amen!	999
	999
Chamberlain	You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings	999
	Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,	999
	Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's	999
	Ta'en of your many virtues, the king's majesty	999
	Commends his good opinion of you, and	999
	Does purpose honour to you no less flowing	999
	Than Marchioness of Pembroke: to which title	999
	A thousand pound a year, annual support,	999
	Out of his grace he adds.	999
	999
ANNE	I do not know	999
	What kind of my obedience I should tender;	999
	More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers	999
	Are not words duly hallow'd, nor my wishes	999
	More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes	999
	Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,	999
	Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,	999
	As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness;	999
	Whose health and royalty I pray for.	999
	999
Chamberlain	Lady,	999
	I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit	999
	The king hath of you.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
		I have perused her well;	999
	Beauty and honour in her are so mingled	999
	That they have caught the king: and who knows yet	999
	But from this lady may proceed a gem	999
	To lighten all this isle? I'll to the king,	999
	And say I spoke with you.	999
	999
	[Exit Chamberlain]	999
	999
ANNE	My honour'd lord.	999
	999
Old Lady	Why, this it is; see, see!	999
	I have been begging sixteen years in court,	999
	Am yet a courtier beggarly, nor could	999
	Come pat betwixt too early and too late	999
	For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!	999
	A very fresh-fish here--fie, fie, fie upon	999
	This compell'd fortune!--have your mouth fill'd up	999
	Before you open it.	999
	999
ANNE	This is strange to me.	999
	999
Old Lady	How tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence, no.	999
	There was a lady once, 'tis an old story,	999
	That would not be a queen, that would she not,	999
	For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?	999
	999
ANNE	Come, you are pleasant.	999
	999
Old Lady	With your theme, I could	999
	O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!	999
	A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!	999
	No other obligation! By my life,	999
	That promises moe thousands: honour's train	999
	Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time	999
	I know your back will bear a duchess: say,	999
	Are you not stronger than you were?	999
	999
ANNE	Good lady,	999
	Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,	999
	And leave me out on't. Would I had no being,	999
	If this salute my blood a jot: it faints me,	999
	To think what follows.	999
	The queen is comfortless, and we forgetful	999
	In our long absence: pray, do not deliver	999
	What here you've heard to her.	999
	999
Old Lady	What do you think me?	999

SCENE IV	A hall in Black-Friars.	999
	999
	999
	[Trumpets, sennet, and cornets. Enter two Vergers,	999
	with short silver wands; next them, two Scribes, in	999
	the habit of doctors; after them, CANTERBURY alone;	999
	after him, LINCOLN, Ely, Rochester, and Saint	999
	Asaph; next them, with some small distance, follows	999
	a Gentleman bearing the purse, with the great seal,	999
	and a cardinal's hat; then two Priests, bearing	999
	each a silver cross; then a Gentleman-usher	999
	bare-headed, accompanied with a Sergeant-at-arms	999
	bearing a silver mace; then two Gentlemen bearing	999
	two great silver pillars; after them, side by side,	999
	CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS; two Noblemen	999
	with the sword and mace. KING HENRY VIII takes	999
	place under the cloth of state; CARDINAL WOLSEY and	999
	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS sit under him as judges. QUEEN	999
	KATHARINE takes place some distance from KING	999
	HENRY VIII. The Bishops place themselves on each	999
	side the court, in manner of a consistory; below	999
	them, the Scribes. The Lords sit next the Bishops.	999
	The rest of the Attendants stand in convenient	999
	order about the stage]	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Whilst our commission from Rome is read,	999
	Let silence be commanded.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	What's the need?	999
	It hath already publicly been read,	999
	And on all sides the authority allow'd;	999
	You may, then, spare that time.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Be't so. Proceed.	999
	999
Scribe	Say, Henry King of England, come into the court.	999
	999
Crier	Henry King of England, &c.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Here.	999
	999
Scribe	Say, Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.	999
	999
Crier	Katharine Queen of England, &c.	999
	999
	[QUEEN KATHARINE makes no answer, rises out of her	999
	chair, goes about the court, comes to KING HENRY	999
	VIII, and kneels at his feet; then speaks]	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;	999
	And to bestow your pity on me: for	999
	I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,	999
	Born out of your dominions; having here	999
	No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance	999
	Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,	999
	In what have I offended you? what cause	999
	Hath my behavior given to your displeasure,	999
	That thus you should proceed to put me off,	999
	And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,	999
	I have been to you a true and humble wife,	999
	At all times to your will conformable;	999
	Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,	999
	Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry	999
	As I saw it inclined: when was the hour	999
	I ever contradicted your desire,	999
	Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends	999
	Have I not strove to love, although I knew	999
	He were mine enemy? what friend of mine	999
	That had to him derived your anger, did I	999
	Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice	999
	He was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mind	999
	That I have been your wife, in this obedience,	999
	Upward of twenty years, and have been blest	999
	With many children by you: if, in the course	999
	And process of this time, you can report,	999
	And prove it too, against mine honour aught,	999
	My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,	999
	Against your sacred person, in God's name,	999
	Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt	999
	Shut door upon me, and so give me up	999
	To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir,	999
	The king, your father, was reputed for	999
	A prince most prudent, of an excellent	999
	And unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,	999
	My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one	999
	The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many	999
	A year before: it is not to be question'd	999
	That they had gather'd a wise council to them	999
	Of every realm, that did debate this business,	999
	Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly	999
	Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may	999
	Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel	999
	I will implore: if not, i' the name of God,	999
	Your pleasure be fulfill'd!	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	You have here, lady,	999
	And of your choice, these reverend fathers; men	999
	Of singular integrity and learning,	999
	Yea, the elect o' the land, who are assembled	999
	To plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootless	999
	That longer you desire the court; as well	999
	For your own quiet, as to rectify	999
	What is unsettled in the king.	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	His grace	999
	Hath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,	999
	It's fit this royal session do proceed;	999
	And that, without delay, their arguments	999
	Be now produced and heard.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Lord cardinal,	999
	To you I speak.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	                  Your pleasure, madam?	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Sir,	999
	I am about to weep; but, thinking that	999
	We are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certain	999
	The daughter of a king, my drops of tears	999
	I'll turn to sparks of fire.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Be patient yet.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	I will, when you are humble; nay, before,	999
	Or God will punish me. I do believe,	999
	Induced by potent circumstances, that	999
	You are mine enemy, and make my challenge	999
	You shall not be my judge: for it is you	999
	Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;	999
	Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,	999
	I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul	999
	Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,	999
	I hold my most malicious foe, and think not	999
	At all a friend to truth.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	I do profess	999
	You speak not like yourself; who ever yet	999
	Have stood to charity, and display'd the effects	999
	Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom	999
	O'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong:	999
	I have no spleen against you; nor injustice	999
	For you or any: how far I have proceeded,	999
	Or how far further shall, is warranted	999
	By a commission from the consistory,	999
	Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me	999
	That I have blown this coal: I do deny it:	999
	The king is present: if it be known to him	999
	That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,	999
	And worthily, my falsehood! yea, as much	999
	As you have done my truth. If he know	999
	That I am free of your report, he knows	999
	I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him	999
	It lies to cure me: and the cure is, to	999
	Remove these thoughts from you: the which before	999
	His highness shall speak in, I do beseech	999
	You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking	999
	And to say so no more.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	My lord, my lord,	999
	I am a simple woman, much too weak	999
	To oppose your cunning. You're meek and	999
	humble-mouth'd;	999
	You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,	999
	With meekness and humility; but your heart	999
	Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.	999
	You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,	999
	Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted	999
	Where powers are your retainers, and your words,	999
	Domestics to you, serve your will as't please	999
	Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,	999
	You tender more your person's honour than	999
	Your high profession spiritual: that again	999
	I do refuse you for my judge; and here,	999
	Before you all, appeal unto the pope,	999
	To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,	999
	And to be judged by him.	999
	999
	[She curtsies to KING HENRY VIII, and offers to depart]	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	The queen is obstinate,	999
	Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and	999
	Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.	999
	She's going away.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Call her again.	999
	999
Crier	Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.	999
	999
GRIFFITH	Madam, you are call'd back.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	What need you note it? pray you, keep your way:	999
	When you are call'd, return. Now, the Lord help,	999
	They vex me past my patience! Pray you, pass on:	999
	I will not tarry; no, nor ever more	999
	Upon this business my appearance make	999
	In any of their courts.	999
	999
	[Exeunt QUEEN KATHARINE and her Attendants]	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Go thy ways, Kate:	999
	That man i' the world who shall report he has	999
	A better wife, let him in nought be trusted,	999
	For speaking false in that: thou art, alone,	999
	If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,	999
	Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,	999
	Obeying in commanding, and thy parts	999
	Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out,	999
	The queen of earthly queens: she's noble born;	999
	And, like her true nobility, she has	999
	Carried herself towards me.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Most gracious sir,	999
	In humblest manner I require your highness,	999
	That it shall please you to declare, in hearing	999
	Of all these ears,--for where I am robb'd and bound,	999
	There must I be unloosed, although not there	999
	At once and fully satisfied,--whether ever I	999
	Did broach this business to your highness; or	999
	Laid any scruple in your way, which might	999
	Induce you to the question on't? or ever	999
	Have to you, but with thanks to God for such	999
	A royal lady, spake one the least word that might	999
	Be to the prejudice of her present state,	999
	Or touch of her good person?	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	My lord cardinal,	999
	I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,	999
	I free you from't. You are not to be taught	999
	That you have many enemies, that know not	999
	Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,	999
	Bark when their fellows do: by some of these	999
	The queen is put in anger. You're excused:	999
	But will you be more justified? You ever	999
	Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired	999
	It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,	999
	The passages made toward it: on my honour,	999
	I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,	999
	And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,	999
	I will be bold with time and your attention:	999
	Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:	999
	My conscience first received a tenderness,	999
	Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd	999
	By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;	999
	Who had been hither sent on the debating	999
	A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and	999
	Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,	999
	Ere a determinate resolution, he,	999
	I mean the bishop, did require a respite;	999
	Wherein he might the king his lord advertise	999
	Whether our daughter were legitimate,	999
	Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,	999
	Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook	999
	The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,	999
	Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble	999
	The region of my breast; which forced such way,	999
	That many mazed considerings did throng	999
	And press'd in with this caution. First, methought	999
	I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had	999
	Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,	999
	If it conceived a male child by me, should	999
	Do no more offices of life to't than	999
	The grave does to the dead; for her male issue	999
	Or died where they were made, or shortly after	999
	This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,	999
	This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,	999
	Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not	999
	Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that	999
	I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in	999
	By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me	999
	Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in	999
	The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer	999
	Toward this remedy, whereupon we are	999
	Now present here together: that's to say,	999
	I meant to rectify my conscience,--which	999
	I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--	999
	By all the reverend fathers of the land	999
	And doctors learn'd: first I began in private	999
	With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember	999
	How under my oppression I did reek,	999
	When I first moved you.	999
	999
LINCOLN	Very well, my liege.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say	999
	How far you satisfied me.	999
	999
LINCOLN	So please your highness,	999
	The question did at first so stagger me,	999
	Bearing a state of mighty moment in't	999
	And consequence of dread, that I committed	999
	The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;	999
	And did entreat your highness to this course	999
	Which you are running here.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	I then moved you,	999
	My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave	999
	To make this present summons: unsolicited	999
	I left no reverend person in this court;	999
	But by particular consent proceeded	999
	Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:	999
	For no dislike i' the world against the person	999
	Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points	999
	Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward:	999
	Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life	999
	And kingly dignity, we are contented	999
	To wear our mortal state to come with her,	999
	Katharine our queen, before the primest creature	999
	That's paragon'd o' the world.	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	So please your highness,	999
	The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness	999
	That we adjourn this court till further day:	999
	Meanwhile must be an earnest motion	999
	Made to the queen, to call back her appeal	999
	She intends unto his holiness.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	[Aside]	I may perceive	999
	These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor	999
	This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.	999
	My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,	999
	Prithee, return: with thy approach, I know,	999
	My comfort comes along. Break up the court:	999
	I say, set on.	999

SCENE I	London. QUEEN KATHARINE's apartments.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter QUEEN KATHARINE and her Women, as at work]	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with troubles;	999
	Sing, and disperse 'em, if thou canst: leave working.	999
	[SONG]	999
	999
	Orpheus with his lute made trees,	999
	And the mountain tops that freeze,	999
	Bow themselves when he did sing:	999
	To his music plants and flowers	999
	Ever sprung; as sun and showers	999
	There had made a lasting spring.	999
	999
	Every thing that heard him play,	999
	Even the billows of the sea,	999
	Hung their heads, and then lay by.	999
	In sweet music is such art,	999
	Killing care and grief of heart	999
	Fall asleep, or hearing, die.	999
	999
	[Enter a Gentleman]	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	How now!	999
	999
Gentleman	An't please your grace, the two great cardinals	999
	Wait in the presence.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Would they speak with me?	999
	999
Gentleman	They will'd me say so, madam.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Pray their graces	999
	To come near.	999
	999
	[Exit Gentleman]	999
	999
	What can be their business	999
	With me, a poor weak woman, fall'n from favour?	999
	I do not like their coming. Now I think on't,	999
	They should be good men; their affairs as righteous:	999
	But all hoods make not monks.	999
	999
	[Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS]	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Peace to your highness!	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Your graces find me here part of a housewife,	999
	I would be all, against the worst may happen.	999
	What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	May it please you noble madam, to withdraw	999
	Into your private chamber, we shall give you	999
	The full cause of our coming.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Speak it here:	999
	There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,	999
	Deserves a corner: would all other women	999
	Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!	999
	My lords, I care not, so much I am happy	999
	Above a number, if my actions	999
	Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em,	999
	Envy and base opinion set against 'em,	999
	I know my life so even. If your business	999
	Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,	999
	Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina	999
	serenissima,--	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	O, good my lord, no Latin;	999
	I am not such a truant since my coming,	999
	As not to know the language I have lived in:	999
	A strange tongue makes my cause more strange,	999
	suspicious;	999
	Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you,	999
	If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;	999
	Believe me, she has had much wrong: lord cardinal,	999
	The willing'st sin I ever yet committed	999
	May be absolved in English.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Noble lady,	999
	I am sorry my integrity should breed,	999
	And service to his majesty and you,	999
	So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.	999
	We come not by the way of accusation,	999
	To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,	999
	Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,	999
	You have too much, good lady; but to know	999
	How you stand minded in the weighty difference	999
	Between the king and you; and to deliver,	999
	Like free and honest men, our just opinions	999
	And comforts to your cause.	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Most honour'd madam,	999
	My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,	999
	Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,	999
	Forgetting, like a good man your late censure	999
	Both of his truth and him, which was too far,	999
	Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,	999
	His service and his counsel.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	[Aside]	To betray me.--	999
	My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;	999
	Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!	999
	But how to make ye suddenly an answer,	999
	In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,--	999
	More near my life, I fear,--with my weak wit,	999
	And to such men of gravity and learning,	999
	In truth, I know not. I was set at work	999
	Among my maids: full little, God knows, looking	999
	Either for such men or such business.	999
	For her sake that I have been,--for I feel	999
	The last fit of my greatness,--good your graces,	999
	Let me have time and counsel for my cause:	999
	Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:	999
	Your hopes and friends are infinite.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	In England	999
	But little for my profit: can you think, lords,	999
	That any Englishman dare give me counsel?	999
	Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure,	999
	Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,	999
	And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,	999
	They that must weigh out my afflictions,	999
	They that my trust must grow to, live not here:	999
	They are, as all my other comforts, far hence	999
	In mine own country, lords.	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	I would your grace	999
	Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	How, sir?	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Put your main cause into the king's protection;	999
	He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much	999
	Both for your honour better and your cause;	999
	For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,	999
	You'll part away disgraced.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	He tells you rightly.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin:	999
	Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!	999
	Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge	999
	That no king can corrupt.	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Your rage mistakes us.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,	999
	Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;	999
	But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:	999
	Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?	999
	The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,	999
	A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?	999
	I will not wish ye half my miseries;	999
	I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye;	999
	Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once	999
	The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Madam, this is a mere distraction;	999
	You turn the good we offer into envy.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye	999
	And all such false professors! would you have me--	999
	If you have any justice, any pity;	999
	If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits--	999
	Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?	999
	Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,	999
	His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,	999
	And all the fellowship I hold now with him	999
	Is only my obedience. What can happen	999
	To me above this wretchedness? all your studies	999
	Make me a curse like this.	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Your fears are worse.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,	999
	Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?	999
	A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,	999
	Never yet branded with suspicion?	999
	Have I with all my full affections	999
	Still met the king? loved him next heaven?	999
	obey'd him?	999
	Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?	999
	Almost forgot my prayers to content him?	999
	And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords.	999
	Bring me a constant woman to her husband,	999
	One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;	999
	And to that woman, when she has done most,	999
	Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,	999
	To give up willingly that noble title	999
	Your master wed me to: nothing but death	999
	Shall e'er divorce my dignities.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Pray, hear me.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Would I had never trod this English earth,	999
	Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!	999
	Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.	999
	What will become of me now, wretched lady!	999
	I am the most unhappy woman living.	999
	Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!	999
	Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,	999
	No friend, no hope; no kindred weep for me;	999
	Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily,	999
	That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd,	999
	I'll hang my head and perish.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	If your grace	999
	Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,	999
	You'ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady,	999
	Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,	999
	The way of our profession is against it:	999
	We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.	999
	For goodness' sake, consider what you do;	999
	How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly	999
	Grow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage.	999
	The hearts of princes kiss obedience,	999
	So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits	999
	They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.	999
	I know you have a gentle, noble temper,	999
	A soul as even as a calm: pray, think us	999
	Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.	999
	999
CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues	999
	With these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,	999
	As yours was put into you, ever casts	999
	Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;	999
	Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please	999
	To trust us in your business, we are ready	999
	To use our utmost studies in your service.	999
	999
QUEEN KATHARINE	Do what ye will, my lords: and, pray, forgive me,	999
	If I have used myself unmannerly;	999
	You know I am a woman, lacking wit	999
	To make a seemly answer to such persons.	999
	Pray, do my service to his majesty:	999
	He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers	999
	While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,	999
	Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,	999
	That little thought, when she set footing here,	999
	She should have bought her dignities so dear.	999

	999
NORFOLK	If you will now unite in your complaints,	999
	And force them with a constancy, the cardinal	999
	Cannot stand under them: if you omit	999
	The offer of this time, I cannot promise	999
	But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,	999
	With these you bear already.	999
	999
SURREY	I am joyful	999
	To meet the least occasion that may give me	999
	Remembrance of my father-in-law, the duke,	999
	To be revenged on him.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Which of the peers	999
	Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least	999
	Strangely neglected? when did he regard	999
	The stamp of nobleness in any person	999
	Out of himself?	999
	999
Chamberlain	                  My lords, you speak your pleasures:	999
	What he deserves of you and me I know;	999
	What we can do to him, though now the time	999
	Gives way to us, I much fear. If you cannot	999
	Bar his access to the king, never attempt	999
	Any thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft	999
	Over the king in's tongue.	999
	999
NORFOLK	O, fear him not;	999
	His spell in that is out: the king hath found	999
	Matter against him that for ever mars	999
	The honey of his language. No, he's settled,	999
	Not to come off, in his displeasure.	999
	999
SURREY	Sir,	999
	I should be glad to hear such news as this	999
	Once every hour.	999
	999
NORFOLK	                  Believe it, this is true:	999
	In the divorce his contrary proceedings	999
	Are all unfolded wherein he appears	999
	As I would wish mine enemy.	999
	999
SURREY	How came	999
	His practises to light?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Most strangely.	999
	999
SURREY	O, how, how?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	The cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried,	999
	And came to the eye o' the king: wherein was read,	999
	How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness	999
	To stay the judgment o' the divorce; for if	999
	It did take place, 'I do,' quoth he, 'perceive	999
	My king is tangled in affection to	999
	A creature of the queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'	999
	999
SURREY	Has the king this?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	                  Believe it.	999
	999
SURREY	Will this work?	999
	999
Chamberlain	The king in this perceives him, how he coasts	999
	And hedges his own way. But in this point	999
	All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic	999
	After his patient's death: the king already	999
	Hath married the fair lady.	999
	999
SURREY	Would he had!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	May you be happy in your wish, my lord	999
	For, I profess, you have it.	999
	999
SURREY	Now, all my joy	999
	Trace the conjunction!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	My amen to't!	999
	999
NORFOLK	All men's!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	There's order given for her coronation:	999
	Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left	999
	To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,	999
	She is a gallant creature, and complete	999
	In mind and feature: I persuade me, from her	999
	Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall	999
	In it be memorised.	999
	999
SURREY	But, will the king	999
	Digest this letter of the cardinal's?	999
	The Lord forbid!	999
	999
NORFOLK	                  Marry, amen!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	No, no;	999
	There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose	999
	Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius	999
	Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;	999
	Has left the cause o' the king unhandled; and	999
	Is posted, as the agent of our cardinal,	999
	To second all his plot. I do assure you	999
	The king cried Ha! at this.	999
	999
Chamberlain	Now, God incense him,	999
	And let him cry Ha! louder!	999
	999
NORFOLK	But, my lord,	999
	When returns Cranmer?	999
	999
SUFFOLK	He is return'd in his opinions; which	999
	Have satisfied the king for his divorce,	999
	Together with all famous colleges	999
	Almost in Christendom: shortly, I believe,	999
	His second marriage shall be publish'd, and	999
	Her coronation. Katharine no more	999
	Shall be call'd queen, but princess dowager	999
	And widow to Prince Arthur.	999
	999
NORFOLK	This same Cranmer's	999
	A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain	999
	In the king's business.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	He has; and we shall see him	999
	For it an archbishop.	999
	999
NORFOLK	So I hear.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	'Tis so.	999

	He did unseal them: and the first he view'd,	999
	He did it with a serious mind; a heed	999
	Was in his countenance. You he bade	999
	Attend him here this morning.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Is he ready	999
	To come abroad?	999
	999
CROMWELL	                  I think, by this he is.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Leave me awhile.	999
	999
	[Exit CROMWELL]	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,	999
	The French king's sister: he shall marry her.	999
	Anne Bullen! No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:	999
	There's more in't than fair visage. Bullen!	999
	No, we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish	999
	To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!	999
	999
NORFOLK	He's discontented.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	                  May be, he hears the king	999
	Does whet his anger to him.	999
	999
SURREY	Sharp enough,	999
	Lord, for thy justice!	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	[Aside]  The late queen's gentlewoman,	999
	a knight's daughter,	999
	To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!	999
	This candle burns not clear: 'tis I must snuff it;	999
	Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous	999
	And well deserving? yet I know her for	999
	A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to	999
	Our cause, that she should lie i' the bosom of	999
	Our hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung up	999
	An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one	999
	Hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,	999
	And is his oracle.	999
	999
NORFOLK	                  He is vex'd at something.	999
	999
SURREY	I would 'twere something that would fret the string,	999
	The master-cord on's heart!	999
	999
	[Enter KING HENRY VIII, reading of a schedule, and LOVELL]	999
	999
SUFFOLK	The king, the king!	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	What piles of wealth hath he accumulated	999
	To his own portion! and what expense by the hour	999
	Seems to flow from him! How, i' the name of thrift,	999
	Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,	999
	Saw you the cardinal?	999
	999
NORFOLK	My lord, we have	999
	Stood here observing him: some strange commotion	999
	Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;	999
	Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,	999
	Then lays his finger on his temple, straight	999
	Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,	999
	Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts	999
	His eye against the moon: in most strange postures	999
	We have seen him set himself.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	It may well be;	999
	There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning	999
	Papers of state he sent me to peruse,	999
	As I required: and wot you what I found	999
	There,--on my conscience, put unwittingly?	999
	Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;	999
	The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,	999
	Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which	999
	I find at such proud rate, that it out-speaks	999
	Possession of a subject.	999
	999
NORFOLK	It's heaven's will:	999
	Some spirit put this paper in the packet,	999
	To bless your eye withal.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	If we did think	999
	His contemplation were above the earth,	999
	And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still	999
	Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid	999
	His thinkings are below the moon, not worth	999
	His serious considering.	999
	999
	[King HENRY VIII takes his seat; whispers LOVELL,	999
	who goes to CARDINAL WOLSEY]	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Heaven forgive me!	999
	Ever God bless your highness!	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Good my lord,	999
	You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory	999
	Of your best graces in your mind; the which	999
	You were now running o'er: you have scarce time	999
	To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span	999
	To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that	999
	I deem you an ill husband, and am glad	999
	To have you therein my companion.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Sir,	999
	For holy offices I have a time; a time	999
	To think upon the part of business which	999
	I bear i' the state; and nature does require	999
	Her times of preservation, which perforce	999
	I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,	999
	Must give my tendence to.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	You have said well.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	And ever may your highness yoke together,	999
	As I will lend you cause, my doing well	999
	With my well saying!	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	'Tis well said again;	999
	And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:	999
	And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:	999
	His said he did; and with his deed did crown	999
	His word upon you. Since I had my office,	999
	I have kept you next my heart; have not alone	999
	Employ'd you where high profits might come home,	999
	But pared my present havings, to bestow	999
	My bounties upon you.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	[Aside]             What should this mean?	999
	999
SURREY	[Aside]  The Lord increase this business!	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Have I not made you,	999
	The prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me,	999
	If what I now pronounce you have found true:	999
	And, if you may confess it, say withal,	999
	If you are bound to us or no. What say you?	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,	999
	Shower'd on me daily, have been more than could	999
	My studied purposes requite; which went	999
	Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours	999
	Have ever come too short of my desires,	999
	Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends	999
	Have been mine so that evermore they pointed	999
	To the good of your most sacred person and	999
	The profit of the state. For your great graces	999
	Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I	999
	Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,	999
	My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,	999
	Which ever has and ever shall be growing,	999
	Till death, that winter, kill it.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Fairly answer'd;	999
	A loyal and obedient subject is	999
	Therein illustrated: the honour of it	999
	Does pay the act of it; as, i' the contrary,	999
	The foulness is the punishment. I presume	999
	That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,	999
	My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, more	999
	On you than any; so your hand and heart,	999
	Your brain, and every function of your power,	999
	Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,	999
	As 'twere in love's particular, be more	999
	To me, your friend, than any.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	I do profess	999
	That for your highness' good I ever labour'd	999
	More than mine own; that am, have, and will be--	999
	Though all the world should crack their duty to you,	999
	And throw it from their soul; though perils did	999
	Abound, as thick as thought could make 'em, and	999
	Appear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty,	999
	As doth a rock against the chiding flood,	999
	Should the approach of this wild river break,	999
	And stand unshaken yours.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	'Tis nobly spoken:	999
	Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,	999
	For you have seen him open't. Read o'er this;	999
	999
	[Giving him papers]	999
	999
	And after, this: and then to breakfast with	999
	What appetite you have.	999
	999
	[Exit KING HENRY VIII, frowning upon CARDINAL WOLSEY:	999
	the Nobles throng after him, smiling and whispering]	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	What should this mean?	999
	What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?	999
	He parted frowning from me, as if ruin	999
	Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion	999
	Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;	999
	Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;	999
	I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;	999
	This paper has undone me: 'tis the account	999
	Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together	999
	For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,	999
	And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!	999
	Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil	999
	Made me put this main secret in the packet	999
	I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?	999
	No new device to beat this from his brains?	999
	I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know	999
	A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune	999
	Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!'	999
	The letter, as I live, with all the business	999
	I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!	999
	I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;	999
	And, from that full meridian of my glory,	999
	I haste now to my setting: I shall fall	999
	Like a bright exhalation m the evening,	999
	And no man see me more.	999
	999
	[Re-enter to CARDINAL WOLSEY, NORFOLK and SUFFOLK, SURREY,	999
	and the Chamberlain]	999
	999
NORFOLK	Hear the king's pleasure, cardinal: who commands you	999
	To render up the great seal presently	999
	Into our hands; and to confine yourself	999
	To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's,	999
	Till you hear further from his highness.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Stay:	999
	Where's your commission, lords? words cannot carry	999
	Authority so weighty.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Who dare cross 'em,	999
	Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Till I find more than will or words to do it,	999
	I mean your malice, know, officious lords,	999
	I dare and must deny it. Now I feel	999
	Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy:	999
	How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,	999
	As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton	999
	Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!	999
	Follow your envious courses, men of malice;	999
	You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,	999
	In time will find their fit rewards. That seal,	999
	You ask with such a violence, the king,	999
	Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;	999
	Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,	999
	During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,	999
	Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?	999
	999
SURREY	The king, that gave it.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	It must be himself, then.	999
	999
SURREY	Thou art a proud traitor, priest.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Proud lord, thou liest:	999
	Within these forty hours Surrey durst better	999
	Have burnt that tongue than said so.	999
	999
SURREY	Thy ambition,	999
	Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land	999
	Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:	999
	The heads of all thy brother cardinals,	999
	With thee and all thy best parts bound together,	999
	Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!	999
	You sent me deputy for Ireland;	999
	Far from his succor, from the king, from all	999
	That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him;	999
	Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,	999
	Absolved him with an axe.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	This, and all else	999
	This talking lord can lay upon my credit,	999
	I answer is most false. The duke by law	999
	Found his deserts: how innocent I was	999
	From any private malice in his end,	999
	His noble jury and foul cause can witness.	999
	If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you	999
	You have as little honesty as honour,	999
	That in the way of loyalty and truth	999
	Toward the king, my ever royal master,	999
	Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,	999
	And all that love his follies.	999
	999
SURREY	By my soul,	999
	Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou	999
	shouldst feel	999
	My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords,	999
	Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?	999
	And from this fellow? if we live thus tamely,	999
	To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,	999
	Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,	999
	And dare us with his cap like larks.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	All goodness	999
	Is poison to thy stomach.	999
	999
SURREY	Yes, that goodness	999
	Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one,	999
	Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion;	999
	The goodness of your intercepted packets	999
	You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness,	999
	Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.	999
	My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,	999
	As you respect the common good, the state	999
	Of our despised nobility, our issues,	999
	Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,	999
	Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles	999
	Collected from his life. I'll startle you	999
	Worse than the scaring bell, when the brown wench	999
	Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	How much, methinks, I could despise this man,	999
	But that I am bound in charity against it!	999
	999
NORFOLK	Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hand:	999
	But, thus much, they are foul ones.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	So much fairer	999
	And spotless shall mine innocence arise,	999
	When the king knows my truth.	999
	999
SURREY	This cannot save you:	999
	I thank my memory, I yet remember	999
	Some of these articles; and out they shall.	999
	Now, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal,	999
	You'll show a little honesty.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Speak on, sir;	999
	I dare your worst objections: if I blush,	999
	It is to see a nobleman want manners.	999
	999
SURREY	I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!	999
	First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge,	999
	You wrought to be a legate; by which power	999
	You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.	999
	999
NORFOLK	Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else	999
	To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'	999
	Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king	999
	To be your servant.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Then that, without the knowledge	999
	Either of king or council, when you went	999
	Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold	999
	To carry into Flanders the great seal.	999
	999
SURREY	Item, you sent a large commission	999
	To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,	999
	Without the king's will or the state's allowance,	999
	A league between his highness and Ferrara.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	That, out of mere ambition, you have caused	999
	Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.	999
	999
SURREY	Then that you have sent innumerable substance--	999
	By what means got, I leave to your own conscience--	999
	To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways	999
	You have for dignities; to the mere undoing	999
	Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;	999
	Which, since they are of you, and odious,	999
	I will not taint my mouth with.	999
	999
Chamberlain	O my lord,	999
	Press not a falling man too far! 'tis virtue:	999
	His faults lie open to the laws; let them,	999
	Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him	999
	So little of his great self.	999
	999
SURREY	I forgive him.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,	999
	Because all those things you have done of late,	999
	By your power legatine, within this kingdom,	999
	Fall into the compass of a praemunire,	999
	That therefore such a writ be sued against you;	999
	To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,	999
	Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be	999
	Out of the king's protection. This is my charge.	999
	999
NORFOLK	And so we'll leave you to your meditations	999
	How to live better. For your stubborn answer	999
	About the giving back the great seal to us,	999
	The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.	999
	So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but CARDINAL WOLSEY]	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	So farewell to the little good you bear me.	999
	Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!	999
	This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth	999
	The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,	999
	And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;	999
	The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,	999
	And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely	999
	His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,	999
	And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,	999
	Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,	999
	This many summers in a sea of glory,	999
	But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride	999
	At length broke under me and now has left me,	999
	Weary and old with service, to the mercy	999
	Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.	999
	Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:	999
	I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched	999
	Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!	999
	There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,	999
	That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,	999
	More pangs and fears than wars or women have:	999
	And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,	999
	Never to hope again.	999
	999
	[Enter CROMWELL, and stands amazed]	999
	999
		Why, how now, Cromwell!	999
	999
CROMWELL	I have no power to speak, sir.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	What, amazed	999
	At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder	999
	A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,	999
	I am fall'n indeed.	999
	999
CROMWELL	How does your grace?	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Why, well;	999
	Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.	999
	I know myself now; and I feel within me	999
	A peace above all earthly dignities,	999
	A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,	999
	I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,	999
	These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken	999
	A load would sink a navy, too much honour:	999
	O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen	999
	Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!	999
	999
CROMWELL	I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,	999
	Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,	999
	To endure more miseries and greater far	999
	Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.	999
	What news abroad?	999
	999
CROMWELL	                  The heaviest and the worst	999
	Is your displeasure with the king.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	God bless him!	999
	999
CROMWELL	The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen	999
	Lord chancellor in your place.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	That's somewhat sudden:	999
	But he's a learned man. May he continue	999
	Long in his highness' favour, and do justice	999
	For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,	999
	When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,	999
	May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?	999
	999
CROMWELL	That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,	999
	Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	That's news indeed.	999
	999
CROMWELL	Last, that the Lady Anne,	999
	Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,	999
	This day was view'd in open as his queen,	999
	Going to chapel; and the voice is now	999
	Only about her coronation.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,	999
	The king has gone beyond me: all my glories	999
	In that one woman I have lost for ever:	999
	No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,	999
	Or gild again the noble troops that waited	999
	Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;	999
	I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now	999
	To be thy lord and master: seek the king;	999
	That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him	999
	What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;	999
	Some little memory of me will stir him--	999
	I know his noble nature--not to let	999
	Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,	999
	Neglect him not; make use now, and provide	999
	For thine own future safety.	999
	999
CROMWELL	O my lord,	999
	Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forego	999
	So good, so noble and so true a master?	999
	Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,	999
	With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.	999
	The king shall have my service: but my prayers	999
	For ever and for ever shall be yours.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear	999
	In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,	999
	Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.	999
	Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;	999
	And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,	999
	And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention	999
	Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,	999
	Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,	999
	And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,	999
	Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;	999
	A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.	999
	Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.	999
	Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:	999
	By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,	999
	The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?	999
	Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;	999
	Corruption wins not more than honesty.	999
	Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,	999
	To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:	999
	Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,	999
	Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,	999
	O Cromwell,	999
	Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;	999
	And,--prithee, lead me in:	999
	There take an inventory of all I have,	999
	To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,	999
	And my integrity to heaven, is all	999
	I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!	999
	Had I but served my God with half the zeal	999
	I served my king, he would not in mine age	999
	Have left me naked to mine enemies.	999
	999
CROMWELL	Good sir, have patience.	999
	999
CARDINAL WOLSEY	So I have. Farewell	999
	The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	A street in Westminster.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another]	999
	999
First Gentleman	You're well met once again.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	So are you.	999
	999
First Gentleman	You come to take your stand here, and behold	999
	The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?	999
	999
Second Gentleman	'Tis all my business. At our last encounter,	999
	The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.	999
	999
First Gentleman	'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;	999
	This, general joy.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	'Tis well: the citizens,	999
	I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds--	999
	As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward--	999
	In celebration of this day with shows,	999
	Pageants and sights of honour.	999
	999
First Gentleman	Never greater,	999
	Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	May I be bold to ask at what that contains,	999
	That paper in your hand?	999
	999
First Gentleman	Yes; 'tis the list	999
	Of those that claim their offices this day	999
	By custom of the coronation.	999
	The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims	999
	To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,	999
	He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,	999
	I should have been beholding to your paper.	999
	But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,	999
	The princess dowager? how goes her business?	999
	999
First Gentleman	That I can tell you too. The Archbishop	999
	Of Canterbury, accompanied with other	999
	Learned and reverend fathers of his order,	999
	Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off	999
	From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which	999
	She was often cited by them, but appear'd not:	999
	And, to be short, for not appearance and	999
	The king's late scruple, by the main assent	999
	Of all these learned men she was divorced,	999
	And the late marriage made of none effect	999
	Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,	999
	Where she remains now sick.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Alas, good lady!	999
	999
	[Trumpets]	999
	999
	The trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming.	999
	999
	[Hautboys]	999
	999
	[THE ORDER OF THE CORONATION]	999
	999
	1. A lively flourish of Trumpets.	999
	999
	2. Then, two Judges.	999
	999
	3. Lord Chancellor, with the purse and mace	999
	before him.	999
	999
	4. Choristers, singing.	999
	999
	[Music]	999
	999
	5. Mayor of London, bearing the mace. Then	999
	Garter, in his coat of arms, and on his	999
	head a gilt copper crown.	999
	999
	6. Marquess Dorset, bearing a sceptre of gold,	999
	on his head a demi-coronal of gold. With	999
	him, SURREY, bearing the rod of silver with	999
	the dove, crowned with an earl's coronet.	999
	Collars of SS.	999
	999
	7. SUFFOLK, in his robe of estate, his coronet	999
	on his head, bearing a long white wand, as	999
	high-steward. With him, NORFOLK, with the	999
	rod of marshalship, a coronet on his head.	999
	Collars of SS.	999
	999
	8. A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-ports;	999
	under it, QUEEN ANNE in her robe; in her hair	999
	richly adorned with pearl, crowned. On each	999
	side her, the Bishops of London and	999
	Winchester.	999
	999
	9. The old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal of	999
	gold, wrought with flowers, bearing QUEEN	999
	ANNE's train.	999
	999
	10. Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain	999
	circlets of gold without flowers.	999
	999
	[They pass over the stage in order and state]	999
	999
Second Gentleman	A royal train, believe me. These I know:	999
	Who's that that bears the sceptre?	999
	999
First Gentleman	Marquess Dorset:	999
	And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	A bold brave gentleman. That should be	999
	The Duke of Suffolk?	999
	999
First Gentleman	'Tis the same: high-steward.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	And that my Lord of Norfolk?	999
	999
First Gentleman	Yes;	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Heaven bless thee!	999
	999
	[Looking on QUEEN ANNE]	999
	999
	Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.	999
	Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;	999
	Our king has all the Indies in his arms,	999
	And more and richer, when he strains that lady:	999
	I cannot blame his conscience.	999
	999
First Gentleman	They that bear	999
	The cloth of honour over her, are four barons	999
	Of the Cinque-ports.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.	999
	I take it, she that carries up the train	999
	Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.	999
	999
First Gentleman	It is; and all the rest are countesses.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed;	999
	And sometimes falling ones.	999
	999
First Gentleman	No more of that.	999
	999
	[Exit procession, and then a great flourish of trumpets]	999
	999
	[Enter a third Gentleman]	999
	999
First Gentleman	God save you, sir! where have you been broiling?	999
	999
Third Gentleman	Among the crowd i' the Abbey; where a finger	999
	Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled	999
	With the mere rankness of their joy.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	You saw	999
	The ceremony?	999
	999
Third Gentleman	                  That I did.	999
	999
First Gentleman	How was it?	999
	999
Third Gentleman	Well worth the seeing.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Good sir, speak it to us.	999
	999
Third Gentleman	As well as I am able. The rich stream	999
	Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen	999
	To a prepared place in the choir, fell off	999
	A distance from her; while her grace sat down	999
	To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,	999
	In a rich chair of state, opposing freely	999
	The beauty of her person to the people.	999
	Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman	999
	That ever lay by man: which when the people	999
	Had the full view of, such a noise arose	999
	As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,	999
	As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--	999
	Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their faces	999
	Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy	999
	I never saw before. Great-bellied women,	999
	That had not half a week to go, like rams	999
	In the old time of war, would shake the press,	999
	And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living	999
	Could say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven	999
	So strangely in one piece.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	But, what follow'd?	999
	999
Third Gentleman	At length her grace rose, and with modest paces	999
	Came to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-like	999
	Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.	999
	Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:	999
	When by the Archbishop of Canterbury	999
	She had all the royal makings of a queen;	999
	As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,	999
	The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems	999
	Laid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,	999
	With all the choicest music of the kingdom,	999
	Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,	999
	And with the same full state paced back again	999
	To York-place, where the feast is held.	999
	999
First Gentleman	Sir,	999
	You must no more call it York-place, that's past;	999
	For, since the cardinal fell, that title's lost:	999
	'Tis now the king's, and call'd Whitehall.	999
	999
Third Gentleman	I know it;	999
	But 'tis so lately alter'd, that the old name	999
	Is fresh about me.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	                  What two reverend bishops	999
	Were those that went on each side of the queen?	999
	999
Third Gentleman	Stokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,	999
	Newly preferr'd from the king's secretary,	999
	The other, London.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	                  He of Winchester	999
	Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's,	999
	The virtuous Cranmer.	999
	999
Third Gentleman	All the land knows that:	999
	However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,	999
	Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	Who may that be, I pray you?	999
	999
Third Gentleman	Thomas Cromwell;	999
	A man in much esteem with the king, and truly	999
	A worthy friend. The king has made him master	999
	O' the jewel house,	999
	And one, already, of the privy council.	999
	999
Second Gentleman	He will deserve more.	999
	999
Third Gentleman	Yes, without all doubt.	999
	Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which	999
	Is to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:	999
	Something I can command. As I walk thither,	999
	I'll tell ye more.	999
	999
Both	                  You may command us, sir.	999

	999
SCENE II	Kimbolton.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KATHARINE, Dowager, sick; led between	999
	GRIFFITH, her gentleman usher, and PATIENCE, her woman]	999
	999
GRIFFITH	How does your grace?	999
	999
KATHARINE	O Griffith, sick to death!	999
	My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,	999
	Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:	999
	So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.	999
	Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,	999
	That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?	999
	999
GRIFFITH	        Yes, madam; but I think your grace,	999
	Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:	999
	If well, he stepp'd before me, happily	999
	For my example.	999
	999
GRIFFITH	                  Well, the voice goes, madam:	999
	For after the stout Earl Northumberland	999
	Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,	999
	As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,	999
	He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill	999
	He could not sit his mule.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Alas, poor man!	999
	999
GRIFFITH	At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,	999
	Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,	999
	With all his covent, honourably received him;	999
	To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,	999
	An old man, broken with the storms of state,	999
	Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;	999
	Give him a little earth for charity!'	999
	So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness	999
	Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,	999
	About the hour of eight, which he himself	999
	Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,	999
	Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,	999
	He gave his honours to the world again,	999
	His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.	999
	999
KATHARINE	So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!	999
	Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,	999
	And yet with charity. He was a man	999
	Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking	999
	Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,	999
	Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;	999
	His own opinion was his law: i' the presence	999
	He would say untruths; and be ever double	999
	Both in his words and meaning: he was never,	999
	But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:	999
	His promises were, as he then was, mighty;	999
	But his performance, as he is now, nothing:	999
	Of his own body he was ill, and gave	999
	The clergy in example.	999
	999
GRIFFITH	Noble madam,	999
	Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues	999
	We write in water. May it please your highness	999
	To hear me speak his good now?	999
	999
KATHARINE	Yes, good Griffith;	999
	I were malicious else.	999
	999
GRIFFITH	This cardinal,	999
	Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly	999
	Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.	999
	He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;	999
	Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:	999
	Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;	999
	But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.	999
	And though he were unsatisfied in getting,	999
	Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,	999
	He was most princely: ever witness for him	999
	Those twins Of learning that he raised in you,	999
	Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,	999
	Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;	999
	The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,	999
	So excellent in art, and still so rising,	999
	That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.	999
	His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;	999
	For then, and not till then, he felt himself,	999
	And found the blessedness of being little:	999
	And, to add greater honours to his age	999
	Than man could give him, he died fearing God.	999
	999
KATHARINE	After my death I wish no other herald,	999
	No other speaker of my living actions,	999
	To keep mine honour from corruption,	999
	But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.	999
	Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,	999
	With thy religious truth and modesty,	999
	Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!	999
	Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:	999
	I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,	999
	Cause the musicians play me that sad note	999
	I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating	999
	On that celestial harmony I go to.	999
	999
	[Sad and solemn music]	999
	999
GRIFFITH	She is asleep: good wench, let's sit down quiet,	999
	For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.	999
	999
	[The vision. Enter, solemnly tripping one after	999
	another, six personages, clad in white robes,	999
	wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden	999
	vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in	999
	their hands. They first congee unto her, then	999
	dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold	999
	a spare garland over her head; at which the other	999
	four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held	999
	the garland deliver the same to the other next two,	999
	who observe the same order in their changes, and	999
	holding the garland over her head: which done,	999
	they deliver the same garland to the last two, who	999
	likewise observe the same order: at which, as it	999
	were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs	999
	of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven:	999
	and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the	999
	garland with them. The music continues]	999
	999
KATHARINE	Spirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all gone,	999
	And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?	999
	999
GRIFFITH	Madam, we are here.	999
	999
KATHARINE	It is not you I call for:	999
	Saw ye none enter since I slept?	999
	999
GRIFFITH	None, madam.	999
	999
KATHARINE	No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop	999
	Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces	999
	Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?	999
	They promised me eternal happiness;	999
	And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel	999
	I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.	999
	999
GRIFFITH	I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams	999
	Possess your fancy.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Bid the music leave,	999
	They are harsh and heavy to me.	999
	999
	[Music ceases]	999
	999
PATIENCE	Do you note	999
	How much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?	999
	How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,	999
	And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!	999
	999
GRIFFITH	She is going, wench: pray, pray.	999
	999
PATIENCE	Heaven comfort her!	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	An't like your grace,--	999
	999
KATHARINE	You are a saucy fellow:	999
	Deserve we no more reverence?	999
	999
GRIFFITH	You are to blame,	999
	Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,	999
	To use so rude behavior; go to, kneel.	999
	999
Messenger	I humbly do entreat your highness' pardon;	999
	My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying	999
	A gentleman, sent from the king, to see you.	999
	999
KATHARINE	Admit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellow	999
	Let me ne'er see again.	999
	999
	[Exeunt GRIFFITH and Messenger]	999
	999
	[Re-enter GRIFFITH, with CAPUCIUS]	999
	999
		 If my sight fail not,	999
	You should be lord ambassador from the emperor,	999
	My royal nephew, and your name Capucius.	999
	999
CAPUCIUS	Madam, the same; your servant.	999
	999
KATHARINE	O, my lord,	999
	The times and titles now are alter'd strangely	999
	With me since first you knew me. But, I pray you,	999
	What is your pleasure with me?	999
	999
CAPUCIUS	Noble lady,	999
	First mine own service to your grace; the next,	999
	The king's request that I would visit you;	999
	Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me	999
	Sends you his princely commendations,	999
	And heartily entreats you take good comfort.	999
	999
KATHARINE	O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;	999
	'Tis like a pardon after execution:	999
	That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;	999
	But now I am past an comforts here, but prayers.	999
	How does his highness?	999
	999
CAPUCIUS	Madam, in good health.	999
	999
KATHARINE	So may he ever do! and ever flourish,	999
	When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name	999
	Banish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter,	999
	I caused you write, yet sent away?	999
	999
PATIENCE	No, madam.	999
	999
	[Giving it to KATHARINE]	999
	999
KATHARINE	Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver	999
	This to my lord the king.	999
	999
CAPUCIUS	Most willing, madam.	999
	999
KATHARINE	In which I have commended to his goodness	999
	The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter;	999
	The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!	999
	Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--	999
	She is young, and of a noble modest nature,	999
	I hope she will deserve well,--and a little	999
	To love her for her mother's sake, that loved him,	999
	Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition	999
	Is, that his noble grace would have some pity	999
	Upon my wretched women, that so long	999
	Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:	999
	Of which there is not one, I dare avow,	999
	And now I should not lie, but will deserve	999
	For virtue and true beauty of the soul,	999
	For honesty and decent carriage,	999
	A right good husband, let him be a noble	999
	And, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.	999
	The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,	999
	But poverty could never draw 'em from me;	999
	That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,	999
	And something over to remember me by:	999
	If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life	999
	And able means, we had not parted thus.	999
	These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,	999
	By that you love the dearest in this world,	999
	As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,	999
	Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the king	999
	To do me this last right.	999
	999
CAPUCIUS	By heaven, I will,	999
	Or let me lose the fashion of a man!	999
	999
KATHARINE	I thank you, honest lord. Remember me	999
	In all humility unto his highness:	999
	Say his long trouble now is passing	999
	Out of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him,	999
	For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,	999
	My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,	999
	You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;	999
	Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,	999
	Let me be used with honour: strew me over	999
	With maiden flowers, that all the world may know	999
	I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,	999
	Then lay me forth: although unqueen'd, yet like	999
	A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.	999
	I can no more.	999

SCENE I	London. A gallery in the palace.	999

	999
	[Enter GARDINER, Bishop of Winchester, a Page with a	999
	torch before him, met by LOVELL]	999
	999
GARDINER	It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?	999
	999
Boy	It hath struck.	999
	999
GARDINER	These should be hours for necessities,	999
	Not for delights; times to repair our nature	999
	With comforting repose, and not for us	999
	To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!	999
	Whither so late?	999
	999
LOVELL	                  Came you from the king, my lord	999
	999
GARDINER	I did, Sir Thomas: and left him at primero	999
	With the Duke of Suffolk.	999
	999
LOVELL	I must to him too,	999
	Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave.	999
	999
GARDINER	Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What's the matter?	999
	It seems you are in haste: an if there be	999
	No great offence belongs to't, give your friend	999
	Some touch of your late business: affairs, that walk,	999
	As they say spirits do, at midnight, have	999
	In them a wilder nature than the business	999
	That seeks dispatch by day.	999
	999
LOVELL	My lord, I love you;	999
	And durst commend a secret to your ear	999
	Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour,	999
	They say, in great extremity; and fear'd	999
	She'll with the labour end.	999
	999
GARDINER	The fruit she goes with	999
	I pray for heartily, that it may find	999
	Good time, and live: but for the stock, Sir Thomas,	999
	I wish it grubb'd up now.	999
	999
LOVELL	Methinks I could	999
	Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says	999
	She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does	999
	Deserve our better wishes.	999
	999
GARDINER	But, sir, sir,	999
	Hear me, Sir Thomas: you're a gentleman	999
	Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious;	999
	And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well,	999
	'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me,	999
	Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she,	999
	Sleep in their graves.	999
	999
LOVELL	Now, sir, you speak of two	999
	The most remark'd i' the kingdom. As for Cromwell,	999
	Beside that of the jewel house, is made master	999
	O' the rolls, and the king's secretary; further, sir,	999
	Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,	999
	With which the time will load him. The archbishop	999
	Is the king's hand and tongue; and who dare speak	999
	One syllable against him?	999
	999
GARDINER	Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,	999
	There are that dare; and I myself have ventured	999
	To speak my mind of him: and indeed this day,	999
	Sir, I may tell it you, I think I have	999
	Incensed the lords o' the council, that he is,	999
	For so I know he is, they know he is,	999
	A most arch heretic, a pestilence	999
	That does infect the land: with which they moved	999
	Have broken with the king; who hath so far	999
	Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace	999
	And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs	999
	Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded	999
	To-morrow morning to the council-board	999
	He be convented. He's a rank weed, Sir Thomas,	999
	And we must root him out. From your affairs	999
	I hinder you too long: good night, Sir Thomas.	999
	999
LOVELL	Many good nights, my lord: I rest your servant.	999
	999
	[Exeunt GARDINER and Page]	999
	999
	[Enter KING HENRY VIII and SUFFOLK]	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Charles, I will play no more tonight;	999
	My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Sir, I did never win of you before.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	But little, Charles;	999
	Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play.	999
	Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?	999
	999
LOVELL	I could not personally deliver to her	999
	What you commanded me, but by her woman	999
	I sent your message; who return'd her thanks	999
	In the great'st humbleness, and desired your highness	999
	Most heartily to pray for her.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	What say'st thou, ha?	999
	To pray for her? what, is she crying out?	999
	999
LOVELL	So said her woman; and that her sufferance made	999
	Almost each pang a death.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Alas, good lady!	999
	999
SUFFOLK	God safely quit her of her burthen, and	999
	With gentle travail, to the gladding of	999
	Your highness with an heir!	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	'Tis midnight, Charles;	999
	Prithee, to bed; and in thy prayers remember	999
	The estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone;	999
	For I must think of that which company	999
	Would not be friendly to.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	I wish your highness	999
	A quiet night; and my good mistress will	999
	Remember in my prayers.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Charles, good night.	999
	999
	[Exit SUFFOLK]	999
	999
	[Enter DENNY]	999
	999
	Well, sir, what follows?	999
	999
DENNY	Sir, I have brought my lord the archbishop,	999
	As you commanded me.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Ha! Canterbury?	999
	999
DENNY	Ay, my good lord.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	'Tis true: where is he, Denny?	999
	999
DENNY	He attends your highness' pleasure.	999
	999
	[Exit DENNY]	999
	999
LOVELL	[Aside]  This is about that which the bishop spake:	999
	I am happily come hither.	999
	999
	[Re-enter DENNY, with CRANMER]	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Avoid the gallery.	999
	999
	[LOVELL seems to stay]	999
	999
	Ha! I have said. Be gone. What!	999
	999
	[Exeunt LOVELL and DENNY]	999
	999
CRANMER	[Aside]	999
	I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?	999
	'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	How now, my lord! you desire to know	999
	Wherefore I sent for you.	999
	999
CRANMER	[Kneeling]              It is my duty	999
	To attend your highness' pleasure.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Pray you, arise,	999
	My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.	999
	Come, you and I must walk a turn together;	999
	I have news to tell you: come, come, give me your hand.	999
	Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,	999
	And am right sorry to repeat what follows	999
	I have, and most unwillingly, of late	999
	Heard many grievous, I do say, my lord,	999
	Grievous complaints of you; which, being consider'd,	999
	Have moved us and our council, that you shall	999
	This morning come before us; where, I know,	999
	You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,	999
	But that, till further trial in those charges	999
	Which will require your answer, you must take	999
	Your patience to you, and be well contented	999
	To make your house our Tower: you a brother of us,	999
	It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness	999
	Would come against you.	999
	999
CRANMER	[Kneeling]	999
	999
		  I humbly thank your highness;	999
	And am right glad to catch this good occasion	999
	Most throughly to be winnow'd, where my chaff	999
	And corn shall fly asunder: for, I know,	999
	There's none stands under more calumnious tongues	999
	Than I myself, poor man.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Stand up, good Canterbury:	999
	Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted	999
	In us, thy friend: give me thy hand, stand up:	999
	Prithee, let's walk. Now, by my holidame.	999
	What manner of man are you? My lord, I look'd	999
	You would have given me your petition, that	999
	I should have ta'en some pains to bring together	999
	Yourself and your accusers; and to have heard you,	999
	Without indurance, further.	999
	999
CRANMER	Most dread liege,	999
	The good I stand on is my truth and honesty:	999
	If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,	999
	Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,	999
	Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing	999
	What can be said against me.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Know you not	999
	How your state stands i' the world, with the whole world?	999
	Your enemies are many, and not small; their practises	999
	Must bear the same proportion; and not ever	999
	The justice and the truth o' the question carries	999
	The due o' the verdict with it: at what ease	999
	Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt	999
	To swear against you? such things have been done.	999
	You are potently opposed; and with a malice	999
	Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,	999
	I mean, in perjured witness, than your master,	999
	Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived	999
	Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to;	999
	You take a precipice for no leap of danger,	999
	And woo your own destruction.	999
	999
CRANMER	God and your majesty	999
	Protect mine innocence, or I fall into	999
	The trap is laid for me!	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Be of good cheer;	999
	They shall no more prevail than we give way to.	999
	Keep comfort to you; and this morning see	999
	You do appear before them: if they shall chance,	999
	In charging you with matters, to commit you,	999
	The best persuasions to the contrary	999
	Fail not to use, and with what vehemency	999
	The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties	999
	Will render you no remedy, this ring	999
	Deliver them, and your appeal to us	999
	There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!	999
	He's honest, on mine honour. God's blest mother!	999
	I swear he is true--hearted; and a soul	999
	None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,	999
	And do as I have bid you.	999
	999
	[Exit CRANMER]	999

		    He has strangled	999
	His language in his tears.	999
	999
	[Enter Old Lady, LOVELL following]	999
	999
Gentleman	[Within]                 Come back: what mean you?	999
	999
Old Lady	I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring	999
	Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels	999
	Fly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person	999
	Under their blessed wings!	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Now, by thy looks	999
	I guess thy message. Is the queen deliver'd?	999
	Say, ay; and of a boy.	999
	999
Old Lady	Ay, ay, my liege;	999
	And of a lovely boy: the God of heaven	999
	Both now and ever bless her! 'tis a girl,	999
	Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen	999
	Desires your visitation, and to be	999
	Acquainted with this stranger 'tis as like you	999
	As cherry is to cherry.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Lovell!	999
	999
LOVELL	Sir?	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
Old Lady	An hundred marks! By this light, I'll ha' more.	999
	An ordinary groom is for such payment.	999
	I will have more, or scold it out of him.	999
	Said I for this, the girl was like to him?	999
	I will have more, or else unsay't; and now,	999
	While it is hot, I'll put it to the issue.	999

	999
CRANMER	I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman,	999
	That was sent to me from the council, pray'd me	999
	To make great haste. All fast? what means this? Ho!	999
	Who waits there? Sure, you know me?	999
	999
	[Enter Keeper]	999
	999
Keeper	Yes, my lord;	999
	But yet I cannot help you.	999
	999
CRANMER	Why?	999
	999
	[Enter DOCTOR BUTTS]	999
	999
Keeper	Your grace must wait till you be call'd for.	999
	999
CRANMER	So.	999
	999
DOCTOR BUTTS	[Aside]  This is a piece of malice. I am glad	999
	I came this way so happily: the king	999
	Shall understand it presently.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CRANMER	[Aside]	'Tis Butts,	999
	The king's physician: as he pass'd along,	999
	How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!	999
	Pray heaven, he sound not my disgrace! For certain,	999
	This is of purpose laid by some that hate me--	999
	God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice--	999
	To quench mine honour: they would shame to make me	999
	Wait else at door, a fellow-counsellor,	999
	'Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures	999
	Must be fulfill'd, and I attend with patience.	999
	999
	[Enter the KING HENRY VIII and DOCTOR BUTTS at a window above]	999
	999
DOCTOR BUTTS	I'll show your grace the strangest sight--	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	What's that, Butts?	999
	999
DOCTOR BUTTS	I think your highness saw this many a day.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Body o' me, where is it?	999
	999
DOCTOR BUTTS	There, my lord:	999
	The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury;	999
	Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants,	999
	Pages, and footboys.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Ha! 'tis he, indeed:	999
	Is this the honour they do one another?	999
	'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought	999
	They had parted so much honesty among 'em	999
	At least, good manners, as not thus to suffer	999
	A man of his place, and so near our favour,	999
	To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures,	999
	And at the door too, like a post with packets.	999
	By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery:	999
	Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:	999
	We shall hear more anon.	999

	NORFOLK, SURREY, Chamberlain, GARDINER, seat	999
	themselves in order on each side. CROMWELL at	999
	lower end, as secretary. Keeper at the door]	999
	999
Chancellor	Speak to the business, master-secretary:	999
	Why are we met in council?	999
	999
CROMWELL	Please your honours,	999
	The chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury.	999
	999
GARDINER	Has he had knowledge of it?	999
	999
CROMWELL	Yes.	999
	999
NORFOLK	Who waits there?	999
	999
Keeper	Without, my noble lords?	999
	999
GARDINER	Yes.	999
	999
Keeper	My lord archbishop;	999
	And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.	999
	999
Chancellor	Let him come in.	999
	999
Keeper	                  Your grace may enter now.	999
	999
	[CRANMER enters and approaches the council-table]	999
	999
Chancellor	My good lord archbishop, I'm very sorry	999
	To sit here at this present, and behold	999
	That chair stand empty: but we all are men,	999
	In our own natures frail, and capable	999
	Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty	999
	And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,	999
	Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,	999
	Toward the king first, then his laws, in filling	999
	The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains,	999
	For so we are inform'd, with new opinions,	999
	Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,	999
	And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.	999
	999
GARDINER	Which reformation must be sudden too,	999
	My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses	999
	Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,	999
	But stop their mouths with stubborn bits, and spur 'em,	999
	Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,	999
	Out of our easiness and childish pity	999
	To one man's honour, this contagious sickness,	999
	Farewell all physic: and what follows then?	999
	Commotions, uproars, with a general taint	999
	Of the whole state: as, of late days, our neighbours,	999
	The upper Germany, can dearly witness,	999
	Yet freshly pitied in our memories.	999
	999
CRANMER	My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress	999
	Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,	999
	And with no little study, that my teaching	999
	And the strong course of my authority	999
	Might go one way, and safely; and the end	999
	Was ever, to do well: nor is there living,	999
	I speak it with a single heart, my lords,	999
	A man that more detests, more stirs against,	999
	Both in his private conscience and his place,	999
	Defacers of a public peace, than I do.	999
	Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart	999
	With less allegiance in it! Men that make	999
	Envy and crooked malice nourishment	999
	Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,	999
	That, in this case of justice, my accusers,	999
	Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,	999
	And freely urge against me.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	Nay, my lord,	999
	That cannot be: you are a counsellor,	999
	And, by that virtue, no man dare accuse you.	999
	999
GARDINER	My lord, because we have business of more moment,	999
	We will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure,	999
	And our consent, for better trial of you,	999
	From hence you be committed to the Tower;	999
	Where, being but a private man again,	999
	You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,	999
	More than, I fear, you are provided for.	999
	999
CRANMER	Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;	999
	You are always my good friend; if your will pass,	999
	I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,	999
	You are so merciful: I see your end;	999
	'Tis my undoing: love and meekness, lord,	999
	Become a churchman better than ambition:	999
	Win straying souls with modesty again,	999
	Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,	999
	Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,	999
	I make as little doubt, as you do conscience	999
	In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,	999
	But reverence to your calling makes me modest.	999
	999
GARDINER	My lord, my lord, you are a sectary,	999
	That's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers,	999
	To men that understand you, words and weakness.	999
	999
CROMWELL	My Lord of Winchester, you are a little,	999
	By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,	999
	However faulty, yet should find respect	999
	For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty	999
	To load a falling man.	999
	999
GARDINER	Good master secretary,	999
	I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst	999
	Of all this table, say so.	999
	999
CROMWELL	Why, my lord?	999
	999
GARDINER	Do not I know you for a favourer	999
	Of this new sect? ye are not sound.	999
	999
CROMWELL	Not sound?	999
	999
GARDINER	Not sound, I say.	999
	999
CROMWELL	                  Would you were half so honest!	999
	Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.	999
	999
GARDINER	I shall remember this bold language.	999
	999
CROMWELL	Do.	999
	Remember your bold life too.	999
	999
Chancellor	This is too much;	999
	Forbear, for shame, my lords.	999
	999
GARDINER	I have done.	999
	999
CROMWELL	And I.	999
	999
Chancellor	Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,	999
	I take it, by all voices, that forthwith	999
	You be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner;	999
	There to remain till the king's further pleasure	999
	Be known unto us: are you all agreed, lords?	999
	999
All	We are.	999
	999
CRANMER	      Is there no other way of mercy,	999
	But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?	999
	999
GARDINER	What other	999
	Would you expect? you are strangely troublesome.	999
	Let some o' the guard be ready there.	999
	999
	[Enter Guard]	999
	999
CRANMER	For me?	999
	Must I go like a traitor thither?	999
	999
GARDINER	Receive him,	999
	And see him safe i' the Tower.	999
	999
CRANMER	Stay, good my lords,	999
	I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;	999
	By virtue of that ring, I take my cause	999
	Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it	999
	To a most noble judge, the king my master.	999
	999
Chamberlain	This is the king's ring.	999
	999
SURREY	'Tis no counterfeit.	999
	999
SUFFOLK	'Tis the right ring, by heaven: I told ye all,	999
	When ye first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,	999
	'Twould fall upon ourselves.	999
	999
NORFOLK	Do you think, my lords,	999
	The king will suffer but the little finger	999
	Of this man to be vex'd?	999
	999
Chancellor	'Tis now too certain:	999
	How much more is his life in value with him?	999
	Would I were fairly out on't!	999
	999
CROMWELL	My mind gave me,	999
	In seeking tales and informations	999
	Against this man, whose honesty the devil	999
	And his disciples only envy at,	999
	Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!	999
	999
	[Enter KING, frowning on them; takes his seat]	999
	999
GARDINER	Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven	999
	In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;	999
	Not only good and wise, but most religious:	999
	One that, in all obedience, makes the church	999
	The chief aim of his honour; and, to strengthen	999
	That holy duty, out of dear respect,	999
	His royal self in judgment comes to hear	999
	The cause betwixt her and this great offender.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	You were ever good at sudden commendations,	999
	Bishop of Winchester. But know, I come not	999
	To hear such flattery now, and in my presence;	999
	They are too thin and bare to hide offences.	999
	To me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel,	999
	And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;	999
	But, whatsoe'er thou takest me for, I'm sure	999
	Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.	999
	999
	[To CRANMER]	999
	999
	Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest	999
	He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee:	999
	By all that's holy, he had better starve	999
	Than but once think this place becomes thee not.	999
	999
SURREY	May it please your grace,--	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	No, sir, it does not please me.	999
	I had thought I had had men of some understanding	999
	And wisdom of my council; but I find none.	999
	Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,	999
	This good man,--few of you deserve that title,--	999
	This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy	999
	At chamber--door? and one as great as you are?	999
	Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission	999
	Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye	999
	Power as he was a counsellor to try him,	999
	Not as a groom: there's some of ye, I see,	999
	More out of malice than integrity,	999
	Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;	999
	Which ye shall never have while I live.	999
	999
Chancellor	Thus far,	999
	My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace	999
	To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed	999
	Concerning his imprisonment, was rather,	999
	If there be faith in men, meant for his trial,	999
	And fair purgation to the world, than malice,	999
	I'm sure, in me.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Well, well, my lords, respect him;	999
	Take him, and use him well, he's worthy of it.	999
	I will say thus much for him, if a prince	999
	May be beholding to a subject, I	999
	Am, for his love and service, so to him.	999
	Make me no more ado, but all embrace him:	999
	Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of	999
	Canterbury,	999
	I have a suit which you must not deny me;	999
	That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,	999
	You must be godfather, and answer for her.	999
	999
CRANMER	The greatest monarch now alive may glory	999
	In such an honour: how may I deserve it	999
	That am a poor and humble subject to you?	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Come, come, my lord, you'ld spare your spoons: you	999
	shall have two noble partners with you; the old	999
	Duchess of Norfolk, and Lady Marquess Dorset: will	999
	these please you?	999
	Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,	999
	Embrace and love this man.	999
	999
GARDINER	With a true heart	999
	And brother-love I do it.	999
	999
CRANMER	And let heaven	999
	Witness, how dear I hold this confirmation.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:	999
	The common voice, I see, is verified	999
	Of thee, which says thus, 'Do my Lord of Canterbury	999
	A shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.'	999
	Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long	999
	To have this young one made a Christian.	999
	As I have made ye one, lords, one remain;	999
	So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.	999

	999
	999
	[Noise and tumult within. Enter Porter and his Man]	999
	999
Porter	You'll leave your noise anon, ye rascals: do you	999
	take the court for Paris-garden? ye rude slaves,	999
	leave your gaping.	999
	999
	[Within]	999
	999
	Good master porter, I belong to the larder.	999
	999
Porter	Belong to the gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue! is	999
	this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree	999
	staves, and strong ones: these are but switches to	999
	'em. I'll scratch your heads: you must be seeing	999
	christenings? do you look for ale and cakes here,	999
	you rude rascals?	999
	999
Man	Pray, sir, be patient: 'tis as much impossible--	999
	Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons--	999
	To scatter 'em, as 'tis to make 'em sleep	999
	On May-day morning; which will never be:	999
	We may as well push against Powle's, as stir em.	999
	999
Porter	How got they in, and be hang'd?	999
	999
Man	Alas, I know not; how gets the tide in?	999
	As much as one sound cudgel of four foot--	999
	You see the poor remainder--could distribute,	999
	I made no spare, sir.	999
	999
Porter	You did nothing, sir.	999
	999
Man	I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,	999
	To mow 'em down before me: but if I spared any	999
	That had a head to hit, either young or old,	999
	He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,	999
	Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again	999
	And that I would not for a cow, God save her!	999
	999
	[Within]	999
	999
	Do you hear, master porter?	999
	999
Porter	I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.	999
	Keep the door close, sirrah.	999
	999
Man	What would you have me do?	999
	999
Porter	What should you do, but knock 'em down by the	999
	dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? or have	999
	we some strange Indian with the great tool come to	999
	court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a	999
	fry of fornication is at door! On my Christian	999
	conscience, this one christening will beget a	999
	thousand; here will be father, godfather, and all together.	999
	999
Man	The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a	999
	fellow somewhat near the door, he should be a	999
	brazier by his face, for, o' my conscience, twenty	999
	of the dog-days now reign in's nose; all that stand	999
	about him are under the line, they need no other	999
	penance: that fire-drake did I hit three times on	999
	the head, and three times was his nose discharged	999
	against me; he stands there, like a mortar-piece, to	999
	blow us. There was a haberdasher's wife of small	999
	wit near him, that railed upon me till her pinked	999
	porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a	999
	combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once,	999
	and hit that woman; who cried out 'Clubs!' when I	999
	might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to	999
	her succor, which were the hope o' the Strand, where	999
	she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my	999
	place: at length they came to the broom-staff to	999
	me; I defied 'em still: when suddenly a file of	999
	boys behind 'em, loose shot, delivered such a shower	999
	of pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honour in,	999
	and let 'em win the work: the devil was amongst	999
	'em, I think, surely.	999
	999
Porter	These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse,	999
	and fight for bitten apples; that no audience, but	999
	the tribulation of Tower-hill, or the limbs of	999
	Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure.	999
	I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum, and there they	999
	are like to dance these three days; besides the	999
	running banquet of two beadles that is to come.	999
	999
	[Enter Chamberlain]	999
	999
Chamberlain	Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here!	999
	They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,	999
	As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,	999
	These lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:	999
	There's a trim rabble let in: are all these	999
	Your faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall have	999
	Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,	999
	When they pass back from the christening.	999
	999
Porter	An't please	999
	your honour,	999
	We are but men; and what so many may do,	999
	Not being torn a-pieces, we have done:	999
	An army cannot rule 'em.	999
	999
Chamberlain	As I live,	999
	If the king blame me for't, I'll lay ye all	999
	By the heels, and suddenly; and on your heads	999
	Clap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;	999
	And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when	999
	Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;	999
	They're come already from the christening:	999
	Go, break among the press, and find a way out	999
	To let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find	999
	A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.	999
	999
Porter	Make way there for the princess.	999
	999
Man	You great fellow,	999
	Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache.	999
	999
Porter	You i' the camlet, get up o' the rail;	999
	I'll peck you o'er the pales else.	999

	999
Garter	Heaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperous	999
	life, long, and ever happy, to the high and mighty	999
	princess of England, Elizabeth!	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VIII and Guard]	999
	999
CRANMER	[Kneeling] And to your royal grace, and the good queen,	999
	My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:	999
	All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,	999
	Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,	999
	May hourly fall upon ye!	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Thank you, good lord archbishop:	999
	What is her name?	999
	999
CRANMER	                  Elizabeth.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Stand up, lord.	999
	999
	[KING HENRY VIII kisses the child]	999
	999
	With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!	999
	Into whose hand I give thy life.	999
	999
CRANMER	Amen.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:	999
	I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,	999
	When she has so much English.	999
	999
CRANMER	Let me speak, sir,	999
	For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter	999
	Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.	999
	This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--	999
	Though in her cradle, yet now promises	999
	Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,	999
	Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--	999
	But few now living can behold that goodness--	999
	A pattern to all princes living with her,	999
	And all that shall succeed: Saba was never	999
	More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue	999
	Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,	999
	That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,	999
	With all the virtues that attend the good,	999
	Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,	999
	Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:	999
	She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;	999
	Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,	999
	And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:	999
	In her days every man shall eat in safety,	999
	Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing	999
	The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:	999
	God shall be truly known; and those about her	999
	From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,	999
	And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.	999
	Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when	999
	The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,	999
	Her ashes new create another heir,	999
	As great in admiration as herself;	999
	So shall she leave her blessedness to one,	999
	When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,	999
	Who from the sacred ashes of her honour	999
	Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,	999
	And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,	999
	That were the servants to this chosen infant,	999
	Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:	999
	Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,	999
	His honour and the greatness of his name	999
	Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,	999
	And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches	999
	To all the plains about him: our children's children	999
	Shall see this, and bless heaven.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	Thou speakest wonders.	999
	999
CRANMER	She shall be, to the happiness of England,	999
	An aged princess; many days shall see her,	999
	And yet no day without a deed to crown it.	999
	Would I had known no more! but she must die,	999
	She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,	999
	A most unspotted lily shall she pass	999
	To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.	999
	999
KING HENRY VIII	O lord archbishop,	999
	Thou hast made me now a man! never, before	999
	This happy child, did I get any thing:	999
	This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,	999
	That when I am in heaven I shall desire	999
	To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.	999
	I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,	999
	And your good brethren, I am much beholding;	999
	I have received much honour by your presence,	999
	And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:	999
	Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,	999
	She will be sick else. This day, no man think	999
	Has business at his house; for all shall stay:	999
	This little one shall make it holiday.	999

	999
	999
	'Tis ten to one this play can never please	999
	All that are here: some come to take their ease,	999
	And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,	999
	We have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,	999
	They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the city	999
	Abused extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'	999
	Which we have not done neither: that, I fear,	999
	All the expected good we're like to hear	999
	For this play at this time, is only in	999
	The merciful construction of good women;	999
	For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,	999
	And say 'twill do, I know, within a while	999
	All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap,	999
	If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.	999

	To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,	999
	Desiring thee to lay aside the sword	999
	Which sways usurpingly these several titles,	999
	And put these same into young Arthur's hand,	999
	Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.	999
	999
KING JOHN	What follows if we disallow of this?	999
	999
CHATILLON	The proud control of fierce and bloody war,	999
	To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Here have we war for war and blood for blood,	999
	Controlment for controlment: so answer France.	999
	999
CHATILLON	Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,	999
	The farthest limit of my embassy.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:	999
	Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;	999
	For ere thou canst report I will be there,	999
	The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:	999
	So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath	999
	And sullen presage of your own decay.	999
	An honourable conduct let him have:	999
	Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.	999
	999
	[Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE]	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	What now, my son! have I not ever said	999
	How that ambitious Constance would not cease	999
	Till she had kindled France and all the world,	999
	Upon the right and party of her son?	999
	This might have been prevented and made whole	999
	With very easy arguments of love,	999
	Which now the manage of two kingdoms must	999
	With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Our strong possession and our right for us.	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	Your strong possession much more than your right,	999
	Or else it must go wrong with you and me:	999
	So much my conscience whispers in your ear,	999
	Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.	999
	999
	[Enter a Sheriff]	999
	999
ESSEX	My liege, here is the strangest controversy	999
	Come from country to be judged by you,	999
	That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?	999
	999
KING JOHN	Let them approach.	999
	Our abbeys and our priories shall pay	999
	This expedition's charge.	999
	999
	[Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD]	999
	999
		    What men are you?	999
	999
BASTARD	Your faithful subject I, a gentleman	999
	Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,	999
	As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,	999
	A soldier, by the honour-giving hand	999
	Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.	999
	999
KING JOHN	What art thou?	999
	999
ROBERT	The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?	999
	You came not of one mother then, it seems.	999
	999
BASTARD	Most certain of one mother, mighty king;	999
	That is well known; and, as I think, one father:	999
	But for the certain knowledge of that truth	999
	I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:	999
	Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother	999
	And wound her honour with this diffidence.	999
	999
BASTARD	I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;	999
	That is my brother's plea and none of mine;	999
	The which if he can prove, a' pops me out	999
	At least from fair five hundred pound a year:	999
	Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!	999
	999
KING JOHN	A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,	999
	Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?	999
	999
BASTARD	I know not why, except to get the land.	999
	But once he slander'd me with bastardy:	999
	But whether I be as true begot or no,	999
	That still I lay upon my mother's head,	999
	But that I am as well begot, my liege,--	999
	Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--	999
	Compare our faces and be judge yourself.	999
	If old sir Robert did beget us both	999
	And were our father and this son like him,	999
	O old sir Robert, father, on my knee	999
	I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!	999
	999
KING JOHN	Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;	999
	The accent of his tongue affecteth him.	999
	Do you not read some tokens of my son	999
	In the large composition of this man?	999
	999
KING JOHN	Mine eye hath well examined his parts	999
	And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,	999
	What doth move you to claim your brother's land?	999
	999
BASTARD	Because he hath a half-face, like my father.	999
	With half that face would he have all my land:	999
	A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!	999
	999
ROBERT	My gracious liege, when that my father lived,	999
	Your brother did employ my father much,--	999
	999
BASTARD	Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:	999
	Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.	999
	999
ROBERT	And once dispatch'd him in an embassy	999
	To Germany, there with the emperor	999
	To treat of high affairs touching that time.	999
	The advantage of his absence took the king	999
	And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;	999
	Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,	999
	But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores	999
	Between my father and my mother lay,	999
	As I have heard my father speak himself,	999
	When this same lusty gentleman was got.	999
	Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd	999
	His lands to me, and took it on his death	999
	That this my mother's son was none of his;	999
	And if he were, he came into the world	999
	Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.	999
	Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,	999
	My father's land, as was my father's will.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;	999
	Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,	999
	And if she did play false, the fault was hers;	999
	Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands	999
	That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,	999
	Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,	999
	Had of your father claim'd this son for his?	999
	In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept	999
	This calf bred from his cow from all the world;	999
	In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,	999
	My brother might not claim him; nor your father,	999
	Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;	999
	My mother's son did get your father's heir;	999
	Your father's heir must have your father's land.	999
	999
ROBERT	Shall then my father's will be of no force	999
	To dispossess that child which is not his?	999
	999
BASTARD	Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,	999
	Than was his will to get me, as I think.	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge	999
	And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,	999
	Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,	999
	Lord of thy presence and no land beside?	999
	999
BASTARD	Madam, an if my brother had my shape,	999
	And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;	999
	And if my legs were two such riding-rods,	999
	My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin	999
	That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose	999
	Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'	999
	And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,	999
	Would I might never stir from off this place,	999
	I would give it every foot to have this face;	999
	I would not be sir Nob in any case.	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,	999
	Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?	999
	I am a soldier and now bound to France.	999
	999
BASTARD	Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.	999
	Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,	999
	Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.	999
	Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	Nay, I would have you go before me thither.	999
	999
BASTARD	Our country manners give our betters way.	999
	999
KING JOHN	What is thy name?	999
	999
BASTARD	Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,	999
	Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.	999
	999
KING JOHN	From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:	999
	Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,	999
	Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.	999
	999
BASTARD	Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:	999
	My father gave me honour, yours gave land.	999
	Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,	999
	When I was got, sir Robert was away!	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	The very spirit of Plantagenet!	999
	I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.	999
	999
BASTARD	Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?	999
	Something about, a little from the right,	999
	In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:	999
	Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,	999
	And have is have, however men do catch:	999
	Near or far off, well won is still well shot,	999
	And I am I, howe'er I was begot.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;	999
	A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.	999
	Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed	999
	For France, for France, for it is more than need.	999
	999
BASTARD	Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!	999
	For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but BASTARD]	999
	999
	A foot of honour better than I was;	999
	But many a many foot of land the worse.	999
	Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.	999
	'Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--	999
	And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;	999
	For new-made honour doth forget men's names;	999
	'Tis too respective and too sociable	999
	For your conversion. Now your traveller,	999
	He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,	999
	And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,	999
	Why then I suck my teeth and catechise	999
	My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'	999
	Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,	999
	'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;	999
	And then comes answer like an Absey book:	999
	'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;	999
	At your employment; at your service, sir;'	999
	'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'	999
	And so, ere answer knows what question would,	999
	Saving in dialogue of compliment,	999
	And talking of the Alps and Apennines,	999
	The Pyrenean and the river Po,	999
	It draws toward supper in conclusion so.	999
	But this is worshipful society	999
	And fits the mounting spirit like myself,	999
	For he is but a bastard to the time	999
	That doth not smack of observation;	999
	And so am I, whether I smack or no;	999
	And not alone in habit and device,	999
	Exterior form, outward accoutrement,	999
	But from the inward motion to deliver	999
	Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:	999
	Which, though I will not practise to deceive,	999
	Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;	999
	For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.	999
	But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?	999
	What woman-post is this? hath she no husband	999
	That will take pains to blow a horn before her?	999
	999
	[Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY]	999
	999
	O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!	999
	What brings you here to court so hastily?	999
	999
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,	999
	That holds in chase mine honour up and down?	999
	999
BASTARD	My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?	999
	Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?	999
	Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?	999
	999
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,	999
	Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?	999
	He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.	999
	999
BASTARD	James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?	999
	999
GURNEY	Good leave, good Philip.	999
	999
BASTARD	Philip! sparrow: James,	999
	There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.	999
	999
	[Exit GURNEY]	999
	999
	Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:	999
	Sir Robert might have eat his part in me	999
	Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:	999
	Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,	999
	Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:	999
	We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,	999
	To whom am I beholding for these limbs?	999
	Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.	999
	999
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,	999
	That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?	999
	What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?	999
	999
BASTARD	Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.	999
	What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.	999
	But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;	999
	I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;	999
	Legitimation, name and all is gone:	999
	Then, good my mother, let me know my father;	999
	Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?	999
	999
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?	999
	999
BASTARD	As faithfully as I deny the devil.	999
	999
LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:	999
	By long and vehement suit I was seduced	999
	To make room for him in my husband's bed:	999
	Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!	999
	Thou art the issue of my dear offence,	999
	Which was so strongly urged past my defence.	999
	999
BASTARD	Now, by this light, were I to get again,	999
	Madam, I would not wish a better father.	999
	Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,	999
	And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:	999
	Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,	999
	Subjected tribute to commanding love,	999
	Against whose fury and unmatched force	999
	The aweless lion could not wage the fight,	999
	Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.	999
	He that perforce robs lions of their hearts	999
	May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,	999
	With all my heart I thank thee for my father!	999
	Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well	999
	When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.	999
	Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;	999
	And they shall say, when Richard me begot,	999
	If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:	999
	Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.	999

ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	France. Before Angiers.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter AUSTRIA and forces, drums, etc. on one side:	999
	on the other KING PHILIP and his power; LEWIS,	999
	ARTHUR, CONSTANCE and attendants]	999
	999
LEWIS	Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.	999
	Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,	999
	Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart	999
	And fought the holy wars in Palestine,	999
	By this brave duke came early to his grave:	999
	And for amends to his posterity,	999
	At our importance hither is he come,	999
	To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,	999
	And to rebuke the usurpation	999
	Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:	999
	Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.	999
	999
ARTHUR	God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death	999
	The rather that you give his offspring life,	999
	Shadowing their right under your wings of war:	999
	I give you welcome with a powerless hand,	999
	But with a heart full of unstained love:	999
	Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.	999
	999
LEWIS	A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?	999
	999
AUSTRIA	Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,	999
	As seal to this indenture of my love,	999
	That to my home I will no more return,	999
	Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,	999
	Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,	999
	Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides	999
	And coops from other lands her islanders,	999
	Even till that England, hedged in with the main,	999
	That water-walled bulwark, still secure	999
	And confident from foreign purposes,	999
	Even till that utmost corner of the west	999
	Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,	999
	Will I not think of home, but follow arms.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,	999
	Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength	999
	To make a more requital to your love!	999
	999
AUSTRIA	The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords	999
	In such a just and charitable war.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent	999
	Against the brows of this resisting town.	999
	Call for our chiefest men of discipline,	999
	To cull the plots of best advantages:	999
	We'll lay before this town our royal bones,	999
	Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,	999
	But we will make it subject to this boy.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Stay for an answer to your embassy,	999
	Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:	999
	My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,	999
	That right in peace which here we urge in war,	999
	And then we shall repent each drop of blood	999
	That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.	999
	999
	[Enter CHATILLON]	999
	999
KING PHILIP	A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,	999
	Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!	999
	What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;	999
	We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.	999
	999
CHATILLON	Then turn your forces from this paltry siege	999
	And stir them up against a mightier task.	999
	England, impatient of your just demands,	999
	Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,	999
	Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time	999
	To land his legions all as soon as I;	999
	His marches are expedient to this town,	999
	His forces strong, his soldiers confident.	999
	With him along is come the mother-queen,	999
	An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;	999
	With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;	999
	With them a bastard of the king's deceased,	999
	And all the unsettled humours of the land,	999
	Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,	999
	With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,	999
	Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,	999
	Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,	999
	To make hazard of new fortunes here:	999
	In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits	999
	Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er	999
	Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,	999
	To do offence and scath in Christendom.	999
	999
	[Drum beats]	999
	999
	The interruption of their churlish drums	999
	Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,	999
	To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	How much unlook'd for is this expedition!	999
	999
AUSTRIA	By how much unexpected, by so much	999
	We must awake endavour for defence;	999
	For courage mounteth with occasion:	999
	Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.	999
	999
	[Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, BLANCH, the BASTARD,	999
	Lords, and forces]	999
	999
KING JOHN	Peace be to France, if France in peace permit	999
	Our just and lineal entrance to our own;	999
	If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,	999
	Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct	999
	Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Peace be to England, if that war return	999
	From France to England, there to live in peace.	999
	England we love; and for that England's sake	999
	With burden of our armour here we sweat.	999
	This toil of ours should be a work of thine;	999
	But thou from loving England art so far,	999
	That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king	999
	Cut off the sequence of posterity,	999
	Out-faced infant state and done a rape	999
	Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.	999
	Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;	999
	These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:	999
	This little abstract doth contain that large	999
	Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time	999
	Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.	999
	That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,	999
	And this his son; England was Geffrey's right	999
	And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God	999
	How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,	999
	When living blood doth in these temples beat,	999
	Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest?	999
	999
KING JOHN	From whom hast thou this great commission, France,	999
	To draw my answer from thy articles?	999
	999
KING PHILIP	From that supernal judge, that stirs good thoughts	999
	In any breast of strong authority,	999
	To look into the blots and stains of right:	999
	That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:	999
	Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong	999
	And by whose help I mean to chastise it.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Alack, thou dost usurp authority.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Let me make answer; thy usurping son.	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,	999
	That thou mayst be a queen, and cheque the world!	999
	999
CONSTANCE	My bed was ever to thy son as true	999
	As thine was to thy husband; and this boy	999
	Liker in feature to his father Geffrey	999
	Than thou and John in manners; being as like	999
	As rain to water, or devil to his dam.	999
	My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think	999
	His father never was so true begot:	999
	It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.	999
	999
AUSTRIA	Peace!	999
	999
BASTARD	     Hear the crier.	999
	999
AUSTRIA	What the devil art thou?	999
	999
BASTARD	One that will play the devil, sir, with you,	999
	An a' may catch your hide and you alone:	999
	You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,	999
	Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard;	999
	I'll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right;	999
	Sirrah, look to't; i' faith, I will, i' faith.	999
	999
BLANCH	O, well did he become that lion's robe	999
	That did disrobe the lion of that robe!	999
	999
BASTARD	It lies as sightly on the back of him	999
	As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:	999
	But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,	999
	Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.	999
	999
AUSTRIA	What craker is this same that deafs our ears	999
	With this abundance of superfluous breath?	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.	999
	999
LEWIS	Women and fools, break off your conference.	999
	King John, this is the very sum of all;	999
	England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,	999
	In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:	999
	Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?	999
	999
KING JOHN	My life as soon: I do defy thee, France.	999
	Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand;	999
	And out of my dear love I'll give thee more	999
	Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:	999
	Submit thee, boy.	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	                  Come to thy grandam, child.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Do, child, go to it grandam, child:	999
	Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will	999
	Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:	999
	There's a good grandam.	999
	999
ARTHUR	Good my mother, peace!	999
	I would that I were low laid in my grave:	999
	I am not worth this coil that's made for me.	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Now shame upon you, whether she does or no!	999
	His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,	999
	Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,	999
	Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;	999
	Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed	999
	To do him justice and revenge on you.	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!	999
	Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp	999
	The dominations, royalties and rights	999
	Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld'st son's son,	999
	Infortunate in nothing but in thee:	999
	Thy sins are visited in this poor child;	999
	The canon of the law is laid on him,	999
	Being but the second generation	999
	Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Bedlam, have done.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	                  I have but this to say,	999
	That he is not only plagued for her sin,	999
	But God hath made her sin and her the plague	999
	On this removed issue, plague for her	999
	And with her plague; her sin his injury,	999
	Her injury the beadle to her sin,	999
	All punish'd in the person of this child,	999
	And all for her; a plague upon her!	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	Thou unadvised scold, I can produce	999
	A will that bars the title of thy son.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Ay, who doubts that? a will! a wicked will:	999
	A woman's will; a canker'd grandam's will!	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate:	999
	It ill beseems this presence to cry aim	999
	To these ill-tuned repetitions.	999
	Some trumpet summon hither to the walls	999
	These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak	999
	Whose title they admit, Arthur's or John's.	999
	999
	[Trumpet sounds. Enter certain Citizens upon the walls]	999
	999
First Citizen	Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?	999
	999
KING PHILIP	'Tis France, for England.	999
	999
KING JOHN	England, for itself.	999
	You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects--	999
	999
KING PHILIP	You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,	999
	Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle--	999
	999
KING JOHN	For our advantage; therefore hear us first.	999
	These flags of France, that are advanced here	999
	Before the eye and prospect of your town,	999
	Have hither march'd to your endamagement:	999
	The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,	999
	And ready mounted are they to spit forth	999
	Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:	999
	All preparation for a bloody siege	999
	All merciless proceeding by these French	999
	Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;	999
	And but for our approach those sleeping stones,	999
	That as a waist doth girdle you about,	999
	By the compulsion of their ordinance	999
	By this time from their fixed beds of lime	999
	Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made	999
	For bloody power to rush upon your peace.	999
	But on the sight of us your lawful king,	999
	Who painfully with much expedient march	999
	Have brought a countercheque before your gates,	999
	To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,	999
	Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;	999
	And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,	999
	To make a shaking fever in your walls,	999
	They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,	999
	To make a faithless error in your ears:	999
	Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,	999
	And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,	999
	Forwearied in this action of swift speed,	999
	Crave harbourage within your city walls.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	When I have said, make answer to us both.	999
	Lo, in this right hand, whose protection	999
	Is most divinely vow'd upon the right	999
	Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,	999
	Son to the elder brother of this man,	999
	And king o'er him and all that he enjoys:	999
	For this down-trodden equity, we tread	999
	In warlike march these greens before your town,	999
	Being no further enemy to you	999
	Than the constraint of hospitable zeal	999
	In the relief of this oppressed child	999
	Religiously provokes. Be pleased then	999
	To pay that duty which you truly owe	999
	To that owes it, namely this young prince:	999
	And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,	999
	Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;	999
	Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent	999
	Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;	999
	And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,	999
	With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised,	999
	We will bear home that lusty blood again	999
	Which here we came to spout against your town,	999
	And leave your children, wives and you in peace.	999
	But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,	999
	'Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls	999
	Can hide you from our messengers of war,	999
	Though all these English and their discipline	999
	Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.	999
	Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,	999
	In that behalf which we have challenged it?	999
	Or shall we give the signal to our rage	999
	And stalk in blood to our possession?	999
	999
First Citizen	In brief, we are the king of England's subjects:	999
	For him, and in his right, we hold this town.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.	999
	999
First Citizen	That can we not; but he that proves the king,	999
	To him will we prove loyal: till that time	999
	Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Doth not the crown of England prove the king?	999
	And if not that, I bring you witnesses,	999
	Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--	999
	999
BASTARD	Bastards, and else.	999
	999
KING JOHN	To verify our title with their lives.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	As many and as well-born bloods as those,--	999
	999
BASTARD	Some bastards too.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Stand in his face to contradict his claim.	999
	999
First Citizen	Till you compound whose right is worthiest,	999
	We for the worthiest hold the right from both.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Then God forgive the sin of all those souls	999
	That to their everlasting residence,	999
	Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,	999
	In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Amen, amen! Mount, chevaliers! to arms!	999
	999
BASTARD	Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and e'er since	999
	Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door,	999
	Teach us some fence!	999
	999
	[To AUSTRIA]	999
	999
		Sirrah, were I at home,	999
	At your den, sirrah, with your lioness	999
	I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,	999
	And make a monster of you.	999
	999
AUSTRIA	Peace! no more.	999
	999
BASTARD	O tremble, for you hear the lion roar.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth	999
	In best appointment all our regiments.	999
	999
BASTARD	Speed then, to take advantage of the field.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	It shall be so; and at the other hill	999
	Command the rest to stand. God and our right!	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Here after excursions, enter the Herald of France,	999
	with trumpets, to the gates]	999
	999
French Herald	You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,	999
	And let young Arthur, Duke of Bretagne, in,	999
	Who by the hand of France this day hath made	999
	Much work for tears in many an English mother,	999
	Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;	999
	Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,	999
	Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;	999
	And victory, with little loss, doth play	999
	Upon the dancing banners of the French,	999
	Who are at hand, triumphantly display'd,	999
	To enter conquerors and to proclaim	999
	Arthur of Bretagne England's king and yours.	999
	999
	[Enter English Herald, with trumpet]	999
	999
English Herald	Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:	999
	King John, your king and England's doth approach,	999
	Commander of this hot malicious day:	999
	Their armours, that march'd hence so silver-bright,	999
	Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;	999
	There stuck no plume in any English crest	999
	That is removed by a staff of France;	999
	Our colours do return in those same hands	999
	That did display them when we first march'd forth;	999
	And, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come	999
	Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,	999
	Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:	999
	Open your gates and gives the victors way.	999
	999
First Citizen	Heralds, from off our towers we might behold,	999
	From first to last, the onset and retire	999
	Of both your armies; whose equality	999
	By our best eyes cannot be censured:	999
	Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;	999
	Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power:	999
	Both are alike; and both alike we like.	999
	One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,	999
	We hold our town for neither, yet for both.	999
	999
	[Re-enter KING JOHN and KING PHILIP, with their	999
	powers, severally]	999
	999
KING JOHN	France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?	999
	Say, shall the current of our right run on?	999
	Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,	999
	Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell	999
	With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,	999
	Unless thou let his silver water keep	999
	A peaceful progress to the ocean.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,	999
	In this hot trial, more than we of France;	999
	Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,	999
	That sways the earth this climate overlooks,	999
	Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,	999
	We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,	999
	Or add a royal number to the dead,	999
	Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss	999
	With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.	999
	999
BASTARD	Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,	999
	When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!	999
	O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;	999
	The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;	999
	And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,	999
	In undetermined differences of kings.	999
	Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?	999
	Cry, 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,	999
	You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!	999
	Then let confusion of one part confirm	999
	The other's peace: till then, blows, blood and death!	999
	999
KING JOHN	Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?	999
	999
First Citizen	The king of England; when we know the king.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Know him in us, that here hold up his right.	999
	999
KING JOHN	In us, that are our own great deputy	999
	And bear possession of our person here,	999
	Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.	999
	999
First Citizen	A greater power then we denies all this;	999
	And till it be undoubted, we do lock	999
	Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;	999
	King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved,	999
	Be by some certain king purged and deposed.	999
	999
BASTARD	By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,	999
	And stand securely on their battlements,	999
	As in a theatre, whence they gape and point	999
	At your industrious scenes and acts of death.	999
	Your royal presences be ruled by me:	999
	Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,	999
	Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend	999
	Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:	999
	By east and west let France and England mount	999
	Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,	999
	Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down	999
	The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:	999
	I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,	999
	Even till unfenced desolation	999
	Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.	999
	That done, dissever your united strengths,	999
	And part your mingled colours once again;	999
	Turn face to face and bloody point to point;	999
	Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth	999
	Out of one side her happy minion,	999
	To whom in favour she shall give the day,	999
	And kiss him with a glorious victory.	999
	How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?	999
	Smacks it not something of the policy?	999
	999
KING JOHN	Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,	999
	I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers	999
	And lay this Angiers even to the ground;	999
	Then after fight who shall be king of it?	999
	999
BASTARD	An if thou hast the mettle of a king,	999
	Being wronged as we are by this peevish town,	999
	Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,	999
	As we will ours, against these saucy walls;	999
	And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,	999
	Why then defy each other and pell-mell	999
	Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?	999
	999
KING JOHN	We from the west will send destruction	999
	Into this city's bosom.	999
	999
AUSTRIA	I from the north.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	                  Our thunder from the south	999
	Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.	999
	999
BASTARD	O prudent discipline! From north to south:	999
	Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:	999
	I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!	999
	999
First Citizen	Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,	999
	And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;	999
	Win you this city without stroke or wound;	999
	Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,	999
	That here come sacrifices for the field:	999
	Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.	999
	999
First Citizen	That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,	999
	Is niece to England: look upon the years	999
	Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:	999
	If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,	999
	Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?	999
	If zealous love should go in search of virtue,	999
	Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?	999
	If love ambitious sought a match of birth,	999
	Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?	999
	Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,	999
	Is the young Dauphin every way complete:	999
	If not complete of, say he is not she;	999
	And she again wants nothing, to name want,	999
	If want it be not that she is not he:	999
	He is the half part of a blessed man,	999
	Left to be finished by such as she;	999
	And she a fair divided excellence,	999
	Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.	999
	O, two such silver currents, when they join,	999
	Do glorify the banks that bound them in;	999
	And two such shores to two such streams made one,	999
	Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,	999
	To these two princes, if you marry them.	999
	This union shall do more than battery can	999
	To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,	999
	With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,	999
	The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,	999
	And give you entrance: but without this match,	999
	The sea enraged is not half so deaf,	999
	Lions more confident, mountains and rocks	999
	More free from motion, no, not Death himself	999
	In moral fury half so peremptory,	999
	As we to keep this city.	999
	999
BASTARD	Here's a stay	999
	That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death	999
	Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,	999
	That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,	999
	Talks as familiarly of roaring lions	999
	As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!	999
	What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?	999
	He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;	999
	He gives the bastinado with his tongue:	999
	Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his	999
	But buffets better than a fist of France:	999
	Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words	999
	Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;	999
	Give with our niece a dowry large enough:	999
	For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie	999
	Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,	999
	That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe	999
	The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.	999
	I see a yielding in the looks of France;	999
	Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls	999
	Are capable of this ambition,	999
	Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath	999
	Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,	999
	Cool and congeal again to what it was.	999
	999
First Citizen	Why answer not the double majesties	999
	This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Speak England first, that hath been forward first	999
	To speak unto this city: what say you?	999
	999
KING JOHN	If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,	999
	Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'	999
	Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:	999
	For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,	999
	And all that we upon this side the sea,	999
	Except this city now by us besieged,	999
	Find liable to our crown and dignity,	999
	Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich	999
	In titles, honours and promotions,	999
	As she in beauty, education, blood,	999
	Holds hand with any princess of the world.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	What say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face.	999
	999
LEWIS	I do, my lord; and in her eye I find	999
	A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,	999
	The shadow of myself form'd in her eye:	999
	Which being but the shadow of your son,	999
	Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:	999
	I do protest I never loved myself	999
	Till now infixed I beheld myself	999
	Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.	999
	999
	[Whispers with BLANCH]	999
	999
BASTARD	Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!	999
	Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!	999
	And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy	999
	Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,	999
	That hang'd and drawn and quartered, there should be	999
	In such a love so vile a lout as he.	999
	999
BLANCH	My uncle's will in this respect is mine:	999
	If he see aught in you that makes him like,	999
	That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,	999
	I can with ease translate it to my will;	999
	Or if you will, to speak more properly,	999
	I will enforce it easily to my love.	999
	Further I will not flatter you, my lord,	999
	That all I see in you is worthy love,	999
	Than this; that nothing do I see in you,	999
	Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,	999
	That I can find should merit any hate.	999
	999
KING JOHN	What say these young ones? What say you my niece?	999
	999
BLANCH	That she is bound in honour still to do	999
	What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Speak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?	999
	999
LEWIS	Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;	999
	For I do love her most unfeignedly.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,	999
	Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,	999
	With her to thee; and this addition more,	999
	Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.	999
	Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,	999
	Command thy son and daughter to join hands.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.	999
	999
AUSTRIA	And your lips too; for I am well assured	999
	That I did so when I was first assured.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,	999
	Let in that amity which you have made;	999
	For at Saint Mary's chapel presently	999
	The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.	999
	Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?	999
	I know she is not, for this match made up	999
	Her presence would have interrupted much:	999
	Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.	999
	999
LEWIS	She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	And, by my faith, this league that we have made	999
	Will give her sadness very little cure.	999
	Brother of England, how may we content	999
	This widow lady? In her right we came;	999
	Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,	999
	To our own vantage.	999
	999
KING JOHN	We will heal up all;	999
	For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne	999
	And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town	999
	We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;	999
	Some speedy messenger bid her repair	999
	To our solemnity: I trust we shall,	999
	If not fill up the measure of her will,	999
	Yet in some measure satisfy her so	999
	That we shall stop her exclamation.	999
	Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,	999
	To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but the BASTARD]	999
	999
BASTARD	Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!	999
	John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,	999
	Hath willingly departed with a part,	999
	And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,	999
	Whom zeal and charity brought to the field	999
	As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear	999
	With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,	999
	That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,	999
	That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,	999
	Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,	999
	Who, having no external thing to lose	999
	But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,	999
	That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,	999
	Commodity, the bias of the world,	999
	The world, who of itself is peised well,	999
	Made to run even upon even ground,	999
	Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,	999
	This sway of motion, this Commodity,	999
	Makes it take head from all indifferency,	999
	From all direction, purpose, course, intent:	999
	And this same bias, this Commodity,	999
	This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,	999
	Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,	999
	Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,	999
	From a resolved and honourable war,	999
	To a most base and vile-concluded peace.	999
	And why rail I on this Commodity?	999
	But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:	999
	Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,	999
	When his fair angels would salute my palm;	999
	But for my hand, as unattempted yet,	999
	Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.	999
	Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail	999
	And say there is no sin but to be rich;	999
	And being rich, my virtue then shall be	999
	To say there is no vice but beggary.	999
	Since kings break faith upon commodity,	999
	Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.	999

ACT III	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	The French King's pavilion.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CONSTANCE, ARTHUR, and SALISBURY]	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!	999
	False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!	999
	Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?	999
	It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard:	999
	Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:	999
	It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so:	999
	I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word	999
	Is but the vain breath of a common man:	999
	Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;	999
	I have a king's oath to the contrary.	999
	Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,	999
	For I am sick and capable of fears,	999
	Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,	999
	A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,	999
	A woman, naturally born to fears;	999
	And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,	999
	With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,	999
	But they will quake and tremble all this day.	999
	What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?	999
	Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?	999
	What means that hand upon that breast of thine?	999
	Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,	999
	Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?	999
	Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?	999
	Then speak again; not all thy former tale,	999
	But this one word, whether thy tale be true.	999
	999
SALISBURY	As true as I believe you think them false	999
	That give you cause to prove my saying true.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,	999
	Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,	999
	And let belief and life encounter so	999
	As doth the fury of two desperate men	999
	Which in the very meeting fall and die.	999
	Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?	999
	France friend with England, what becomes of me?	999
	Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:	999
	This news hath made thee a most ugly man.	999
	999
SALISBURY	What other harm have I, good lady, done,	999
	But spoke the harm that is by others done?	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Which harm within itself so heinous is	999
	As it makes harmful all that speak of it.	999
	999
ARTHUR	I do beseech you, madam, be content.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,	999
	Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,	999
	Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,	999
	Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,	999
	Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,	999
	I would not care, I then would be content,	999
	For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou	999
	Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.	999
	But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,	999
	Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:	999
	Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,	999
	And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,	999
	She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;	999
	She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,	999
	And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France	999
	To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,	999
	And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.	999
	France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,	999
	That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!	999
	Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?	999
	Envenom him with words, or get thee gone	999
	And leave those woes alone which I alone	999
	Am bound to under-bear.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Pardon me, madam,	999
	I may not go without you to the kings.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee:	999
	I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;	999
	For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.	999
	To me and to the state of my great grief	999
	Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great	999
	That no supporter but the huge firm earth	999
	Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;	999
	Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.	999
	999
	[Seats herself on the ground]	999
	999
	[Enter KING JOHN, KING PHILLIP, LEWIS, BLANCH,	999
	QUEEN ELINOR, the BASTARD, AUSTRIA, and Attendants]	999
	999
KING PHILIP	'Tis true, fair daughter; and this blessed day	999
	Ever in France shall be kept festival:	999
	To solemnize this day the glorious sun	999
	Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,	999
	Turning with splendor of his precious eye	999
	The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:	999
	The yearly course that brings this day about	999
	Shall never see it but a holiday.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	A wicked day, and not a holy day!	999
	999
	[Rising]	999
	999
	What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,	999
	That it in golden letters should be set	999
	Among the high tides in the calendar?	999
	Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,	999
	This day of shame, oppression, perjury.	999
	Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child	999
	Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,	999
	Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:	999
	But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;	999
	No bargains break that are not this day made:	999
	This day, all things begun come to ill end,	999
	Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!	999
	999
KING PHILIP	By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause	999
	To curse the fair proceedings of this day:	999
	Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?	999
	999
CONSTANCE	You have beguiled me with a counterfeit	999
	Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,	999
	Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;	999
	You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,	999
	But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:	999
	The grappling vigour and rough frown of war	999
	Is cold in amity and painted peace,	999
	And our oppression hath made up this league.	999
	Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!	999
	A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!	999
	Let not the hours of this ungodly day	999
	Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,	999
	Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings!	999
	Hear me, O, hear me!	999
	999
AUSTRIA	Lady Constance, peace!	999
	999
CONSTANCE	War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war	999
	O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame	999
	That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!	999
	Thou little valiant, great in villany!	999
	Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!	999
	Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight	999
	But when her humorous ladyship is by	999
	To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,	999
	And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,	999
	A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear	999
	Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,	999
	Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,	999
	Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend	999
	Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,	999
	And dost thou now fall over to my fores?	999
	Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,	999
	And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.	999
	999
AUSTRIA	O, that a man should speak those words to me!	999
	999
BASTARD	And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.	999
	999
AUSTRIA	Thou darest not say so, villain, for thy life.	999
	999
BASTARD	And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.	999
	999
KING JOHN	We like not this; thou dost forget thyself.	999
	999
	[Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH]	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Here comes the holy legate of the pope.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!	999
	To thee, King John, my holy errand is.	999
	I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,	999
	And from Pope Innocent the legate here,	999
	Do in his name religiously demand	999
	Why thou against the church, our holy mother,	999
	So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce	999
	Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop	999
	Of Canterbury, from that holy see?	999
	This, in our foresaid holy father's name,	999
	Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.	999
	999
KING JOHN	What earthy name to interrogatories	999
	Can task the free breath of a sacred king?	999
	Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name	999
	So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,	999
	To charge me to an answer, as the pope.	999
	Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England	999
	Add thus much more, that no Italian priest	999
	Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;	999
	But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,	999
	So under Him that great supremacy,	999
	Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,	999
	Without the assistance of a mortal hand:	999
	So tell the pope, all reverence set apart	999
	To him and his usurp'd authority.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Though you and all the kings of Christendom	999
	Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,	999
	Dreading the curse that money may buy out;	999
	And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,	999
	Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,	999
	Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,	999
	Though you and all the rest so grossly led	999
	This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,	999
	Yet I alone, alone do me oppose	999
	Against the pope and count his friends my foes.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	Then, by the lawful power that I have,	999
	Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate.	999
	And blessed shall he be that doth revolt	999
	From his allegiance to an heretic;	999
	And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,	999
	Canonized and worshipped as a saint,	999
	That takes away by any secret course	999
	Thy hateful life.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	                  O, lawful let it be	999
	That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!	999
	Good father cardinal, cry thou amen	999
	To my keen curses; for without my wrong	999
	There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	And for mine too: when law can do no right,	999
	Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:	999
	Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,	999
	For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;	999
	Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,	999
	How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	Philip of France, on peril of a curse,	999
	Let go the hand of that arch-heretic;	999
	And raise the power of France upon his head,	999
	Unless he do submit himself to Rome.	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Look to that, devil; lest that France repent,	999
	And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.	999
	999
AUSTRIA	King Philip, listen to the cardinal.	999
	999
BASTARD	And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.	999
	999
AUSTRIA	Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs, Because--	999
	999
BASTARD	        Your breeches best may carry them.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?	999
	999
CONSTANCE	What should he say, but as the cardinal?	999
	999
LEWIS	Bethink you, father; for the difference	999
	Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,	999
	Or the light loss of England for a friend:	999
	Forego the easier.	999
	999
BLANCH	                  That's the curse of Rome.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here	999
	In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.	999
	999
BLANCH	The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,	999
	But from her need.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	                  O, if thou grant my need,	999
	Which only lives but by the death of faith,	999
	That need must needs infer this principle,	999
	That faith would live again by death of need.	999
	O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;	999
	Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!	999
	999
KING JOHN	The king is moved, and answers not to this.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	O, be removed from him, and answer well!	999
	999
AUSTRIA	Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.	999
	999
BASTARD	Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	I am perplex'd, and know not what to say.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,	999
	If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Good reverend father, make my person yours,	999
	And tell me how you would bestow yourself.	999
	This royal hand and mine are newly knit,	999
	And the conjunction of our inward souls	999
	Married in league, coupled and linked together	999
	With all religious strength of sacred vows;	999
	The latest breath that gave the sound of words	999
	Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love	999
	Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,	999
	And even before this truce, but new before,	999
	No longer than we well could wash our hands	999
	To clap this royal bargain up of peace,	999
	Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and over-stain'd	999
	With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint	999
	The fearful difference of incensed kings:	999
	And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,	999
	So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,	999
	Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?	999
	Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,	999
	Make such unconstant children of ourselves,	999
	As now again to snatch our palm from palm,	999
	Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed	999
	Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,	999
	And make a riot on the gentle brow	999
	Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,	999
	My reverend father, let it not be so!	999
	Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose	999
	Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest	999
	To do your pleasure and continue friends.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	All form is formless, order orderless,	999
	Save what is opposite to England's love.	999
	Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,	999
	Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,	999
	A mother's curse, on her revolting son.	999
	France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,	999
	A chafed lion by the mortal paw,	999
	A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,	999
	Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;	999
	And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,	999
	Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow	999
	First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,	999
	That is, to be the champion of our church!	999
	What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself	999
	And may not be performed by thyself,	999
	For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss	999
	Is not amiss when it is truly done,	999
	And being not done, where doing tends to ill,	999
	The truth is then most done not doing it:	999
	The better act of purposes mistook	999
	Is to mistake again; though indirect,	999
	Yet indirection thereby grows direct,	999
	And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire	999
	Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.	999
	It is religion that doth make vows kept;	999
	But thou hast sworn against religion,	999
	By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,	999
	And makest an oath the surety for thy truth	999
	Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure	999
	To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;	999
	Else what a mockery should it be to swear!	999
	But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;	999
	And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.	999
	Therefore thy later vows against thy first	999
	Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;	999
	And better conquest never canst thou make	999
	Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts	999
	Against these giddy loose suggestions:	999
	Upon which better part our prayers come in,	999
	If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know	999
	The peril of our curses light on thee	999
	So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,	999
	But in despair die under their black weight.	999
	999
AUSTRIA	Rebellion, flat rebellion!	999
	999
BASTARD	Will't not be?	999
	Will not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thine?	999
	999
LEWIS	Father, to arms!	999
	999
BLANCH	                  Upon thy wedding-day?	999
	Against the blood that thou hast married?	999
	What, shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men?	999
	Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,	999
	Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?	999
	O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new	999
	Is husband in my mouth! even for that name,	999
	Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,	999
	Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms	999
	Against mine uncle.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	O, upon my knee,	999
	Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,	999
	Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom	999
	Forethought by heaven!	999
	999
BLANCH	Now shall I see thy love: what motive may	999
	Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?	999
	999
CONSTANCE	That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,	999
	His honour: O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!	999
	999
LEWIS	I muse your majesty doth seem so cold,	999
	When such profound respects do pull you on.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	I will denounce a curse upon his head.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	O fair return of banish'd majesty!	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	O foul revolt of French inconstancy!	999
	999
KING JOHN	France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.	999
	999
BASTARD	Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,	999
	Is it as he will? well then, France shall rue.	999
	999
BLANCH	The sun's o'ercast with blood: fair day, adieu!	999
	Which is the side that I must go withal?	999
	I am with both: each army hath a hand;	999
	And in their rage, I having hold of both,	999
	They swirl asunder and dismember me.	999
	Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;	999
	Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;	999
	Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;	999
	Grandam, I will not wish thy fortunes thrive:	999
	Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose	999
	Assured loss before the match be play'd.	999
	999
LEWIS	Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.	999
	999
BLANCH	There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Cousin, go draw our puissance together.	999
	999
	[Exit BASTARD]	999
	999
	France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath;	999
	A rage whose heat hath this condition,	999
	That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,	999
	The blood, and dearest-valued blood, of France.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Thy rage sham burn thee up, and thou shalt turn	999
	To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire:	999
	Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.	999
	999
KING JOHN	No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie!	999

	999
BASTARD	Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;	999

	999
BASTARD	                  My lord, I rescued her;	999

	[To ARTHUR]	999

	999
ARTHUR	O, this will make my mother die with grief!	999
	999
KING JOHN	[To the BASTARD]  Cousin, away for England!	999
	haste before:	999
	And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags	999
	Of hoarding abbots; imprisoned angels	999
	Set at liberty: the fat ribs of peace	999
	Must by the hungry now be fed upon:	999
	Use our commission in his utmost force.	999
	999
BASTARD	Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back,	999
	When gold and silver becks me to come on.	999
	I leave your highness. Grandam, I will pray,	999
	If ever I remember to be holy,	999
	For your fair safety; so, I kiss your hand.	999
	999
ELINOR	Farewell, gentle cousin.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Coz, farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit the BASTARD]	999
	999
QUEEN ELINOR	Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,	999
	We owe thee much! within this wall of flesh	999
	There is a soul counts thee her creditor	999
	And with advantage means to pay thy love:	999
	And my good friend, thy voluntary oath	999
	Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.	999
	Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,	999
	But I will fit it with some better time.	999
	By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamed	999
	To say what good respect I have of thee.	999
	999
HUBERT	I am much bounden to your majesty.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,	999
	But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,	999
	Yet it shall come from me to do thee good.	999
	I had a thing to say, but let it go:	999
	The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,	999
	Attended with the pleasures of the world,	999
	Is all too wanton and too full of gawds	999
	To give me audience: if the midnight bell	999
	Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,	999
	Sound on into the drowsy race of night;	999
	If this same were a churchyard where we stand,	999
	And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,	999
	Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,	999
	Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,	999
	Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,	999
	Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes	999
	And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,	999
	A passion hateful to my purposes,	999
	Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,	999
	Hear me without thine ears, and make reply	999
	Without a tongue, using conceit alone,	999
	Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;	999
	Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,	999
	I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:	999
	But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well;	999
	And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well.	999
	999
HUBERT	So well, that what you bid me undertake,	999
	Though that my death were adjunct to my act,	999
	By heaven, I would do it.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Do not I know thou wouldst?	999
	Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye	999
	On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,	999
	He is a very serpent in my way;	999
	And whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread,	999
	He lies before me: dost thou understand me?	999
	Thou art his keeper.	999
	999
HUBERT	And I'll keep him so,	999
	That he shall not offend your majesty.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Death.	999
	999
HUBERT	My lord?	999
	999
KING JOHN	       A grave.	999
	999
HUBERT	                  He shall not live.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Enough.	999
	I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee;	999
	Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee:	999
	Remember. Madam, fare you well:	999
	I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty.	999
	999
ELINOR	My blessing go with thee!	999
	999
KING JOHN	For England, cousin, go:	999

	999
	999
	[Enter KING PHILIP, LEWIS, CARDINAL PANDULPH,	999
	and Attendants]	999
	999
KING PHILIP	So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,	999
	A whole armado of convicted sail	999
	Is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	Courage and comfort! all shall yet go well.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	What can go well, when we have run so ill?	999
	Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?	999
	Arthur ta'en prisoner? divers dear friends slain?	999
	And bloody England into England gone,	999
	O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?	999
	999
LEWIS	What he hath won, that hath he fortified:	999
	So hot a speed with such advice disposed,	999
	Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,	999
	Doth want example: who hath read or heard	999
	Of any kindred action like to this?	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Well could I bear that England had this praise,	999
	So we could find some pattern of our shame.	999
	999
	[Enter CONSTANCE]	999
	999
	Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;	999
	Holding the eternal spirit against her will,	999
	In the vile prison of afflicted breath.	999
	I prithee, lady, go away with me.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Lo, now I now see the issue of your peace.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Patience, good lady! comfort, gentle Constance!	999
	999
CONSTANCE	No, I defy all counsel, all redress,	999
	But that which ends all counsel, true redress,	999
	Death, death; O amiable lovely death!	999
	Thou odouriferous stench! sound rottenness!	999
	Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,	999
	Thou hate and terror to prosperity,	999
	And I will kiss thy detestable bones	999
	And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows	999
	And ring these fingers with thy household worms	999
	And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust	999
	And be a carrion monster like thyself:	999
	Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest	999
	And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,	999
	O, come to me!	999
	999
KING PHILIP	                  O fair affliction, peace!	999
	999
CONSTANCE	No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:	999
	O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!	999
	Then with a passion would I shake the world;	999
	And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy	999
	Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,	999
	Which scorns a modern invocation.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Thou art not holy to belie me so;	999
	I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;	999
	My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;	999
	Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:	999
	I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!	999
	For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:	999
	O, if I could, what grief should I forget!	999
	Preach some philosophy to make me mad,	999
	And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;	999
	For being not mad but sensible of grief,	999
	My reasonable part produces reason	999
	How I may be deliver'd of these woes,	999
	And teaches me to kill or hang myself:	999
	If I were mad, I should forget my son,	999
	Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:	999
	I am not mad; too well, too well I feel	999
	The different plague of each calamity.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note	999
	In the fair multitude of those her hairs!	999
	Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,	999
	Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends	999
	Do glue themselves in sociable grief,	999
	Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,	999
	Sticking together in calamity.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	To England, if you will.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	Bind up your hairs.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?	999
	I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud	999
	'O that these hands could so redeem my son,	999
	As they have given these hairs their liberty!'	999
	But now I envy at their liberty,	999
	And will again commit them to their bonds,	999
	Because my poor child is a prisoner.	999
	And, father cardinal, I have heard you say	999
	That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:	999
	If that be true, I shall see my boy again;	999
	For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,	999
	To him that did but yesterday suspire,	999
	There was not such a gracious creature born.	999
	But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud	999
	And chase the native beauty from his cheek	999
	And he will look as hollow as a ghost,	999
	As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,	999
	And so he'll die; and, rising so again,	999
	When I shall meet him in the court of heaven	999
	I shall not know him: therefore never, never	999
	Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	You hold too heinous a respect of grief.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	He talks to me that never had a son.	999
	999
KING PHILIP	You are as fond of grief as of your child.	999
	999
CONSTANCE	Grief fills the room up of my absent child,	999
	Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,	999
	Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,	999
	Remembers me of all his gracious parts,	999
	Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;	999
	Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?	999
	Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,	999
	I could give better comfort than you do.	999
	I will not keep this form upon my head,	999
	When there is such disorder in my wit.	999
	O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!	999
	My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!	999
	My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING PHILIP	I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
LEWIS	There's nothing in this world can make me joy:	999
	Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale	999
	Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;	999
	And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste	999
	That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	Before the curing of a strong disease,	999
	Even in the instant of repair and health,	999
	The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,	999
	On their departure most of all show evil:	999
	What have you lost by losing of this day?	999
	999
LEWIS	All days of glory, joy and happiness.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	If you had won it, certainly you had.	999
	No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,	999
	She looks upon them with a threatening eye.	999
	'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost	999
	In this which he accounts so clearly won:	999
	Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?	999
	999
LEWIS	As heartily as he is glad he hath him.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.	999
	Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;	999
	For even the breath of what I mean to speak	999
	Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,	999
	Out of the path which shall directly lead	999
	Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.	999
	John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be	999
	That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,	999
	The misplaced John should entertain an hour,	999
	One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.	999
	A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand	999
	Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;	999
	And he that stands upon a slippery place	999
	Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:	999
	That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;	999
	So be it, for it cannot be but so.	999
	999
LEWIS	But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,	999
	May then make all the claim that Arthur did.	999
	999
LEWIS	And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	How green you are and fresh in this old world!	999
	John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;	999
	For he that steeps his safety in true blood	999
	Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.	999
	This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts	999
	Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,	999
	That none so small advantage shall step forth	999
	To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;	999
	No natural exhalation in the sky,	999
	No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,	999
	No common wind, no customed event,	999
	But they will pluck away his natural cause	999
	And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,	999
	Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,	999
	Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.	999
	999
LEWIS	May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,	999
	But hold himself safe in his prisonment.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,	999
	If that young Arthur be not gone already,	999
	Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts	999
	Of all his people shall revolt from him	999
	And kiss the lips of unacquainted change	999
	And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath	999
	Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.	999
	Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:	999
	And, O, what better matter breeds for you	999
	Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge	999
	Is now in England, ransacking the church,	999
	Offending charity: if but a dozen French	999
	Were there in arms, they would be as a call	999
	To train ten thousand English to their side,	999
	Or as a little snow, tumbled about,	999
	Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,	999
	Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful	999
	What may be wrought out of their discontent,	999
	Now that their souls are topful of offence.	999
	For England go: I will whet on the king.	999
	999
LEWIS	Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:	999
	If you say ay, the king will not say no.	999

SCENE I	A room in a castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter HUBERT and Executioners]	999
	999
HUBERT	Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand	999
	Within the arras: when I strike my foot	999
	Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,	999
	And bind the boy which you shall find with me	999
	Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.	999
	999
First Executioner	I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.	999
	999
HUBERT	Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Executioners]	999
	999
	Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.	999
	999
	[Enter ARTHUR]	999
	999
ARTHUR	Good morrow, Hubert.	999
	999
HUBERT	Good morrow, little prince.	999
	999
ARTHUR	As little prince, having so great a title	999
	To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.	999
	999
HUBERT	Indeed, I have been merrier.	999
	999
ARTHUR	Mercy on me!	999
	Methinks no body should be sad but I:	999
	Yet, I remember, when I was in France,	999
	Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,	999
	Only for wantonness. By my christendom,	999
	So I were out of prison and kept sheep,	999
	I should be as merry as the day is long;	999
	And so I would be here, but that I doubt	999
	My uncle practises more harm to me:	999
	He is afraid of me and I of him:	999
	Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?	999
	No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven	999
	I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.	999
	999
HUBERT	[Aside]  If I talk to him, with his innocent prate	999
	He will awake my mercy which lies dead:	999
	Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.	999
	999
ARTHUR	Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:	999
	In sooth, I would you were a little sick,	999
	That I might sit all night and watch with you:	999
	I warrant I love you more than you do me.	999
	999
HUBERT	[Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.	999
	Read here, young Arthur.	999
	999
	[Showing a paper]	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
		   How now, foolish rheum!	999
	Turning dispiteous torture out of door!	999
	I must be brief, lest resolution drop	999
	Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.	999
	Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?	999
	999
ARTHUR	Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:	999
	Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?	999
	999
HUBERT	Young boy, I must.	999
	999
ARTHUR	                  And will you?	999
	999
HUBERT	And I will.	999
	999
ARTHUR	Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,	999
	I knit my handercher about your brows,	999
	The best I had, a princess wrought it me,	999
	And I did never ask it you again;	999
	And with my hand at midnight held your head,	999
	And like the watchful minutes to the hour,	999
	Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,	999
	Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'	999
	Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'	999
	Many a poor man's son would have lien still	999
	And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;	999
	But you at your sick service had a prince.	999
	Nay, you may think my love was crafty love	999
	And call it cunning: do, an if you will:	999
	If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,	999
	Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?	999
	These eyes that never did nor never shall	999
	So much as frown on you.	999
	999
HUBERT	I have sworn to do it;	999
	And with hot irons must I burn them out.	999
	999
ARTHUR	Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!	999
	The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,	999
	Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears	999
	And quench his fiery indignation	999
	Even in the matter of mine innocence;	999
	Nay, after that, consume away in rust	999
	But for containing fire to harm mine eye.	999
	Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?	999
	An if an angel should have come to me	999
	And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,	999
	I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's.	999
	999
HUBERT	Come forth.	999
	999
	[Stamps]	999
	999
	[Re-enter Executioners, with a cord, irons, &c]	999
	999
	Do as I bid you do.	999
	999
ARTHUR	O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out	999
	Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.	999
	999
HUBERT	Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.	999
	999
ARTHUR	Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?	999
	I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.	999
	For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!	999
	Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,	999
	And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;	999
	I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,	999
	Nor look upon the iron angerly:	999
	Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,	999
	Whatever torment you do put me to.	999
	999
HUBERT	Go, stand within; let me alone with him.	999
	999
First Executioner	I am best pleased to be from such a deed.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Executioners]	999
	999
ARTHUR	Alas, I then have chid away my friend!	999
	He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:	999
	Let him come back, that his compassion may	999
	Give life to yours.	999
	999
HUBERT	Come, boy, prepare yourself.	999
	999
ARTHUR	Is there no remedy?	999
	999
HUBERT	None, but to lose your eyes.	999
	999
ARTHUR	O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,	999
	A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,	999
	Any annoyance in that precious sense!	999
	Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,	999
	Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.	999
	999
HUBERT	Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.	999
	999
ARTHUR	Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues	999
	Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:	999
	Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;	999
	Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,	999
	So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.	999
	Though to no use but still to look on you!	999
	Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold	999
	And would not harm me.	999
	999
HUBERT	I can heat it, boy.	999
	999
ARTHUR	No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,	999
	Being create for comfort, to be used	999
	In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;	999
	There is no malice in this burning coal;	999
	The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out	999
	And strew'd repentent ashes on his head.	999
	999
HUBERT	But with my breath I can revive it, boy.	999
	999
ARTHUR	An if you do, you will but make it blush	999
	And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:	999
	Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;	999
	And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,	999
	Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.	999
	All things that you should use to do me wrong	999
	Deny their office: only you do lack	999
	That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,	999
	Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.	999
	999
HUBERT	Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye	999
	For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:	999
	Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,	999
	With this same very iron to burn them out.	999
	999
ARTHUR	O, now you look like Hubert! all this while	999
	You were disguised.	999
	999
HUBERT	Peace; no more. Adieu.	999
	Your uncle must not know but you are dead;	999
	I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:	999
	And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,	999
	That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,	999
	Will not offend thee.	999
	999
ARTHUR	O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.	999
	999
HUBERT	Silence; no more: go closely in with me:	999
	Much danger do I undergo for thee.	999
	999

	KING JOHN	999
	999
	999
ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	KING JOHN'S palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and other Lords]	999
	999
KING JOHN	Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,	999
	And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,	999
	Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,	999
	And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,	999
	The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;	999
	Fresh expectation troubled not the land	999
	With any long'd-for change or better state.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,	999
	To guard a title that was rich before,	999
	To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,	999
	To throw a perfume on the violet,	999
	To smooth the ice, or add another hue	999
	Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light	999
	To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,	999
	Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	But that your royal pleasure must be done,	999
	This act is as an ancient tale new told,	999
	And in the last repeating troublesome,	999
	Being urged at a time unseasonable.	999
	999
SALISBURY	In this the antique and well noted face	999
	Of plain old form is much disfigured;	999
	And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,	999
	It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,	999
	Startles and frights consideration,	999
	Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,	999
	For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	When workmen strive to do better than well,	999
	They do confound their skill in covetousness;	999
	And oftentimes excusing of a fault	999
	Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,	999
	As patches set upon a little breach	999
	Discredit more in hiding of the fault	999
	Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.	999
	999
SALISBURY	To this effect, before you were new crown'd,	999
	We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness	999
	To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,	999
	Since all and every part of what we would	999
	Doth make a stand at what your highness will.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Some reasons of this double coronation	999
	I have possess'd you with and think them strong;	999
	And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,	999
	I shall indue you with: meantime but ask	999
	What you would have reform'd that is not well,	999
	And well shall you perceive how willingly	999
	I will both hear and grant you your requests.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,	999
	To sound the purpose of all their hearts,	999
	Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,	999
	Your safety, for the which myself and them	999
	Bend their best studies, heartily request	999
	The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint	999
	Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent	999
	To break into this dangerous argument,--	999
	If what in rest you have in right you hold,	999
	Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend	999
	The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up	999
	Your tender kinsman and to choke his days	999
	With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth	999
	The rich advantage of good exercise?	999
	That the time's enemies may not have this	999
	To grace occasions, let it be our suit	999
	That you have bid us ask his liberty;	999
	Which for our goods we do no further ask	999
	Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,	999
	Counts it your weal he have his liberty.	999
	999
	[Enter HUBERT]	999
	999
KING JOHN	Let it be so: I do commit his youth	999
	To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?	999
	999
	[Taking him apart]	999
	999
PEMBROKE	This is the man should do the bloody deed;	999
	He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:	999
	The image of a wicked heinous fault	999
	Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his	999
	Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;	999
	And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,	999
	What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.	999
	999
SALISBURY	The colour of the king doth come and go	999
	Between his purpose and his conscience,	999
	Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:	999
	His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence	999
	The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.	999
	999
KING JOHN	We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:	999
	Good lords, although my will to give is living,	999
	The suit which you demand is gone and dead:	999
	He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	Indeed we heard how near his death he was	999
	Before the child himself felt he was sick:	999
	This must be answer'd either here or hence.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?	999
	Think you I bear the shears of destiny?	999
	Have I commandment on the pulse of life?	999
	999
SALISBURY	It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame	999
	That greatness should so grossly offer it:	999
	So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,	999
	And find the inheritance of this poor child,	999
	His little kingdom of a forced grave.	999
	That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,	999
	Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!	999
	This must not be thus borne: this will break out	999
	To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Lords]	999
	999
KING JOHN	They burn in indignation. I repent:	999
	There is no sure foundation set on blood,	999
	No certain life achieved by others' death.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
	A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood	999
	That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?	999
	So foul a sky clears not without a storm:	999
	Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?	999
	999
Messenger	From France to England. Never such a power	999
	For any foreign preparation	999
	Was levied in the body of a land.	999
	The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;	999
	For when you should be told they do prepare,	999
	The tidings come that they are all arrived.	999
	999
KING JOHN	O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?	999
	Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,	999
	That such an army could be drawn in France,	999
	And she not hear of it?	999
	999
Messenger	My liege, her ear	999
	Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died	999
	Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,	999
	The Lady Constance in a frenzy died	999
	Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue	999
	I idly heard; if true or false I know not.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!	999
	O, make a league with me, till I have pleased	999
	My discontented peers! What! mother dead!	999
	How wildly then walks my estate in France!	999
	Under whose conduct came those powers of France	999
	That thou for truth givest out are landed here?	999
	999
Messenger	Under the Dauphin.	999
	999
KING JOHN	                  Thou hast made me giddy	999
	With these ill tidings.	999
	999
	[Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret]	999
	999
		  Now, what says the world	999
	To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff	999
	My head with more ill news, for it is full.	999
	999
BASTARD	But if you be afeard to hear the worst,	999
	Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed	999
	Under the tide: but now I breathe again	999
	Aloft the flood, and can give audience	999
	To any tongue, speak it of what it will.	999
	999
BASTARD	How I have sped among the clergymen,	999
	The sums I have collected shall express.	999
	But as I travell'd hither through the land,	999
	I find the people strangely fantasied;	999
	Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,	999
	Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:	999
	And here a prophet, that I brought with me	999
	From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found	999
	With many hundreds treading on his heels;	999
	To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,	999
	That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,	999
	Your highness should deliver up your crown.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?	999
	999
PETER	Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Hubert, away with him; imprison him;	999
	And on that day at noon whereon he says	999
	I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.	999
	Deliver him to safety; and return,	999
	For I must use thee.	999
	999
	[Exeunt HUBERT with PETER]	999
	999
		O my gentle cousin,	999
	Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?	999
	999
BASTARD	The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:	999
	Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,	999
	With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,	999
	And others more, going to seek the grave	999
	Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night	999
	On your suggestion.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Gentle kinsman, go,	999
	And thrust thyself into their companies:	999
	I have a way to win their loves again;	999
	Bring them before me.	999
	999
BASTARD	I will seek them out.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.	999
	O, let me have no subject enemies,	999
	When adverse foreigners affright my towns	999
	With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!	999
	Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,	999
	And fly like thought from them to me again.	999
	999
BASTARD	The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING JOHN	Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.	999
	Go after him; for he perhaps shall need	999
	Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;	999
	And be thou he.	999
	999
Messenger	                  With all my heart, my liege.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING JOHN	My mother dead!	999
	999
	[Re-enter HUBERT]	999
	999
HUBERT	My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;	999
	Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about	999
	The other four in wondrous motion.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Five moons!	999
	999
HUBERT	Old men and beldams in the streets	999
	Do prophesy upon it dangerously:	999
	Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:	999
	And when they talk of him, they shake their heads	999
	And whisper one another in the ear;	999
	And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,	999
	Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,	999
	With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.	999
	I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,	999
	The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,	999
	With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;	999
	Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,	999
	Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste	999
	Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,	999
	Told of a many thousand warlike French	999
	That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:	999
	Another lean unwash'd artificer	999
	Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?	999
	Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?	999
	Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause	999
	To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.	999
	999
HUBERT	No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?	999
	999
KING JOHN	It is the curse of kings to be attended	999
	By slaves that take their humours for a warrant	999
	To break within the bloody house of life,	999
	And on the winking of authority	999
	To understand a law, to know the meaning	999
	Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns	999
	More upon humour than advised respect.	999
	999
HUBERT	Here is your hand and seal for what I did.	999
	999
KING JOHN	O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth	999
	Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal	999
	Witness against us to damnation!	999
	How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds	999
	Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,	999
	A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,	999
	Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,	999
	This murder had not come into my mind:	999
	But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,	999
	Finding thee fit for bloody villany,	999
	Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,	999
	I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;	999
	And thou, to be endeared to a king,	999
	Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.	999
	999
HUBERT	My lord--	999
	999
KING JOHN	Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause	999
	When I spake darkly what I purposed,	999
	Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,	999
	As bid me tell my tale in express words,	999
	Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,	999
	And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:	999
	But thou didst understand me by my signs	999
	And didst in signs again parley with sin;	999
	Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,	999
	And consequently thy rude hand to act	999
	The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.	999
	Out of my sight, and never see me more!	999
	My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,	999
	Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:	999
	Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,	999
	This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,	999
	Hostility and civil tumult reigns	999
	Between my conscience and my cousin's death.	999
	999
HUBERT	Arm you against your other enemies,	999
	I'll make a peace between your soul and you.	999
	Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine	999
	Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,	999
	Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.	999
	Within this bosom never enter'd yet	999
	The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;	999
	And you have slander'd nature in my form,	999
	Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,	999
	Is yet the cover of a fairer mind	999
	Than to be butcher of an innocent child.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,	999
	Throw this report on their incensed rage,	999
	And make them tame to their obedience!	999
	Forgive the comment that my passion made	999
	Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,	999
	And foul imaginary eyes of blood	999
	Presented thee more hideous than thou art.	999
	O, answer not, but to my closet bring	999
	The angry lords with all expedient haste.	999
	I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.	999

SCENE III	Before the castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter ARTHUR, on the walls]	999
	999
ARTHUR	The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:	999
	Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!	999
	There's few or none do know me: if they did,	999
	This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.	999
	I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.	999
	If I get down, and do not break my limbs,	999
	I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:	999
	As good to die and go, as die and stay.	999
	999
	[Leaps down]	999
	999
	O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:	999
	Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
	[Enter PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and BIGOT]	999
	999
SALISBURY	Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:	999
	It is our safety, and we must embrace	999
	This gentle offer of the perilous time.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	Who brought that letter from the cardinal?	999
	999
SALISBURY	The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,	999
	Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love	999
	Is much more general than these lines import.	999
	999
BIGOT	To-morrow morning let us meet him then.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be	999
	Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.	999
	999
	[Enter the BASTARD]	999
	999
BASTARD	Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!	999
	The king by me requests your presence straight.	999
	999
SALISBURY	The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:	999
	We will not line his thin bestained cloak	999
	With our pure honours, nor attend the foot	999
	That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.	999
	Return and tell him so: we know the worst.	999
	999
BASTARD	Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.	999
	999
BASTARD	But there is little reason in your grief;	999
	Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.	999
	999
BASTARD	'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.	999
	999
SALISBURY	This is the prison. What is he lies here?	999
	999
	[Seeing ARTHUR]	999
	999
PEMBROKE	O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!	999
	The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Murder, as hating what himself hath done,	999
	Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.	999
	999
BIGOT	Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,	999
	Found it too precious-princely for a grave.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,	999
	Or have you read or heard? or could you think?	999
	Or do you almost think, although you see,	999
	That you do see? could thought, without this object,	999
	Form such another? This is the very top,	999
	The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,	999
	Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,	999
	The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,	999
	That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage	999
	Presented to the tears of soft remorse.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	All murders past do stand excused in this:	999
	And this, so sole and so unmatchable,	999
	Shall give a holiness, a purity,	999
	To the yet unbegotten sin of times;	999
	And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,	999
	Exampled by this heinous spectacle.	999
	999
BASTARD	It is a damned and a bloody work;	999
	The graceless action of a heavy hand,	999
	If that it be the work of any hand.	999
	999
SALISBURY	If that it be the work of any hand!	999
	We had a kind of light what would ensue:	999
	It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;	999
	The practise and the purpose of the king:	999
	From whose obedience I forbid my soul,	999
	Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,	999
	And breathing to his breathless excellence	999
	The incense of a vow, a holy vow,	999
	Never to taste the pleasures of the world,	999
	Never to be infected with delight,	999
	Nor conversant with ease and idleness,	999
	Till I have set a glory to this hand,	999
	By giving it the worship of revenge.	999
	999
	999
PEMBROKE	|	999

BIGOT	|	999

	999
	[Enter HUBERT]	999
	999
HUBERT	Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:	999
	Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.	999
	999
SALISBURY	O, he is old and blushes not at death.	999
	Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!	999
	999
HUBERT	I am no villain.	999
	999
SALISBURY	                  Must I rob the law?	999
	999
	[Drawing his sword]	999
	999
BASTARD	Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.	999
	999
HUBERT	Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;	999
	By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:	999
	I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,	999
	Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;	999
	Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget	999
	Your worth, your greatness and nobility.	999
	999
BIGOT	Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?	999
	999
HUBERT	Not for my life: but yet I dare defend	999
	My innocent life against an emperor.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Thou art a murderer.	999
	999
HUBERT	Do not prove me so;	999
	Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,	999
	Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	Cut him to pieces.	999
	999
BASTARD	                  Keep the peace, I say.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.	999
	999
BASTARD	Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:	999
	If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,	999
	Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,	999
	I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;	999
	Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,	999
	That you shall think the devil is come from hell.	999
	999
BIGOT	What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?	999
	Second a villain and a murderer?	999
	999
HUBERT	Lord Bigot, I am none.	999
	999
BIGOT	Who kill'd this prince?	999
	999
HUBERT	'Tis not an hour since I left him well:	999
	I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep	999
	My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,	999
	For villany is not without such rheum;	999
	And he, long traded in it, makes it seem	999
	Like rivers of remorse and innocency.	999
	Away with me, all you whose souls abhor	999
	The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;	999
	For I am stifled with this smell of sin.	999
	999
BIGOT	Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!	999
	999
PEMBROKE	There tell the king he may inquire us out.	999
	999
	[Exeunt Lords]	999
	999
BASTARD	Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?	999
	Beyond the infinite and boundless reach	999
	Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,	999
	Art thou damn'd, Hubert.	999
	999
HUBERT	Do but hear me, sir.	999
	999
BASTARD	Ha! I'll tell thee what;	999
	Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;	999
	Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:	999
	There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell	999
	As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.	999
	999
HUBERT	Upon my soul--	999
	999
BASTARD	                  If thou didst but consent	999
	To this most cruel act, do but despair;	999
	And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread	999
	That ever spider twisted from her womb	999
	Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam	999
	To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,	999
	Put but a little water in a spoon,	999
	And it shall be as all the ocean,	999
	Enough to stifle such a villain up.	999
	I do suspect thee very grievously.	999
	999
HUBERT	If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,	999
	Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath	999
	Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,	999
	Let hell want pains enough to torture me.	999
	I left him well.	999
	999
BASTARD	                  Go, bear him in thine arms.	999
	I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way	999
	Among the thorns and dangers of this world.	999
	How easy dost thou take all England up!	999
	From forth this morsel of dead royalty,	999
	The life, the right and truth of all this realm	999
	Is fled to heaven; and England now is left	999
	To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth	999
	The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.	999
	Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty	999
	Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest	999
	And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:	999
	Now powers from home and discontents at home	999
	Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,	999
	As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,	999
	The imminent decay of wrested pomp.	999
	Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can	999
	Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child	999
	And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:	999
	A thousand businesses are brief in hand,	999
	And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter KING JOHN, CARDINAL PANDULPH, and Attendants]	999
	999
KING JOHN	Thus have I yielded up into your hand	999
	The circle of my glory.	999
	999
	[Giving the crown]	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	Take again	999
	From this my hand, as holding of the pope	999
	Your sovereign greatness and authority.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,	999
	And from his holiness use all your power	999
	To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.	999
	Our discontented counties do revolt;	999
	Our people quarrel with obedience,	999
	Swearing allegiance and the love of soul	999
	To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.	999
	This inundation of mistemper'd humour	999
	Rests by you only to be qualified:	999
	Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,	999
	That present medicine must be minister'd,	999
	Or overthrow incurable ensues.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	It was my breath that blew this tempest up,	999
	Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;	999
	But since you are a gentle convertite,	999
	My tongue shall hush again this storm of war	999
	And make fair weather in your blustering land.	999
	On this Ascension-day, remember well,	999
	Upon your oath of service to the pope,	999
	Go I to make the French lay down their arms.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING JOHN	Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet	999
	Say that before Ascension-day at noon	999
	My crown I should give off? Even so I have:	999
	I did suppose it should be on constraint:	999
	But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.	999
	999
	[Enter the BASTARD]	999
	999
BASTARD	All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out	999
	But Dover castle: London hath received,	999
	Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:	999
	Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone	999
	To offer service to your enemy,	999
	And wild amazement hurries up and down	999
	The little number of your doubtful friends.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Would not my lords return to me again,	999
	After they heard young Arthur was alive?	999
	999
BASTARD	They found him dead and cast into the streets,	999
	An empty casket, where the jewel of life	999
	By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.	999
	999
KING JOHN	That villain Hubert told me he did live.	999
	999
BASTARD	So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.	999
	But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?	999
	Be great in act, as you have been in thought;	999
	Let not the world see fear and sad distrust	999
	Govern the motion of a kingly eye:	999
	Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;	999
	Threaten the threatener and outface the brow	999
	Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,	999
	That borrow their behaviors from the great,	999
	Grow great by your example and put on	999
	The dauntless spirit of resolution.	999
	Away, and glister like the god of war,	999
	When he intendeth to become the field:	999
	Show boldness and aspiring confidence.	999
	What, shall they seek the lion in his den,	999
	And fright him there? and make him tremble there?	999
	O, let it not be said: forage, and run	999
	To meet displeasure farther from the doors,	999
	And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.	999
	999
KING JOHN	The legate of the pope hath been with me,	999
	And I have made a happy peace with him;	999
	And he hath promised to dismiss the powers	999
	Led by the Dauphin.	999
	999
BASTARD	O inglorious league!	999
	Shall we, upon the footing of our land,	999
	Send fair-play orders and make compromise,	999
	Insinuation, parley and base truce	999
	To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,	999
	A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,	999
	And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,	999
	Mocking the air with colours idly spread,	999
	And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:	999
	Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;	999
	Or if he do, let it at least be said	999
	They saw we had a purpose of defence.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Have thou the ordering of this present time.	999
	999
BASTARD	Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,	999

	999
	999
	[Enter, in arms, LEWIS, SALISBURY, MELUN, PEMBROKE,	999
	BIGOT, and Soldiers]	999
	999
LEWIS	My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,	999
	And keep it safe for our remembrance:	999
	Return the precedent to these lords again;	999
	That, having our fair order written down,	999
	Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,	999
	May know wherefore we took the sacrament	999
	And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Upon our sides it never shall be broken.	999
	And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear	999
	A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith	999
	To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,	999
	I am not glad that such a sore of time	999
	Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,	999
	And heal the inveterate canker of one wound	999
	By making many. O, it grieves my soul,	999
	That I must draw this metal from my side	999
	To be a widow-maker! O, and there	999
	Where honourable rescue and defence	999
	Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!	999
	But such is the infection of the time,	999
	That, for the health and physic of our right,	999
	We cannot deal but with the very hand	999
	Of stern injustice and confused wrong.	999
	And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,	999
	That we, the sons and children of this isle,	999
	Were born to see so sad an hour as this;	999
	Wherein we step after a stranger march	999
	Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up	999
	Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep	999
	Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--	999
	To grace the gentry of a land remote,	999
	And follow unacquainted colours here?	999
	What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!	999
	That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,	999
	Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,	999
	And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;	999
	Where these two Christian armies might combine	999
	The blood of malice in a vein of league,	999
	And not to spend it so unneighbourly!	999
	999
LEWIS	A noble temper dost thou show in this;	999
	And great affections wrestling in thy bosom	999
	Doth make an earthquake of nobility.	999
	O, what a noble combat hast thou fought	999
	Between compulsion and a brave respect!	999
	Let me wipe off this honourable dew,	999
	That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:	999
	My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,	999
	Being an ordinary inundation;	999
	But this effusion of such manly drops,	999
	This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,	999
	Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed	999
	Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven	999
	Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.	999
	Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,	999
	And with a great heart heave away the storm:	999
	Commend these waters to those baby eyes	999
	That never saw the giant world enraged;	999
	Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,	999
	Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.	999
	Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep	999
	Into the purse of rich prosperity	999
	As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,	999
	That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.	999
	And even there, methinks, an angel spake:	999
	999
	[Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH]	999
	999
	Look, where the holy legate comes apace,	999
	To give us warrant from the hand of heaven	999
	And on our actions set the name of right	999
	With holy breath.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	                  Hail, noble prince of France!	999
	The next is this, King John hath reconciled	999
	Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,	999
	That so stood out against the holy church,	999
	The great metropolis and see of Rome:	999
	Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;	999
	And tame the savage spirit of wild war,	999
	That like a lion foster'd up at hand,	999
	It may lie gently at the foot of peace,	999
	And be no further harmful than in show.	999
	999
LEWIS	Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:	999
	I am too high-born to be propertied,	999
	To be a secondary at control,	999
	Or useful serving-man and instrument,	999
	To any sovereign state throughout the world.	999
	Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars	999
	Between this chastised kingdom and myself,	999
	And brought in matter that should feed this fire;	999
	And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out	999
	With that same weak wind which enkindled it.	999
	You taught me how to know the face of right,	999
	Acquainted me with interest to this land,	999
	Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;	999
	And come ye now to tell me John hath made	999
	His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?	999
	I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,	999
	After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;	999
	And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back	999
	Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?	999
	Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,	999
	What men provided, what munition sent,	999
	To underprop this action? Is't not I	999
	That undergo this charge? who else but I,	999
	And such as to my claim are liable,	999
	Sweat in this business and maintain this war?	999
	Have I not heard these islanders shout out	999
	'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?	999
	Have I not here the best cards for the game,	999
	To win this easy match play'd for a crown?	999
	And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?	999
	No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	You look but on the outside of this work.	999
	999
LEWIS	Outside or inside, I will not return	999
	Till my attempt so much be glorified	999
	As to my ample hope was promised	999
	Before I drew this gallant head of war,	999
	And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,	999
	To outlook conquest and to win renown	999
	Even in the jaws of danger and of death.	999
	999
	[Trumpet sounds]	999
	999
	What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?	999
	999
	[Enter the BASTARD, attended]	999
	999
BASTARD	According to the fair play of the world,	999
	Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:	999
	My holy lord of Milan, from the king	999
	I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;	999
	And, as you answer, I do know the scope	999
	And warrant limited unto my tongue.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,	999
	And will not temporize with my entreaties;	999
	He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.	999
	999
BASTARD	By all the blood that ever fury breathed,	999
	The youth says well. Now hear our English king;	999
	For thus his royalty doth speak in me.	999
	He is prepared, and reason too he should:	999
	This apish and unmannerly approach,	999
	This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,	999
	This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,	999
	The king doth smile at; and is well prepared	999
	To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,	999
	From out the circle of his territories.	999
	That hand which had the strength, even at your door,	999
	To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,	999
	To dive like buckets in concealed wells,	999
	To crouch in litter of your stable planks,	999
	To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,	999
	To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out	999
	In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake	999
	Even at the crying of your nation's crow,	999
	Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;	999
	Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,	999
	That in your chambers gave you chastisement?	999
	No: know the gallant monarch is in arms	999
	And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,	999
	To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.	999
	And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,	999
	You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb	999
	Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;	999
	For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids	999
	Like Amazons come tripping after drums,	999
	Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,	999
	Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts	999
	To fierce and bloody inclination.	999
	999
LEWIS	There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;	999
	We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;	999
	We hold our time too precious to be spent	999
	With such a brabbler.	999
	999
CARDINAL PANDULPH	Give me leave to speak.	999
	999
BASTARD	No, I will speak.	999
	999
LEWIS	                  We will attend to neither.	999
	Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war	999
	Plead for our interest and our being here.	999
	999
BASTARD	Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;	999
	And so shall you, being beaten: do but start	999
	An echo with the clamour of thy drum,	999
	And even at hand a drum is ready braced	999
	That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;	999
	Sound but another, and another shall	999
	As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear	999
	And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,	999
	Not trusting to this halting legate here,	999
	Whom he hath used rather for sport than need	999
	Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits	999
	A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day	999
	To feast upon whole thousands of the French.	999
	999
LEWIS	Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.	999
	999

HUBERT	Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?	999
	999
KING JOHN	This fever, that hath troubled me so long,	999
	Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,	999
	Desires your majesty to leave the field	999
	And send him word by me which way you go.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.	999
	999
Messenger	Be of good comfort; for the great supply	999
	That was expected by the Dauphin here,	999
	Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.	999
	This news was brought to Richard but even now:	999
	The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.	999
	999
KING JOHN	Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,	999
	And will not let me welcome this good news.	999
	Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;	999
	Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.	999

SALISBURY	I did not think the king so stored with friends.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	Up once again; put spirit in the French:	999
	If they miscarry, we miscarry too.	999
	999
SALISBURY	That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,	999
	In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	They say King John sore sick hath left the field.	999
	999
	[Enter MELUN, wounded]	999
	999
MELUN	Lead me to the revolts of England here.	999
	999
SALISBURY	When we were happy we had other names.	999
	999
PEMBROKE	It is the Count Melun.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Wounded to death.	999
	999
MELUN	Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;	999
	Unthread the rude eye of rebellion	999
	And welcome home again discarded faith.	999
	Seek out King John and fall before his feet;	999
	For if the French be lords of this loud day,	999
	He means to recompense the pains you take	999
	By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn	999
	And I with him, and many moe with me,	999
	Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;	999
	Even on that altar where we swore to you	999
	Dear amity and everlasting love.	999
	999
SALISBURY	May this be possible? may this be true?	999
	999
MELUN	Have I not hideous death within my view,	999
	Retaining but a quantity of life,	999
	Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax	999
	Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?	999
	What in the world should make me now deceive,	999
	Since I must lose the use of all deceit?	999
	Why should I then be false, since it is true	999
	That I must die here and live hence by truth?	999
	I say again, if Lewis do win the day,	999
	He is forsworn, if e'er those eyes of yours	999
	Behold another day break in the east:	999
	But even this night, whose black contagious breath	999
	Already smokes about the burning crest	999
	Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,	999
	Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,	999
	Paying the fine of rated treachery	999
	Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,	999
	If Lewis by your assistance win the day.	999
	Commend me to one Hubert with your king:	999
	The love of him, and this respect besides,	999
	For that my grandsire was an Englishman,	999
	Awakes my conscience to confess all this.	999
	In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence	999
	From forth the noise and rumour of the field,	999
	Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts	999
	In peace, and part this body and my soul	999
	With contemplation and devout desires.	999
	999
SALISBURY	We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul	999
	But I do love the favour and the form	999
	Of this most fair occasion, by the which	999
	We will untread the steps of damned flight,	999
	And like a bated and retired flood,	999
	Leaving our rankness and irregular course,	999
	Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd	999
	And cabby run on in obedience	999
	Even to our ocean, to our great King John.	999
	My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;	999
	For I do see the cruel pangs of death	999
	Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;	999
	And happy newness, that intends old right.	999

LEWIS	The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,	999
	But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,	999
	When English measure backward their own ground	999
	In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,	999
	When with a volley of our needless shot,	999
	After such bloody toil, we bid good night;	999
	And wound our tattering colours clearly up,	999
	Last in the field, and almost lords of it!	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	Where is my prince, the Dauphin?	999
	999
LEWIS	Here: what news?	999
	999
Messenger	The Count Melun is slain; the English lords	999
	By his persuasion are again fall'n off,	999
	And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,	999
	Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.	999
	999
LEWIS	Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!	999
	I did not think to be so sad to-night	999
	As this hath made me. Who was he that said	999
	King John did fly an hour or two before	999
	The stumbling night did part our weary powers?	999
	999
Messenger	Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.	999
	999
LEWIS	Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:	999

	999
HUBERT	Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.	999
	999
BASTARD	A friend. What art thou?	999
	999
HUBERT	Of the part of England.	999
	999
BASTARD	Whither dost thou go?	999
	999
HUBERT	What's that to thee? why may not I demand	999
	Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?	999
	999
BASTARD	Hubert, I think?	999
	999
HUBERT	                  Thou hast a perfect thought:	999
	I will upon all hazards well believe	999
	Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well.	999
	Who art thou?	999
	999
BASTARD	                  Who thou wilt: and if thou please,	999
	Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think	999
	I come one way of the Plantagenets.	999
	999
HUBERT	Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night	999
	Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,	999
	That any accent breaking from thy tongue	999
	Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.	999
	999
BASTARD	Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?	999
	999
HUBERT	Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,	999
	To find you out.	999
	999
BASTARD	                  Brief, then; and what's the news?	999
	999
HUBERT	O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,	999
	Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible.	999
	999
BASTARD	Show me the very wound of this ill news:	999
	I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.	999
	999
HUBERT	The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:	999
	I left him almost speechless; and broke out	999
	To acquaint you with this evil, that you might	999
	The better arm you to the sudden time,	999
	Than if you had at leisure known of this.	999
	999
BASTARD	How did he take it? who did taste to him?	999
	999
HUBERT	A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,	999
	Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king	999
	Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.	999
	999
BASTARD	Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?	999
	999
HUBERT	Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,	999
	And brought Prince Henry in their company;	999
	At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,	999
	And they are all about his majesty.	999
	999
BASTARD	Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,	999
	And tempt us not to bear above our power!	999
	I'll tell tree, Hubert, half my power this night,	999
	Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;	999
	These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;	999
	Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped.	999
	Away before: conduct me to the king;	999
	I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.	999

SCENE VII	The orchard in Swinstead Abbey.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter PRINCE HENRY, SALISBURY, and BIGOT]	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	It is too late: the life of all his blood	999
	Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,	999
	Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,	999
	Doth by the idle comments that it makes	999
	Foretell the ending of mortality.	999
	999
	[Enter PEMBROKE]	999
	999
PEMBROKE	His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief	999
	That, being brought into the open air,	999
	It would allay the burning quality	999
	Of that fell poison which assaileth him.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Let him be brought into the orchard here.	999
	Doth he still rage?	999
	999
	[Exit BIGOT]	999
	999
PEMBROKE	He is more patient	999
	Than when you left him; even now he sung.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes	999
	In their continuance will not feel themselves.	999
	Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,	999
	Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now	999
	Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds	999
	With many legions of strange fantasies,	999
	Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,	999
	Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death	999
	should sing.	999
	I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,	999
	Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,	999
	And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings	999
	His soul and body to their lasting rest.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born	999
	To set a form upon that indigest	999
	Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.	999
	999
	[Enter Attendants, and BIGOT, carrying KING JOHN in a chair]	999
	999
KING JOHN	Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;	999
	It would not out at windows nor at doors.	999
	There is so hot a summer in my bosom,	999
	That all my bowels crumble up to dust:	999
	I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen	999
	Upon a parchment, and against this fire	999
	Do I shrink up.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	                  How fares your majesty?	999
	999
KING JOHN	Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:	999
	And none of you will bid the winter come	999
	To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,	999
	Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course	999
	Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north	999
	To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips	999
	And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,	999
	I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait	999
	And so ingrateful, you deny me that.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	O that there were some virtue in my tears,	999
	That might relieve you!	999
	999
KING JOHN	The salt in them is hot.	999
	Within me is a hell; and there the poison	999
	Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize	999
	On unreprievable condemned blood.	999
	999
	[Enter the BASTARD]	999
	999
BASTARD	O, I am scalded with my violent motion,	999
	And spleen of speed to see your majesty!	999
	999
KING JOHN	O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:	999
	The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,	999
	And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail	999
	Are turned to one thread, one little hair:	999
	My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,	999
	Which holds but till thy news be uttered;	999
	And then all this thou seest is but a clod	999
	And module of confounded royalty.	999
	999
BASTARD	The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,	999
	Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;	999
	For in a night the best part of my power,	999
	As I upon advantage did remove,	999
	Were in the Washes all unwarily	999
	Devoured by the unexpected flood.	999
	999
	[KING JOHN dies]	999
	999
SALISBURY	You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.	999
	My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	Even so must I run on, and even so stop.	999
	What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,	999
	When this was now a king, and now is clay?	999
	999
BASTARD	Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind	999
	To do the office for thee of revenge,	999
	And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,	999
	As it on earth hath been thy servant still.	999
	Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,	999
	Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,	999
	And instantly return with me again,	999
	To push destruction and perpetual shame	999
	Out of the weak door of our fainting land.	999
	Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;	999
	The Dauphin rages at our very heels.	999
	999
SALISBURY	It seems you know not, then, so much as we:	999
	The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,	999
	Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,	999
	And brings from him such offers of our peace	999
	As we with honour and respect may take,	999
	With purpose presently to leave this war.	999
	999
BASTARD	He will the rather do it when he sees	999
	Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.	999
	999
SALISBURY	Nay, it is in a manner done already;	999
	For many carriages he hath dispatch'd	999
	To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel	999
	To the disposing of the cardinal:	999
	With whom yourself, myself and other lords,	999
	If you think meet, this afternoon will post	999
	To consummate this business happily.	999
	999
BASTARD	Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,	999
	With other princes that may best be spared,	999
	Shall wait upon your father's funeral.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	At Worcester must his body be interr'd;	999
	For so he will'd it.	999
	999
BASTARD	Thither shall it then:	999
	And happily may your sweet self put on	999
	The lineal state and glory of the land!	999
	To whom with all submission, on my knee	999
	I do bequeath my faithful services	999
	And true subjection everlastingly.	999
	999
SALISBURY	And the like tender of our love we make,	999
	To rest without a spot for evermore.	999
	999
PRINCE HENRY	I have a kind soul that would give you thanks	999
	And knows not how to do it but with tears.	999
	999
BASTARD	O, let us pay the time but needful woe,	999
	Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.	999
	This England never did, nor never shall,	999
	Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,	999
	But when it first did help to wound itself.	999
	Now these her princes are come home again,	999
	Come the three corners of the world in arms,	999
	And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,	999
	If England to itself do rest but true.	999

	999
	[Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other	999
	Nobles and Attendants]	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,	999
	Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,	999
	Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,	999
	Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,	999
	Which then our leisure would not let us hear,	999
	Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	I have, my liege.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,	999
	If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;	999
	Or worthily, as a good subject should,	999
	On some known ground of treachery in him?	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	As near as I could sift him on that argument,	999
	On some apparent danger seen in him	999
	Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Then call them to our presence; face to face,	999
	And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear	999
	The accuser and the accused freely speak:	999
	High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,	999
	In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.	999
	999
	[Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY]	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Many years of happy days befal	999
	My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!	999
	999
THOMAS MOWBRAY	Each day still better other's happiness;	999
	Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,	999
	Add an immortal title to your crown!	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,	999
	As well appeareth by the cause you come;	999
	Namely to appeal each other of high treason.	999
	Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object	999
	Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	First, heaven be the record to my speech!	999
	In the devotion of a subject's love,	999
	Tendering the precious safety of my prince,	999
	And free from other misbegotten hate,	999
	Come I appellant to this princely presence.	999
	Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,	999
	And mark my greeting well; for what I speak	999
	My body shall make good upon this earth,	999
	Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.	999
	Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,	999
	Too good to be so and too bad to live,	999
	Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,	999
	The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.	999
	Once more, the more to aggravate the note,	999
	With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;	999
	And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,	999
	What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.	999
	999
THOMAS MOWBRAY	Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:	999
	'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,	999
	The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,	999
	Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;	999
	The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:	999
	Yet can I not of such tame patience boast	999
	As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:	999
	First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me	999
	From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;	999
	Which else would post until it had return'd	999
	These terms of treason doubled down his throat.	999
	Setting aside his high blood's royalty,	999
	And let him be no kinsman to my liege,	999
	I do defy him, and I spit at him;	999
	Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:	999
	Which to maintain I would allow him odds,	999
	And meet him, were I tied to run afoot	999
	Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,	999
	Or any other ground inhabitable,	999
	Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.	999
	Mean time let this defend my loyalty,	999
	By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,	999
	Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,	999
	And lay aside my high blood's royalty,	999
	Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.	999
	If guilty dread have left thee so much strength	999
	As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:	999
	By that and all the rites of knighthood else,	999
	Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,	999
	What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.	999
	999
THOMAS MOWBRAY	I take it up; and by that sword I swear	999
	Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,	999
	I'll answer thee in any fair degree,	999
	Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:	999
	And when I mount, alive may I not light,	999
	If I be traitor or unjustly fight!	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?	999
	It must be great that can inherit us	999
	So much as of a thought of ill in him.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;	999
	That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles	999
	In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,	999
	The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,	999
	Like a false traitor and injurious villain.	999
	Besides I say and will in battle prove,	999
	Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge	999
	That ever was survey'd by English eye,	999
	That all the treasons for these eighteen years	999
	Complotted and contrived in this land	999
	Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.	999
	Further I say and further will maintain	999
	Upon his bad life to make all this good,	999
	That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,	999
	Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,	999
	And consequently, like a traitor coward,	999
	Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:	999
	Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,	999
	Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,	999
	To me for justice and rough chastisement;	999
	And, by the glorious worth of my descent,	999
	This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	How high a pitch his resolution soars!	999
	Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?	999
	999
THOMAS MOWBRAY	O, let my sovereign turn away his face	999
	And bid his ears a little while be deaf,	999
	Till I have told this slander of his blood,	999
	How God and good men hate so foul a liar.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:	999
	Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,	999
	As he is but my father's brother's son,	999
	Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,	999
	Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood	999
	Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize	999
	The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:	999
	He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:	999
	Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.	999
	999
THOMAS MOWBRAY	Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,	999
	Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.	999
	Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais	999
	Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;	999
	The other part reserved I by consent,	999
	For that my sovereign liege was in my debt	999
	Upon remainder of a dear account,	999
	Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:	999
	Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,	999
	I slew him not; but to my own disgrace	999
	Neglected my sworn duty in that case.	999
	For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,	999
	The honourable father to my foe	999
	Once did I lay an ambush for your life,	999
	A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul	999
	But ere I last received the sacrament	999
	I did confess it, and exactly begg'd	999
	Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.	999
	This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,	999
	It issues from the rancour of a villain,	999
	A recreant and most degenerate traitor	999
	Which in myself I boldly will defend;	999
	And interchangeably hurl down my gage	999
	Upon this overweening traitor's foot,	999
	To prove myself a loyal gentleman	999
	Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.	999
	In haste whereof, most heartily I pray	999
	Your highness to assign our trial day.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;	999
	Let's purge this choler without letting blood:	999
	This we prescribe, though no physician;	999
	Deep malice makes too deep incision;	999
	Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;	999
	Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.	999
	Good uncle, let this end where it begun;	999
	We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	To be a make-peace shall become my age:	999
	Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	And, Norfolk, throw down his.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	When, Harry, when?	999
	Obedience bids I should not bid again.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.	999
	999
THOMAS MOWBRAY	Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.	999
	My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:	999
	The one my duty owes; but my fair name,	999
	Despite of death that lives upon my grave,	999
	To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.	999
	I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,	999
	Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,	999
	The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood	999
	Which breathed this poison.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Rage must be withstood:	999
	Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.	999
	999
THOMAS MOWBRAY	Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.	999
	And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,	999
	The purest treasure mortal times afford	999
	Is spotless reputation: that away,	999
	Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.	999
	A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest	999
	Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.	999
	Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:	999
	Take honour from me, and my life is done:	999
	Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;	999
	In that I live and for that will I die.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!	999
	Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?	999
	Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height	999
	Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue	999
	Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,	999
	Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear	999
	The slavish motive of recanting fear,	999
	And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,	999
	Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.	999
	999
	[Exit JOHN OF GAUNT]	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	We were not born to sue, but to command;	999
	Which since we cannot do to make you friends,	999
	Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,	999
	At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:	999
	There shall your swords and lances arbitrate	999
	The swelling difference of your settled hate:	999
	Since we can not atone you, we shall see	999
	Justice design the victor's chivalry.	999
	Lord marshal, command our officers at arms	999
	Be ready to direct these home alarms.	999

SCENE II	The DUKE OF LANCASTER'S palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with DUCHESS]	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood	999
	Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,	999
	To stir against the butchers of his life!	999
	But since correction lieth in those hands	999
	Which made the fault that we cannot correct,	999
	Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;	999
	Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,	999
	Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.	999
	999
DUCHESS	Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?	999
	Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?	999
	Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,	999
	Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,	999
	Or seven fair branches springing from one root:	999
	Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,	999
	Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;	999
	But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,	999
	One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,	999
	One flourishing branch of his most royal root,	999
	Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,	999
	Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,	999
	By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.	999
	Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,	999
	That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee	999
	Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,	999
	Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent	999
	In some large measure to thy father's death,	999
	In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,	999
	Who was the model of thy father's life.	999
	Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:	999
	In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,	999
	Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,	999
	Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:	999
	That which in mean men we intitle patience	999
	Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.	999
	What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,	999
	The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,	999
	His deputy anointed in His sight,	999
	Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,	999
	Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift	999
	An angry arm against His minister.	999
	999
DUCHESS	Where then, alas, may I complain myself?	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	To God, the widow's champion and defence.	999
	999
DUCHESS	Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.	999
	Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold	999
	Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:	999
	O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,	999
	That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!	999
	Or, if misfortune miss the first career,	999
	Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,	999
	They may break his foaming courser's back,	999
	And throw the rider headlong in the lists,	999
	A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!	999
	Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife	999
	With her companion grief must end her life.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:	999
	As much good stay with thee as go with me!	999
	999
DUCHESS	Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,	999
	Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:	999
	I take my leave before I have begun,	999
	For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.	999
	Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.	999
	Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;	999
	Though this be all, do not so quickly go;	999
	I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--	999
	With all good speed at Plashy visit me.	999
	Alack, and what shall good old York there see	999
	But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,	999
	Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?	999
	And what hear there for welcome but my groans?	999
	Therefore commend me; let him not come there,	999
	To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.	999
	Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:	999
	The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.	999

	999
Lord Marshal	My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.	999
	999
Lord Marshal	The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,	999
	Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay	999
	For nothing but his majesty's approach.	999
	999
	[The trumpets sound, and KING RICHARD enters with	999
	his nobles, JOHN OF GAUNT, BUSHY, BAGOT, GREEN, and	999
	others. When they are set, enter THOMAS MOWBRAY in	999
	arms, defendant, with a Herald]	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Marshal, demand of yonder champion	999
	The cause of his arrival here in arms:	999
	Ask him his name and orderly proceed	999
	To swear him in the justice of his cause.	999
	999
Lord Marshal	In God's name and the king's, say who thou art	999
	And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,	999
	Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:	999
	Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;	999
	As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!	999
	999
THOMAS MOWBRAY	My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;	999
	Who hither come engaged by my oath--	999
	Which God defend a knight should violate!--	999
	Both to defend my loyalty and truth	999
	To God, my king and my succeeding issue,	999
	Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me	999
	And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,	999
	To prove him, in defending of myself,	999
	A traitor to my God, my king, and me:	999
	And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!	999
	999
	[The trumpets sound. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE,	999
	appellant, in armour, with a Herald]	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,	999
	Both who he is and why he cometh hither	999
	Thus plated in habiliments of war,	999
	And formally, according to our law,	999
	Depose him in the justice of his cause.	999
	999
Lord Marshal	What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,	999
	Before King Richard in his royal lists?	999
	Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?	999
	Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby	999
	Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,	999
	To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,	999
	In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,	999
	That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,	999
	To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;	999
	And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!	999
	999
Lord Marshal	On pain of death, no person be so bold	999
	Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,	999
	Except the marshal and such officers	999
	Appointed to direct these fair designs.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,	999
	And bow my knee before his majesty:	999
	For Mowbray and myself are like two men	999
	That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;	999
	Then let us take a ceremonious leave	999
	And loving farewell of our several friends.	999
	999
Lord Marshal	The appellant in all duty greets your highness,	999
	And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	We will descend and fold him in our arms.	999
	Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,	999
	So be thy fortune in this royal fight!	999
	Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,	999
	Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	O let no noble eye profane a tear	999
	For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:	999
	As confident as is the falcon's flight	999
	Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.	999
	My loving lord, I take my leave of you;	999
	Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;	999
	Not sick, although I have to do with death,	999
	But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.	999
	Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet	999
	The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:	999
	O thou, the earthly author of my blood,	999
	Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,	999
	Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up	999
	To reach at victory above my head,	999
	Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;	999
	And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,	999
	That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,	999
	And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,	999
	Even in the lusty havior of his son.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!	999
	Be swift like lightning in the execution;	999
	And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,	999
	Fall like amazing thunder on the casque	999
	Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:	999
	Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!	999
	999
THOMAS MOWBRAY	However God or fortune cast my lot,	999
	There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,	999
	A loyal, just and upright gentleman:	999
	Never did captive with a freer heart	999
	Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace	999
	His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,	999
	More than my dancing soul doth celebrate	999
	This feast of battle with mine adversary.	999
	Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,	999
	Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:	999
	As gentle and as jocund as to jest	999
	Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Farewell, my lord: securely I espy	999
	Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.	999
	Order the trial, marshal, and begin.	999
	999
Lord Marshal	Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,	999
	Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.	999
	999
Lord Marshal	Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.	999
	999
First Herald	Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,	999
	Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,	999
	On pain to be found false and recreant,	999
	To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,	999
	A traitor to his God, his king and him;	999
	And dares him to set forward to the fight.	999
	999
Second Herald	Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,	999
	On pain to be found false and recreant,	999
	Both to defend himself and to approve	999
	Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,	999
	To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;	999
	Courageously and with a free desire	999
	Attending but the signal to begin.	999
	999
Lord Marshal	Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.	999
	999
	[A charge sounded]	999
	999
	Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,	999
	And both return back to their chairs again:	999
	Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound	999
	While we return these dukes what we decree.	999
	999
	[A long flourish]	999
	999
	Draw near,	999
	And list what with our council we have done.	999
	For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd	999
	With that dear blood which it hath fostered;	999
	And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect	999
	Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;	999
	And for we think the eagle-winged pride	999
	Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,	999
	With rival-hating envy, set on you	999
	To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle	999
	Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;	999
	Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,	999
	With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,	999
	And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,	999
	Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace	999
	And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,	999
	Therefore, we banish you our territories:	999
	You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,	999
	Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields	999
	Shall not regreet our fair dominions,	999
	But tread the stranger paths of banishment.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Your will be done: this must my comfort be,	999
	Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;	999
	And those his golden beams to you here lent	999
	Shall point on me and gild my banishment.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,	999
	Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:	999
	The sly slow hours shall not determinate	999
	The dateless limit of thy dear exile;	999
	The hopeless word of 'never to return'	999
	Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.	999
	999
THOMAS MOWBRAY	A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,	999
	And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:	999
	A dearer merit, not so deep a maim	999
	As to be cast forth in the common air,	999
	Have I deserved at your highness' hands.	999
	The language I have learn'd these forty years,	999
	My native English, now I must forego:	999
	And now my tongue's use is to me no more	999
	Than an unstringed viol or a harp,	999
	Or like a cunning instrument cased up,	999
	Or, being open, put into his hands	999
	That knows no touch to tune the harmony:	999
	Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,	999
	Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;	999
	And dull unfeeling barren ignorance	999
	Is made my gaoler to attend on me.	999
	I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,	999
	Too far in years to be a pupil now:	999
	What is thy sentence then but speechless death,	999
	Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	It boots thee not to be compassionate:	999
	After our sentence plaining comes too late.	999
	999
THOMAS MOWBRAY	Then thus I turn me from my country's light,	999
	To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Return again, and take an oath with thee.	999
	Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;	999
	Swear by the duty that you owe to God--	999
	Our part therein we banish with yourselves--	999
	To keep the oath that we administer:	999
	You never shall, so help you truth and God!	999
	Embrace each other's love in banishment;	999
	Nor never look upon each other's face;	999
	Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile	999
	This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;	999
	Nor never by advised purpose meet	999
	To plot, contrive, or complot any ill	999
	'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I swear.	999
	999
THOMAS MOWBRAY	And I, to keep all this.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--	999
	By this time, had the king permitted us,	999
	One of our souls had wander'd in the air.	999
	Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,	999
	As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:	999
	Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;	999
	Since thou hast far to go, bear not along	999
	The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.	999
	999
THOMAS MOWBRAY	No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,	999
	My name be blotted from the book of life,	999
	And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!	999
	But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;	999
	And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.	999
	Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;	999
	Save back to England, all the world's my way.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes	999
	I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect	999
	Hath from the number of his banish'd years	999
	Pluck'd four away.	999
	999
	[To HENRY BOLINGBROKE]	999
	999
	Six frozen winter spent,	999
	Return with welcome home from banishment.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	How long a time lies in one little word!	999
	Four lagging winters and four wanton springs	999
	End in a word: such is the breath of kings.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	I thank my liege, that in regard of me	999
	He shortens four years of my son's exile:	999
	But little vantage shall I reap thereby;	999
	For, ere the six years that he hath to spend	999
	Can change their moons and bring their times about	999
	My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light	999
	Shall be extinct with age and endless night;	999
	My inch of taper will be burnt and done,	999
	And blindfold death not let me see my son.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:	999
	Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,	999
	And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;	999
	Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,	999
	But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;	999
	Thy word is current with him for my death,	999
	But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,	999
	Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:	999
	Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.	999
	You urged me as a judge; but I had rather	999
	You would have bid me argue like a father.	999
	O, had it been a stranger, not my child,	999
	To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:	999
	A partial slander sought I to avoid,	999
	And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.	999
	Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,	999
	I was too strict to make mine own away;	999
	But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue	999
	Against my will to do myself this wrong.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:	999
	Six years we banish him, and he shall go.	999
	999
	[Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD II and train]	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,	999
	From where you do remain let paper show.	999
	999
Lord Marshal	My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,	999
	As far as land will let me, by your side.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,	999
	That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I have too few to take my leave of you,	999
	When the tongue's office should be prodigal	999
	To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Joy absent, grief is present for that time.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	What is six winters? they are quickly gone.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,	999
	Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	The sullen passage of thy weary steps	999
	Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set	999
	The precious jewel of thy home return.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make	999
	Will but remember me what a deal of world	999
	I wander from the jewels that I love.	999
	Must I not serve a long apprenticehood	999
	To foreign passages, and in the end,	999
	Having my freedom, boast of nothing else	999
	But that I was a journeyman to grief?	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	All places that the eye of heaven visits	999
	Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.	999
	Teach thy necessity to reason thus;	999
	There is no virtue like necessity.	999
	Think not the king did banish thee,	999
	But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,	999
	Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.	999
	Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour	999
	And not the king exiled thee; or suppose	999
	Devouring pestilence hangs in our air	999
	And thou art flying to a fresher clime:	999
	Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it	999
	To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:	999
	Suppose the singing birds musicians,	999
	The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,	999
	The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more	999
	Than a delightful measure or a dance;	999
	For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite	999
	The man that mocks at it and sets it light.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	O, who can hold a fire in his hand	999
	By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?	999
	Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite	999
	By bare imagination of a feast?	999
	Or wallow naked in December snow	999
	By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?	999
	O, no! the apprehension of the good	999
	Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:	999
	Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more	999
	Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:	999
	Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;	999
	My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!	999
	Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,	999
	Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.	999

SCENE IV	The court.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING RICHARD II, with BAGOT and GREEN at one	999
	door; and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another]	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,	999
	How far brought you high Hereford on his way?	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,	999
	But to the next highway, and there I left him.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	And say, what store of parting tears were shed?	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,	999
	Which then blew bitterly against our faces,	999
	Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance	999
	Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	What said our cousin when you parted with him?	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	'Farewell:'	999
	And, for my heart disdained that my tongue	999
	Should so profane the word, that taught me craft	999
	To counterfeit oppression of such grief	999
	That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.	999
	Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours	999
	And added years to his short banishment,	999
	He should have had a volume of farewells;	999
	But since it would not, he had none of me.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,	999
	When time shall call him home from banishment,	999
	Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.	999
	Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green	999
	Observed his courtship to the common people;	999
	How he did seem to dive into their hearts	999
	With humble and familiar courtesy,	999
	What reverence he did throw away on slaves,	999
	Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles	999
	And patient underbearing of his fortune,	999
	As 'twere to banish their affects with him.	999
	Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;	999
	A brace of draymen bid God speed him well	999
	And had the tribute of his supple knee,	999
	With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'	999
	As were our England in reversion his,	999
	And he our subjects' next degree in hope.	999
	999
GREEN	Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.	999
	Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,	999
	Expedient manage must be made, my liege,	999
	Ere further leisure yield them further means	999
	For their advantage and your highness' loss.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	We will ourself in person to this war:	999
	And, for our coffers, with too great a court	999
	And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,	999
	We are inforced to farm our royal realm;	999
	The revenue whereof shall furnish us	999
	For our affairs in hand: if that come short,	999
	Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;	999
	Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,	999
	They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold	999
	And send them after to supply our wants;	999
	For we will make for Ireland presently.	999
	999
	[Enter BUSHY]	999
	999
	Bushy, what news?	999
	999
BUSHY	Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,	999
	Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste	999
	To entreat your majesty to visit him.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Where lies he?	999
	999
BUSHY	At Ely House.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Now put it, God, in the physician's mind	999
	To help him to his grave immediately!	999
	The lining of his coffers shall make coats	999
	To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.	999
	Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:	999
	Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!	999
	999
All	Amen.	999

SCENE I	Ely House.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter JOHN OF GAUNT sick, with the DUKE OF YORK,	999
	&c]	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	Will the king come, that I may breathe my last	999
	In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;	999
	For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	O, but they say the tongues of dying men	999
	Enforce attention like deep harmony:	999
	Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,	999
	For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.	999
	He that no more must say is listen'd more	999
	Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;	999
	More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:	999
	The setting sun, and music at the close,	999
	As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,	999
	Writ in remembrance more than things long past:	999
	Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,	999
	My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,	999
	As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,	999
	Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound	999
	The open ear of youth doth always listen;	999
	Report of fashions in proud Italy,	999
	Whose manners still our tardy apish nation	999
	Limps after in base imitation.	999
	Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--	999
	So it be new, there's no respect how vile--	999
	That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?	999
	Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,	999
	Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.	999
	Direct not him whose way himself will choose:	999
	'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	Methinks I am a prophet new inspired	999
	And thus expiring do foretell of him:	999
	His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,	999
	For violent fires soon burn out themselves;	999
	Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;	999
	He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;	999
	With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:	999
	Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,	999
	Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.	999
	This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,	999
	This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,	999
	This other Eden, demi-paradise,	999
	This fortress built by Nature for herself	999
	Against infection and the hand of war,	999
	This happy breed of men, this little world,	999
	This precious stone set in the silver sea,	999
	Which serves it in the office of a wall,	999
	Or as a moat defensive to a house,	999
	Against the envy of less happier lands,	999
	This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,	999
	This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,	999
	Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,	999
	Renowned for their deeds as far from home,	999
	For Christian service and true chivalry,	999
	As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,	999
	Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,	999
	This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,	999
	Dear for her reputation through the world,	999
	Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,	999
	Like to a tenement or pelting farm:	999
	England, bound in with the triumphant sea	999
	Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege	999
	Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,	999
	With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:	999
	That England, that was wont to conquer others,	999
	Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.	999
	Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,	999
	How happy then were my ensuing death!	999
	999
	[Enter KING RICHARD II and QUEEN, DUKE OF AUMERLE,	999
	BUSHY, GREEN, BAGOT, LORD ROSS, and LORD	999
	WILLOUGHBY]	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;	999
	For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.	999
	999
QUEEN	How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	O how that name befits my composition!	999
	Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:	999
	Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;	999
	And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?	999
	For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;	999
	Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:	999
	The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,	999
	Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;	999
	And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:	999
	Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,	999
	Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Can sick men play so nicely with their names?	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	No, misery makes sport to mock itself:	999
	Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,	999
	I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Should dying men flatter with those that live?	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	No, no, men living flatter those that die.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;	999
	Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.	999
	Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land	999
	Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;	999
	And thou, too careless patient as thou art,	999
	Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure	999
	Of those physicians that first wounded thee:	999
	A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,	999
	Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;	999
	And yet, incaged in so small a verge,	999
	The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.	999
	O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye	999
	Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,	999
	From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,	999
	Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,	999
	Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.	999
	Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,	999
	It were a shame to let this land by lease;	999
	But for thy world enjoying but this land,	999
	Is it not more than shame to shame it so?	999
	Landlord of England art thou now, not king:	999
	Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	         A lunatic lean-witted fool,	999
	Presuming on an ague's privilege,	999
	Darest with thy frozen admonition	999
	Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood	999
	With fury from his native residence.	999
	Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,	999
	Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,	999
	This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head	999
	Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.	999
	999
JOHN OF GAUNT	O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,	999
	For that I was his father Edward's son;	999
	That blood already, like the pelican,	999
	Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:	999
	My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,	999
	Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!	999
	May be a precedent and witness good	999
	That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:	999
	Join with the present sickness that I have;	999
	And thy unkindness be like crooked age,	999
	To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.	999
	Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!	999
	These words hereafter thy tormentors be!	999
	Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:	999
	Love they to live that love and honour have.	999
	999
	[Exit, borne off by his Attendants]	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	And let them die that age and sullens have;	999
	For both hast thou, and both become the grave.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	I do beseech your majesty, impute his words	999
	To wayward sickliness and age in him:	999
	He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear	999
	As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;	999
	As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.	999
	999
	[Enter NORTHUMBERLAND]	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	What says he?	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	                  Nay, nothing; all is said	999
	His tongue is now a stringless instrument;	999
	Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!	999
	Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;	999
	His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.	999
	So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:	999
	We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,	999
	Which live like venom where no venom else	999
	But only they have privilege to live.	999
	And for these great affairs do ask some charge,	999
	Towards our assistance we do seize to us	999
	The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,	999
	Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	How long shall I be patient? ah, how long	999
	Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?	999
	Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment	999
	Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,	999
	Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke	999
	About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,	999
	Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,	999
	Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.	999
	I am the last of noble Edward's sons,	999
	Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:	999
	In war was never lion raged more fierce,	999
	In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,	999
	Than was that young and princely gentleman.	999
	His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,	999
	Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;	999
	But when he frown'd, it was against the French	999
	And not against his friends; his noble hand	999
	Did will what he did spend and spent not that	999
	Which his triumphant father's hand had won;	999
	His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,	999
	But bloody with the enemies of his kin.	999
	O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,	999
	Or else he never would compare between.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Why, uncle, what's the matter?	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	O my liege,	999
	Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased	999
	Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.	999
	Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands	999
	The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?	999
	Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?	999
	Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?	999
	Did not the one deserve to have an heir?	999
	Is not his heir a well-deserving son?	999
	Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time	999
	His charters and his customary rights;	999
	Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;	999
	Be not thyself; for how art thou a king	999
	But by fair sequence and succession?	999
	Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--	999
	If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,	999
	Call in the letters patent that he hath	999
	By his attorneys-general to sue	999
	His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,	999
	You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,	999
	You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts	999
	And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts	999
	Which honour and allegiance cannot think.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Think what you will, we seize into our hands	999
	His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:	999
	What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;	999
	But by bad courses may be understood	999
	That their events can never fall out good.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:	999
	Bid him repair to us to Ely House	999
	To see this business. To-morrow next	999
	We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow:	999
	And we create, in absence of ourself,	999
	Our uncle York lord governor of England;	999
	For he is just and always loved us well.	999
	Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;	999
	Be merry, for our time of stay is short	999
	999
	[Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD II, QUEEN, DUKE OF	999
	AUMERLE, BUSHY, GREEN, and BAGOT]	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.	999
	999
LORD ROSS	And living too; for now his son is duke.	999
	999
LORD WILLOUGHBY	Barely in title, not in revenue.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Richly in both, if justice had her right.	999
	999
LORD ROSS	My heart is great; but it must break with silence,	999
	Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more	999
	That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!	999
	999
LORD WILLOUGHBY	Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?	999
	If it be so, out with it boldly, man;	999
	Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.	999
	999
LORD ROSS	No good at all that I can do for him;	999
	Unless you call it good to pity him,	999
	Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne	999
	In him, a royal prince, and many moe	999
	Of noble blood in this declining land.	999
	The king is not himself, but basely led	999
	By flatterers; and what they will inform,	999
	Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,	999
	That will the king severely prosecute	999
	'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.	999
	999
LORD ROSS	The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,	999
	And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined	999
	For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.	999
	999
LORD WILLOUGHBY	And daily new exactions are devised,	999
	As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:	999
	But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,	999
	But basely yielded upon compromise	999
	That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:	999
	More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.	999
	999
LORD ROSS	The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.	999
	999
LORD WILLOUGHBY	The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.	999
	999
LORD ROSS	He hath not money for these Irish wars,	999
	His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,	999
	But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!	999
	But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,	999
	Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;	999
	We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,	999
	And yet we strike not, but securely perish.	999
	999
LORD ROSS	We see the very wreck that we must suffer;	999
	And unavoided is the danger now,	999
	For suffering so the causes of our wreck.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death	999
	I spy life peering; but I dare not say	999
	How near the tidings of our comfort is.	999
	999
LORD WILLOUGHBY	Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.	999
	999
LORD ROSS	Be confident to speak, Northumberland:	999
	We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,	999
	Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay	999
	In Brittany, received intelligence	999
	That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,	999
	[                                               ]	999
	That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,	999
	His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,	999
	Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,	999
	Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,	999
	All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne	999
	With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,	999
	Are making hither with all due expedience	999
	And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:	999
	Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay	999
	The first departing of the king for Ireland.	999
	If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,	999
	Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,	999
	Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,	999
	Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt	999
	And make high majesty look like itself,	999
	Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;	999
	But if you faint, as fearing to do so,	999
	Stay and be secret, and myself will go.	999
	999
LORD ROSS	To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.	999
	999
LORD WILLOUGHBY	Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.	999

	KING RICHARD II	999
	999
	999
ACT II	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE II	The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT]	999
	999
BUSHY	Madam, your majesty is too much sad:	999
	You promised, when you parted with the king,	999
	To lay aside life-harming heaviness	999
	And entertain a cheerful disposition.	999
	999
QUEEN	To please the king I did; to please myself	999
	I cannot do it; yet I know no cause	999
	Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,	999
	Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest	999
	As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,	999
	Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,	999
	Is coming towards me, and my inward soul	999
	With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,	999
	More than with parting from my lord the king.	999
	999
BUSHY	Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,	999
	Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;	999
	For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,	999
	Divides one thing entire to many objects;	999
	Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon	999
	Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry	999
	Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,	999
	Looking awry upon your lord's departure,	999
	Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;	999
	Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows	999
	Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,	999
	More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;	999
	Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,	999
	Which for things true weeps things imaginary.	999
	999
QUEEN	It may be so; but yet my inward soul	999
	Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,	999
	I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad	999
	As, though on thinking on no thought I think,	999
	Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.	999
	999
BUSHY	'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.	999
	999
QUEEN	'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived	999
	From some forefather grief; mine is not so,	999
	For nothing had begot my something grief;	999
	Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:	999
	'Tis in reversion that I do possess;	999
	But what it is, that is not yet known; what	999
	I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.	999
	999
	[Enter GREEN]	999
	999
GREEN	God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:	999
	I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.	999
	999
QUEEN	Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;	999
	For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:	999
	Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?	999
	999
GREEN	That he, our hope, might have retired his power,	999
	And driven into despair an enemy's hope,	999
	Who strongly hath set footing in this land:	999
	The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,	999
	And with uplifted arms is safe arrived	999
	At Ravenspurgh.	999
	999
QUEEN	                  Now God in heaven forbid!	999
	999
GREEN	Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,	999
	The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,	999
	The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,	999
	With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.	999
	999
BUSHY	Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland	999
	And all the rest revolted faction traitors?	999
	999
GREEN	We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester	999
	Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,	999
	And all the household servants fled with him	999
	To Bolingbroke.	999
	999
QUEEN	So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,	999
	And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:	999
	Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,	999
	And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,	999
	Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.	999
	999
BUSHY	Despair not, madam.	999
	999
QUEEN	Who shall hinder me?	999
	I will despair, and be at enmity	999
	With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,	999
	A parasite, a keeper back of death,	999
	Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,	999
	Which false hope lingers in extremity.	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE OF YORK]	999
	999
GREEN	Here comes the Duke of York.	999
	999
QUEEN	With signs of war about his aged neck:	999
	O, full of careful business are his looks!	999
	Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:	999
	Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,	999
	Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.	999
	Your husband, he is gone to save far off,	999
	Whilst others come to make him lose at home:	999
	Here am I left to underprop his land,	999
	Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:	999
	Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;	999
	Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
Servant	My lord, your son was gone before I came.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!	999
	The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,	999
	And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.	999
	Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;	999
	Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:	999
	Hold, take my ring.	999
	999
Servant	My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,	999
	To-day, as I came by, I called there;	999
	But I shall grieve you to report the rest.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	What is't, knave?	999
	999
Servant	An hour before I came, the duchess died.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	God for his mercy! what a tide of woes	999
	Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!	999
	I know not what to do: I would to God,	999
	So my untruth had not provoked him to it,	999
	The king had cut off my head with my brother's.	999
	What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?	999
	How shall we do for money for these wars?	999
	Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me.	999
	Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts	999
	And bring away the armour that is there.	999
	999
	[Exit Servant]	999
	999
	Gentlemen, will you go muster men?	999
	If I know how or which way to order these affairs	999
	Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,	999
	Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:	999
	The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath	999
	And duty bids defend; the other again	999
	Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,	999
	Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.	999
	Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll	999
	Dispose of you.	999
	Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,	999
	And meet me presently at Berkeley.	999
	I should to Plashy too;	999
	But time will not permit: all is uneven,	999
	And every thing is left at six and seven.	999
	999
	[Exeunt DUKE OF YORK and QUEEN]	999
	999
BUSHY	The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,	999
	But none returns. For us to levy power	999
	Proportionable to the enemy	999
	Is all unpossible.	999
	999
GREEN	Besides, our nearness to the king in love	999
	Is near the hate of those love not the king.	999
	999
BAGOT	And that's the wavering commons: for their love	999
	Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them	999
	By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.	999
	999
BUSHY	Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.	999
	999
BAGOT	If judgement lie in them, then so do we,	999
	Because we ever have been near the king.	999
	999
GREEN	Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:	999
	The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.	999
	999
BUSHY	Thither will I with you; for little office	999
	The hateful commons will perform for us,	999
	Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.	999
	Will you go along with us?	999
	999
BAGOT	No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.	999
	Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,	999
	We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.	999
	999
BUSHY	That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.	999
	999
GREEN	Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes	999
	Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:	999
	Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.	999
	Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.	999
	999
BUSHY	Well, we may meet again.	999
	999
BAGOT	I fear me, never.	999

ACT II	999

	999
	999
SCENE III	Wilds in Gloucestershire.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and NORTHUMBERLAND, with Forces]	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Believe me, noble lord,	999
	I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:	999
	These high wild hills and rough uneven ways	999
	Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,	999
	And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,	999
	Making the hard way sweet and delectable.	999
	But I bethink me what a weary way	999
	From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found	999
	In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,	999
	Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled	999
	The tediousness and process of my travel:	999
	But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have	999
	The present benefit which I possess;	999
	And hope to joy is little less in joy	999
	Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords	999
	Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done	999
	By sight of what I have, your noble company.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Of much less value is my company	999
	Than your good words. But who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter HENRY PERCY]	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	It is my son, young Harry Percy,	999
	Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.	999
	Harry, how fares your uncle?	999
	999
HENRY PERCY	I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Why, is he not with the queen?	999
	999
HENRY PERCY	No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,	999
	Broken his staff of office and dispersed	999
	The household of the king.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	What was his reason?	999
	He was not so resolved when last we spake together.	999
	999
HENRY PERCY	Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.	999
	But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,	999
	To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,	999
	And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover	999
	What power the Duke of York had levied there;	999
	Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?	999
	999
HENRY PERCY	No, my good lord, for that is not forgot	999
	Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,	999
	I never in my life did look on him.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.	999
	999
HENRY PERCY	My gracious lord, I tender you my service,	999
	Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:	999
	Which elder days shall ripen and confirm	999
	To more approved service and desert.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure	999
	I count myself in nothing else so happy	999
	As in a soul remembering my good friends;	999
	And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,	999
	It shall be still thy true love's recompense:	999
	My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir	999
	Keeps good old York there with his men of war?	999
	999
HENRY PERCY	There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,	999
	Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;	999
	And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;	999
	None else of name and noble estimate.	999
	999
	[Enter LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY]	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,	999
	Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues	999
	A banish'd traitor: all my treasury	999
	Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd	999
	Shall be your love and labour's recompense.	999
	999
LORD ROSS	Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.	999
	999
LORD WILLOUGHBY	And far surmounts our labour to attain it.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;	999
	Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,	999
	Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter LORD BERKELEY]	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.	999
	999
LORD BERKELEY	My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;	999
	And I am come to seek that name in England;	999
	And I must find that title in your tongue,	999
	Before I make reply to aught you say.	999
	999
LORD BERKELEY	Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning	999
	To raze one title of your honour out:	999
	To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,	999
	From the most gracious regent of this land,	999
	The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on	999
	To take advantage of the absent time	999
	And fright our native peace with self-born arms.	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE OF YORK attended]	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I shall not need transport my words by you;	999
	Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!	999
	999
	[Kneels]	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,	999
	Whose duty is deceiveable and false.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My gracious uncle--	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Tut, tut!	999
	Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:	999
	I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'	999
	In an ungracious mouth is but profane.	999
	Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs	999
	Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?	999
	But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march	999
	So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,	999
	Frighting her pale-faced villages with war	999
	And ostentation of despised arms?	999
	Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?	999
	Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,	999
	And in my loyal bosom lies his power.	999
	Were I but now the lord of such hot youth	999
	As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself	999
	Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,	999
	From forth the ranks of many thousand French,	999
	O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.	999
	Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee	999
	And minister correction to thy fault!	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:	999
	On what condition stands it and wherein?	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Even in condition of the worst degree,	999
	In gross rebellion and detested treason:	999
	Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come	999
	Before the expiration of thy time,	999
	In braving arms against thy sovereign.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;	999
	But as I come, I come for Lancaster.	999
	And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace	999
	Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:	999
	You are my father, for methinks in you	999
	I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,	999
	Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd	999
	A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties	999
	Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away	999
	To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?	999
	If that my cousin king be King of England,	999
	It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.	999
	You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;	999
	Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,	999
	He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,	999
	To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.	999
	I am denied to sue my livery here,	999
	And yet my letters-patents give me leave:	999
	My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,	999
	And these and all are all amiss employ'd.	999
	What would you have me do? I am a subject,	999
	And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;	999
	And therefore, personally I lay my claim	999
	To my inheritance of free descent.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	The noble duke hath been too much abused.	999
	999
LORD ROSS	It stands your grace upon to do him right.	999
	999
LORD WILLOUGHBY	Base men by his endowments are made great.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	My lords of England, let me tell you this:	999
	I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs	999
	And laboured all I could to do him right;	999
	But in this kind to come, in braving arms,	999
	Be his own carver and cut out his way,	999
	To find out right with wrong, it may not be;	999
	And you that do abet him in this kind	999
	Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	The noble duke hath sworn his coming is	999
	But for his own; and for the right of that	999
	We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;	999
	And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:	999
	I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,	999
	Because my power is weak and all ill left:	999
	But if I could, by Him that gave me life,	999
	I would attach you all and make you stoop	999
	Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;	999
	But since I cannot, be it known to you	999
	I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;	999
	Unless you please to enter in the castle	999
	And there repose you for this night.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	An offer, uncle, that we will accept:	999
	But we must win your grace to go with us	999
	To Bristol castle, which they say is held	999
	By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,	999
	The caterpillars of the commonwealth,	999
	Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;	999
	For I am loath to break our country's laws.	999
	Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:	999
	Things past redress are now with me past care.	999

	999
	[Enter EARL OF SALISBURY and a Welsh Captain]	999
	999
Captain	My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,	999
	And hardly kept our countrymen together,	999
	And yet we hear no tidings from the king;	999
	Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.	999
	999
EARL OF SALISBURY	Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:	999
	The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.	999
	999
Captain	'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.	999
	The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd	999
	And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;	999
	The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth	999
	And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;	999
	Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,	999
	The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,	999
	The other to enjoy by rage and war:	999
	These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.	999
	Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,	999
	As well assured Richard their king is dead.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
EARL OF SALISBURY	Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind	999
	I see thy glory like a shooting star	999
	Fall to the base earth from the firmament.	999
	Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,	999
	Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:	999
	Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,	999
	And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.	999

	999
	[Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK,	999
	NORTHUMBERLAND, LORD ROSS, HENRY PERCY, LORD	999
	WILLOUGHBY, with BUSHY and GREEN, prisoners]	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Bring forth these men.	999
	Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--	999
	Since presently your souls must part your bodies--	999
	With too much urging your pernicious lives,	999
	For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood	999
	From off my hands, here in the view of men	999
	I will unfold some causes of your deaths.	999
	You have misled a prince, a royal king,	999
	A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,	999
	By you unhappied and disfigured clean:	999
	You have in manner with your sinful hours	999
	Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,	999
	Broke the possession of a royal bed	999
	And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks	999
	With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.	999
	Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,	999
	Near to the king in blood, and near in love	999
	Till you did make him misinterpret me,	999
	Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,	999
	And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,	999
	Eating the bitter bread of banishment;	999
	Whilst you have fed upon my signories,	999
	Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,	999
	From my own windows torn my household coat,	999
	Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,	999
	Save men's opinions and my living blood,	999
	To show the world I am a gentleman.	999
	This and much more, much more than twice all this,	999
	Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over	999
	To execution and the hand of death.	999
	999
BUSHY	More welcome is the stroke of death to me	999
	Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.	999
	999
GREEN	My comfort is that heaven will take our souls	999
	And plague injustice with the pains of hell.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.	999
	999
	[Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND and others, with the	999
	prisoners]	999
	999
	Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;	999
	For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:	999
	Tell her I send to her my kind commends;	999
	Take special care my greetings be deliver'd.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd	999
	With letters of your love to her at large.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.	999
	To fight with Glendower and his complices:	999
	Awhile to work, and after holiday.	999

SCENE II	The coast of Wales. A castle in view.	999
	999
	999
	[Drums; flourish and colours. Enter KING RICHARD	999
	II, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, and Soldiers]	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,	999
	After your late tossing on the breaking seas?	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy	999
	To stand upon my kingdom once again.	999
	Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,	999
	Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:	999
	As a long-parted mother with her child	999
	Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,	999
	So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,	999
	And do thee favours with my royal hands.	999
	Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,	999
	Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;	999
	But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,	999
	And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,	999
	Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet	999
	Which with usurping steps do trample thee:	999
	Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;	999
	And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,	999
	Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder	999
	Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch	999
	Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.	999
	Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:	999
	This earth shall have a feeling and these stones	999
	Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king	999
	Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.	999
	999
BISHOP OF CARLISLE	Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king	999
	Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.	999
	The means that heaven yields must be embraced,	999
	And not neglected; else, if heaven would,	999
	And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,	999
	The proffer'd means of succor and redress.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;	999
	Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,	999
	Grows strong and great in substance and in power.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not	999
	That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,	999
	Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,	999
	Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen	999
	In murders and in outrage, boldly here;	999
	But when from under this terrestrial ball	999
	He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines	999
	And darts his light through every guilty hole,	999
	Then murders, treasons and detested sins,	999
	The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,	999
	Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?	999
	So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,	999
	Who all this while hath revell'd in the night	999
	Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,	999
	Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,	999
	His treasons will sit blushing in his face,	999
	Not able to endure the sight of day,	999
	But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.	999
	Not all the water in the rough rude sea	999
	Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;	999
	The breath of worldly men cannot depose	999
	The deputy elected by the Lord:	999
	For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd	999
	To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,	999
	God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay	999
	A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,	999
	Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.	999
	999
	[Enter EARL OF SALISBURY]	999
	999
	Welcome, my lord	how far off lies your power?	999
	999
EARL OF SALISBURY	Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,	999
	Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue	999
	And bids me speak of nothing but despair.	999
	One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,	999
	Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:	999
	O, call back yesterday, bid time return,	999
	And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!	999
	To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,	999
	O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:	999
	For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.	999
	Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	But now the blood of twenty thousand men	999
	Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;	999
	And, till so much blood thither come again,	999
	Have I not reason to look pale and dead?	999
	All souls that will be safe fly from my side,	999
	For time hath set a blot upon my pride.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	I had forgot myself; am I not king?	999
	Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.	999
	Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?	999
	Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes	999
	At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,	999
	Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?	999
	High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York	999
	Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP]	999
	999
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	More health and happiness betide my liege	999
	Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;	999
	The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.	999
	Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care	999
	And what loss is it to be rid of care?	999
	Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?	999
	Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,	999
	We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:	999
	Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;	999
	They break their faith to God as well as us:	999
	Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:	999
	The worst is death, and death will have his day.	999
	999
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd	999
	To bear the tidings of calamity.	999
	Like an unseasonable stormy day,	999
	Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,	999
	As if the world were all dissolved to tears,	999
	So high above his limits swells the rage	999
	Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land	999
	With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.	999
	White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps	999
	Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,	999
	Strive to speak big and clap their female joints	999
	In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:	999
	The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows	999
	Of double-fatal yew against thy state;	999
	Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills	999
	Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,	999
	And all goes worse than I have power to tell.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.	999
	Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?	999
	What is become of Bushy? where is Green?	999
	That they have let the dangerous enemy	999
	Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?	999
	If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:	999
	I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.	999
	999
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!	999
	Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!	999
	Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!	999
	Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!	999
	Would they make peace? terrible hell make war	999
	Upon their spotted souls for this offence!	999
	999
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Sweet love, I see, changing his property,	999
	Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:	999
	Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made	999
	With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse	999
	Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound	999
	And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?	999
	999
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Where is the duke my father with his power?	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	No matter where; of comfort no man speak:	999
	Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;	999
	Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes	999
	Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,	999
	Let's choose executors and talk of wills:	999
	And yet not so, for what can we bequeath	999
	Save our deposed bodies to the ground?	999
	Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,	999
	And nothing can we call our own but death	999
	And that small model of the barren earth	999
	Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.	999
	For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground	999
	And tell sad stories of the death of kings;	999
	How some have been deposed; some slain in war,	999
	Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;	999
	Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;	999
	All murder'd: for within the hollow crown	999
	That rounds the mortal temples of a king	999
	Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,	999
	Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,	999
	Allowing him a breath, a little scene,	999
	To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,	999
	Infusing him with self and vain conceit,	999
	As if this flesh which walls about our life,	999
	Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus	999
	Comes at the last and with a little pin	999
	Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!	999
	Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood	999
	With solemn reverence: throw away respect,	999
	Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,	999
	For you have but mistook me all this while:	999
	I live with bread like you, feel want,	999
	Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,	999
	How can you say to me, I am a king?	999
	999
BISHOP OF CARLISLE	My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,	999
	But presently prevent the ways to wail.	999
	To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,	999
	Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,	999
	And so your follies fight against yourself.	999
	Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:	999
	And fight and die is death destroying death;	999
	Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	My father hath a power; inquire of him	999
	And learn to make a body of a limb.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come	999
	To change blows with thee for our day of doom.	999
	This ague fit of fear is over-blown;	999
	An easy task it is to win our own.	999
	Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?	999
	Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.	999
	999
SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Men judge by the complexion of the sky	999
	The state and inclination of the day:	999
	So may you by my dull and heavy eye,	999
	My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.	999
	I play the torturer, by small and small	999
	To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:	999
	Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,	999
	And all your northern castles yielded up,	999
	And all your southern gentlemen in arms	999
	Upon his party.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	                  Thou hast said enough.	999
	Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth	999
	999
	[To DUKE OF AUMERLE]	999
	999
	Of that sweet way I was in to despair!	999
	What say you now? what comfort have we now?	999
	By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly	999
	That bids me be of comfort any more.	999
	Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;	999
	A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.	999
	That power I have, discharge; and let them go	999
	To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,	999
	For I have none: let no man speak again	999
	To alter this, for counsel is but vain.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	My liege, one word.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	He does me double wrong	999
	That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.	999
	Discharge my followers: let them hence away,	999
	From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.	999

	999
SCENE III	Wales. Before Flint castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter, with drum and colours, HENRY BOLINGBROKE,	999
	DUKE OF YORK, NORTHUMBERLAND, Attendants, and forces]	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	So that by this intelligence we learn	999
	The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury	999
	Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed	999
	With some few private friends upon this coast.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	The news is very fair and good, my lord:	999
	Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	It would beseem the Lord Northumberland	999
	To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day	999
	When such a sacred king should hide his head.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Your grace mistakes; only to be brief	999
	Left I his title out.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	The time hath been,	999
	Would you have been so brief with him, he would	999
	Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,	999
	For taking so the head, your whole head's length.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Take not, good cousin, further than you should.	999
	Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself	999
	Against their will. But who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter HENRY PERCY]	999
	999
	Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?	999
	999
HENRY PERCY	The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,	999
	Against thy entrance.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Royally!	999
	Why, it contains no king?	999
	999
HENRY PERCY	Yes, my good lord,	999
	It doth contain a king; King Richard lies	999
	Within the limits of yon lime and stone:	999
	And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,	999
	Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman	999
	Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Noble lords,	999
	Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;	999
	Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley	999
	Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:	999
	Henry Bolingbroke	999
	On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand	999
	And sends allegiance and true faith of heart	999
	To his most royal person, hither come	999
	Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,	999
	Provided that my banishment repeal'd	999
	And lands restored again be freely granted:	999
	If not, I'll use the advantage of my power	999
	And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood	999
	Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:	999
	The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke	999
	It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench	999
	The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,	999
	My stooping duty tenderly shall show.	999
	Go, signify as much, while here we march	999
	Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.	999
	Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,	999
	That from this castle's tatter'd battlements	999
	Our fair appointments may be well perused.	999
	Methinks King Richard and myself should meet	999
	With no less terror than the elements	999
	Of fire and water, when their thundering shock	999
	At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.	999
	Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:	999
	The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain	999
	My waters; on the earth, and not on him.	999
	March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.	999
	999
	[Parle without, and answer within. Then a flourish.	999
	Enter on the walls, KING RICHARD II, the BISHOP OF	999
	CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, SIR STEPHEN SCROOP, and	999
	EARL OF SALISBURY]	999
	999
	See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,	999
	As doth the blushing discontented sun	999
	From out the fiery portal of the east,	999
	When he perceives the envious clouds are bent	999
	To dim his glory and to stain the track	999
	Of his bright passage to the occident.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,	999
	As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth	999
	Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,	999
	That any harm should stain so fair a show!	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	We are amazed; and thus long have we stood	999
	To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,	999
	999
	[To NORTHUMBERLAND]	999
	999
	Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:	999
	And if we be, how dare thy joints forget	999
	To pay their awful duty to our presence?	999
	If we be not, show us the hand of God	999
	That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;	999
	For well we know, no hand of blood and bone	999
	Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,	999
	Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.	999
	And though you think that all, as you have done,	999
	Have torn their souls by turning them from us,	999
	And we are barren and bereft of friends;	999
	Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,	999
	Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf	999
	Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike	999
	Your children yet unborn and unbegot,	999
	That lift your vassal hands against my head	999
	And threat the glory of my precious crown.	999
	Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--	999
	That every stride he makes upon my land	999
	Is dangerous treason: he is come to open	999
	The purple testament of bleeding war;	999
	But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,	999
	Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons	999
	Shall ill become the flower of England's face,	999
	Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace	999
	To scarlet indignation and bedew	999
	Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	The king of heaven forbid our lord the king	999
	Should so with civil and uncivil arms	999
	Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin	999
	Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;	999
	And by the honourable tomb he swears,	999
	That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,	999
	And by the royalties of both your bloods,	999
	Currents that spring from one most gracious head,	999
	And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,	999
	And by the worth and honour of himself,	999
	Comprising all that may be sworn or said,	999
	His coming hither hath no further scope	999
	Than for his lineal royalties and to beg	999
	Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:	999
	Which on thy royal party granted once,	999
	His glittering arms he will commend to rust,	999
	His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart	999
	To faithful service of your majesty.	999
	This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;	999
	And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Northumberland, say thus the king returns:	999
	His noble cousin is right welcome hither;	999
	And all the number of his fair demands	999
	Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:	999
	With all the gracious utterance thou hast	999
	Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.	999
	We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,	999
	999
	[To DUKE OF AUMERLE]	999
	999
	To look so poorly and to speak so fair?	999
	Shall we call back Northumberland, and send	999
	Defiance to the traitor, and so die?	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words	999
	Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,	999
	That laid the sentence of dread banishment	999
	On yon proud man, should take it off again	999
	With words of sooth! O that I were as great	999
	As is my grief, or lesser than my name!	999
	Or that I could forget what I have been,	999
	Or not remember what I must be now!	999
	Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,	999
	Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	What must the king do now? must he submit?	999
	The king shall do it: must he be deposed?	999
	The king shall be contented: must he lose	999
	The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:	999
	I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,	999
	My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,	999
	My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,	999
	My figured goblets for a dish of wood,	999
	My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,	999
	My subjects for a pair of carved saints	999
	And my large kingdom for a little grave,	999
	A little little grave, an obscure grave;	999
	Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,	999
	Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet	999
	May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;	999
	For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;	999
	And buried once, why not upon my head?	999
	Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!	999
	We'll make foul weather with despised tears;	999
	Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,	999
	And make a dearth in this revolting land.	999
	Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,	999
	And make some pretty match with shedding tears?	999
	As thus, to drop them still upon one place,	999
	Till they have fretted us a pair of graves	999
	Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies	999
	Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.	999
	Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see	999
	I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.	999
	Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,	999
	What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty	999
	Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?	999
	You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord, in the base court he doth attend	999
	To speak with you; may it please you to come down.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,	999
	Wanting the manage of unruly jades.	999
	In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,	999
	To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.	999
	In the base court? Come down? Down, court!	999
	down, king!	999
	For night-owls shriek where mounting larks	999
	should sing.	999
	999
	[Exeunt from above]	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	What says his majesty?	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Sorrow and grief of heart	999
	Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man	999
	Yet he is come.	999
	999
	[Enter KING RICHARD and his attendants below]	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Stand all apart,	999
	And show fair duty to his majesty.	999
	999
	[He kneels down]	999
	999
	My gracious lord,--	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee	999
	To make the base earth proud with kissing it:	999
	Me rather had my heart might feel your love	999
	Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.	999
	Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,	999
	Thus high at least, although your knee be low.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,	999
	As my true service shall deserve your love.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,	999
	That know the strong'st and surest way to get.	999
	Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;	999
	Tears show their love, but want their remedies.	999
	Cousin, I am too young to be your father,	999
	Though you are old enough to be my heir.	999
	What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;	999
	For do we must what force will have us do.	999
	Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Yea, my good lord.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Then I must not say no.	999

SCENE IV	LANGLEY. The DUKE OF YORK's garden.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the QUEEN and two Ladies]	999
	999
QUEEN	What sport shall we devise here in this garden,	999
	To drive away the heavy thought of care?	999
	999
Lady	Madam, we'll play at bowls.	999
	999
QUEEN	'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,	999
	And that my fortune rubs against the bias.	999
	999
Lady	Madam, we'll dance.	999
	999
QUEEN	My legs can keep no measure in delight,	999
	When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:	999
	Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.	999
	999
Lady	Madam, we'll tell tales.	999
	999
QUEEN	Of sorrow or of joy?	999
	999
Lady	Of either, madam.	999
	999
QUEEN	Of neither, girl:	999
	For of joy, being altogether wanting,	999
	It doth remember me the more of sorrow;	999
	Or if of grief, being altogether had,	999
	It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:	999
	For what I have I need not to repeat;	999
	And what I want it boots not to complain.	999
	999
Lady	Madam, I'll sing.	999
	999
QUEEN	'Tis well that thou hast cause	999
	But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.	999
	999
Lady	I could weep, madam, would it do you good.	999
	999
QUEEN	And I could sing, would weeping do me good,	999
	And never borrow any tear of thee.	999
	999
	[Enter a Gardener, and two Servants]	999
	999
	But stay, here come the gardeners:	999
	Let's step into the shadow of these trees.	999
	My wretchedness unto a row of pins,	999
	They'll talk of state; for every one doth so	999
	Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.	999
	999
	[QUEEN and Ladies retire]	999
	999
Gardener	Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,	999
	Which, like unruly children, make their sire	999
	Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:	999
	Give some supportance to the bending twigs.	999
	Go thou, and like an executioner,	999
	Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,	999
	That look too lofty in our commonwealth:	999
	All must be even in our government.	999
	You thus employ'd, I will go root away	999
	The noisome weeds, which without profit suck	999
	The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.	999
	999
Servant	Why should we in the compass of a pale	999
	Keep law and form and due proportion,	999
	Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,	999
	When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,	999
	Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,	999
	Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,	999
	Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs	999
	Swarming with caterpillars?	999
	999
Gardener	Hold thy peace:	999
	He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring	999
	Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:	999
	The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,	999
	That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,	999
	Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,	999
	I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.	999
	999
Servant	What, are they dead?	999
	999
Gardener	They are; and Bolingbroke	999
	Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it	999
	That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land	999
	As we this garden! We at time of year	999
	Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,	999
	Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,	999
	With too much riches it confound itself:	999
	Had he done so to great and growing men,	999
	They might have lived to bear and he to taste	999
	Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches	999
	We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:	999
	Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,	999
	Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.	999
	999
Servant	What, think you then the king shall be deposed?	999
	999
Gardener	Depress'd he is already, and deposed	999
	'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night	999
	To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,	999
	That tell black tidings.	999
	999
QUEEN	O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!	999
	999
	[Coming forward]	999
	999
	Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,	999
	How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?	999
	What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee	999
	To make a second fall of cursed man?	999
	Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?	999
	Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,	999
	Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,	999
	Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.	999
	999
Gardener	Pardon me, madam: little joy have I	999
	To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.	999
	King Richard, he is in the mighty hold	999
	Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:	999
	In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,	999
	And some few vanities that make him light;	999
	But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,	999
	Besides himself, are all the English peers,	999
	And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.	999
	Post you to London, and you will find it so;	999
	I speak no more than every one doth know.	999
	999
QUEEN	Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,	999
	Doth not thy embassage belong to me,	999
	And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st	999
	To serve me last, that I may longest keep	999
	Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,	999
	To meet at London London's king in woe.	999
	What, was I born to this, that my sad look	999
	Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?	999
	Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,	999
	Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.	999
	999
	[Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies]	999
	999
GARDENER	Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,	999
	I would my skill were subject to thy curse.	999
	Here did she fall a tear; here in this place	999
	I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:	999
	Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,	999
	In the remembrance of a weeping queen.	999

HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Call forth Bagot.	999
	Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;	999
	What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,	999
	Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd	999
	The bloody office of his timeless end.	999
	999
BAGOT	Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.	999
	999
BAGOT	My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue	999
	Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.	999
	In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,	999
	I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,	999
	That reacheth from the restful English court	999
	As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'	999
	Amongst much other talk, that very time,	999
	I heard you say that you had rather refuse	999
	The offer of an hundred thousand crowns	999
	Than Bolingbroke's return to England;	999
	Adding withal how blest this land would be	999
	In this your cousin's death.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Princes and noble lords,	999
	What answer shall I make to this base man?	999
	Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,	999
	On equal terms to give him chastisement?	999
	Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd	999
	With the attainder of his slanderous lips.	999
	There is my gage, the manual seal of death,	999
	That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,	999
	And will maintain what thou hast said is false	999
	In thy heart-blood, though being all too base	999
	To stain the temper of my knightly sword.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Excepting one, I would he were the best	999
	In all this presence that hath moved me so.	999
	999
LORD FITZWATER	If that thy valour stand on sympathy,	999
	There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:	999
	By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,	999
	I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it	999
	That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.	999
	If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;	999
	And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,	999
	Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.	999
	999
LORD FITZWATER	Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.	999
	999
HENRY PERCY	Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true	999
	In this appeal as thou art all unjust;	999
	And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,	999
	To prove it on thee to the extremest point	999
	Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	An if I do not, may my hands rot off	999
	And never brandish more revengeful steel	999
	Over the glittering helmet of my foe!	999
	999
Lord	I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;	999
	And spur thee on with full as many lies	999
	As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear	999
	From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;	999
	Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:	999
	I have a thousand spirits in one breast,	999
	To answer twenty thousand such as you.	999
	999
DUKE OF SURREY	My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well	999
	The very time Aumerle and you did talk.	999
	999
LORD FITZWATER	'Tis very true: you were in presence then;	999
	And you can witness with me this is true.	999
	999
DUKE OF SURREY	As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.	999
	999
LORD FITZWATER	Surrey, thou liest.	999
	999
DUKE OF SURREY	Dishonourable boy!	999
	That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,	999
	That it shall render vengeance and revenge	999
	Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie	999
	In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:	999
	In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;	999
	Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.	999
	999
LORD FITZWATER	How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!	999
	If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,	999
	I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,	999
	And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,	999
	And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,	999
	To tie thee to my strong correction.	999
	As I intend to thrive in this new world,	999
	Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:	999
	Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say	999
	That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men	999
	To execute the noble duke at Calais.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Some honest Christian trust me with a gage	999
	That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,	999
	If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	These differences shall all rest under gage	999
	Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,	999
	And, though mine enemy, restored again	999
	To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,	999
	Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.	999
	999
BISHOP OF CARLISLE	That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.	999
	Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought	999
	For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,	999
	Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross	999
	Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:	999
	And toil'd with works of war, retired himself	999
	To Italy; and there at Venice gave	999
	His body to that pleasant country's earth,	999
	And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,	999
	Under whose colours he had fought so long.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?	999
	999
BISHOP OF CARLISLE	As surely as I live, my lord.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom	999
	Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,	999
	Your differences shall all rest under gage	999
	Till we assign you to your days of trial.	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE OF YORK, attended]	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee	999
	From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul	999
	Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields	999
	To the possession of thy royal hand:	999
	Ascend his throne, descending now from him;	999
	And long live Henry, fourth of that name!	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.	999
	999
BISHOP OF CARLISLE	Marry. God forbid!	999
	Worst in this royal presence may I speak,	999
	Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.	999
	Would God that any in this noble presence	999
	Were enough noble to be upright judge	999
	Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would	999
	Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.	999
	What subject can give sentence on his king?	999
	And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?	999
	Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,	999
	Although apparent guilt be seen in them;	999
	And shall the figure of God's majesty,	999
	His captain, steward, deputy-elect,	999
	Anointed, crowned, planted many years,	999
	Be judged by subject and inferior breath,	999
	And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,	999
	That in a Christian climate souls refined	999
	Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!	999
	I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,	999
	Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:	999
	My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,	999
	Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:	999
	And if you crown him, let me prophesy:	999
	The blood of English shall manure the ground,	999
	And future ages groan for this foul act;	999
	Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,	999
	And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars	999
	Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;	999
	Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny	999
	Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd	999
	The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.	999
	O, if you raise this house against this house,	999
	It will the woefullest division prove	999
	That ever fell upon this cursed earth.	999
	Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,	999
	Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,	999
	Of capital treason we arrest you here.	999
	My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge	999
	To keep him safely till his day of trial.	999
	May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Fetch hither Richard, that in common view	999
	He may surrender; so we shall proceed	999
	Without suspicion.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	                  I will be his conduct.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Lords, you that here are under our arrest,	999
	Procure your sureties for your days of answer.	999
	Little are we beholding to your love,	999
	And little look'd for at your helping hands.	999
	999
	[Re-enter DUKE OF YORK, with KING RICHARD II, and	999
	Officers bearing the regalia]	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Alack, why am I sent for to a king,	999
	Before I have shook off the regal thoughts	999
	Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd	999
	To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:	999
	Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me	999
	To this submission. Yet I well remember	999
	The favours of these men: were they not mine?	999
	Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?	999
	So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,	999
	Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.	999
	God save the king! Will no man say amen?	999
	Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.	999
	God save the king! although I be not he;	999
	And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.	999
	To do what service am I sent for hither?	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	To do that office of thine own good will	999
	Which tired majesty did make thee offer,	999
	The resignation of thy state and crown	999
	To Henry Bolingbroke.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;	999
	Here cousin:	999
	On this side my hand, and on that side yours.	999
	Now is this golden crown like a deep well	999
	That owes two buckets, filling one another,	999
	The emptier ever dancing in the air,	999
	The other down, unseen and full of water:	999
	That bucket down and full of tears am I,	999
	Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I thought you had been willing to resign.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:	999
	You may my glories and my state depose,	999
	But not my griefs; still am I king of those.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Part of your cares you give me with your crown.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.	999
	My care is loss of care, by old care done;	999
	Your care is gain of care, by new care won:	999
	The cares I give I have, though given away;	999
	They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Are you contented to resign the crown?	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;	999
	Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.	999
	Now mark me, how I will undo myself;	999
	I give this heavy weight from off my head	999
	And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,	999
	The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;	999
	With mine own tears I wash away my balm,	999
	With mine own hands I give away my crown,	999
	With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,	999
	With mine own breath release all duty's rites:	999
	All pomp and majesty I do forswear;	999
	My manors, rents, revenues I forego;	999
	My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:	999
	God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!	999
	God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!	999
	Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,	999
	And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!	999
	Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,	999
	And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!	999
	God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,	999
	And send him many years of sunshine days!	999
	What more remains?	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	                  No more, but that you read	999
	These accusations and these grievous crimes	999
	Committed by your person and your followers	999
	Against the state and profit of this land;	999
	That, by confessing them, the souls of men	999
	May deem that you are worthily deposed.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Must I do so? and must I ravel out	999
	My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,	999
	If thy offences were upon record,	999
	Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop	999
	To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,	999
	There shouldst thou find one heinous article,	999
	Containing the deposing of a king	999
	And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,	999
	Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:	999
	Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,	999
	Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,	999
	Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands	999
	Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates	999
	Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,	999
	And water cannot wash away your sin.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:	999
	And yet salt water blinds them not so much	999
	But they can see a sort of traitors here.	999
	Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,	999
	I find myself a traitor with the rest;	999
	For I have given here my soul's consent	999
	To undeck the pompous body of a king;	999
	Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,	999
	Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord,--	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,	999
	Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,	999
	No, not that name was given me at the font,	999
	But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,	999
	That I have worn so many winters out,	999
	And know not now what name to call myself!	999
	O that I were a mockery king of snow,	999
	Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,	999
	To melt myself away in water-drops!	999
	Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,	999
	An if my word be sterling yet in England,	999
	Let it command a mirror hither straight,	999
	That it may show me what a face I have,	999
	Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.	999
	999
	[Exit an attendant]	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	The commons will not then be satisfied.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,	999
	When I do see the very book indeed	999
	Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Attendant, with a glass]	999
	999
	Give me the glass, and therein will I read.	999
	No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck	999
	So many blows upon this face of mine,	999
	And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,	999
	Like to my followers in prosperity,	999
	Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face	999
	That every day under his household roof	999
	Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face	999
	That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?	999
	Was this the face that faced so many follies,	999
	And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?	999
	A brittle glory shineth in this face:	999
	As brittle as the glory is the face;	999
	999
	[Dashes the glass against the ground]	999
	999
	For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.	999
	Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,	999
	How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd	999
	The shadow or your face.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Say that again.	999
	The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:	999
	'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;	999
	And these external manners of laments	999
	Are merely shadows to the unseen grief	999
	That swells with silence in the tortured soul;	999
	There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,	999
	For thy great bounty, that not only givest	999
	Me cause to wail but teachest me the way	999
	How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,	999
	And then be gone and trouble you no more.	999
	Shall I obtain it?	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	                  Name it, fair cousin.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:	999
	For when I was a king, my flatterers	999
	Were then but subjects; being now a subject,	999
	I have a king here to my flatterer.	999
	Being so great, I have no need to beg.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Yet ask.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	And shall I have?	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	You shall.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Then give me leave to go.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Whither?	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Whither you will, so I were from your sights.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,	999
	That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.	999
	999
	[Exeunt KING RICHARD II, some Lords, and a Guard]	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	On Wednesday next we solemnly set down	999
	Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all except the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the Abbot	999
	of Westminster, and DUKE OF AUMERLE]	999
	999
Abbot	A woeful pageant have we here beheld.	999
	999
BISHOP OF CARLISLE	The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.	999
	Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	You holy clergymen, is there no plot	999
	To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?	999
	999
Abbot	My lord,	999
	Before I freely speak my mind herein,	999
	You shall not only take the sacrament	999
	To bury mine intents, but also to effect	999
	Whatever I shall happen to devise.	999
	I see your brows are full of discontent,	999
	Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:	999
	Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay	999
	A plot shall show us all a merry day.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

	KING RICHARD II	999
	999
	999
ACT V	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE I	London. A street leading to the Tower.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter QUEEN and Ladies]	999
	999
QUEEN	This way the king will come; this is the way	999
	To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,	999
	To whose flint bosom my condemned lord	999
	Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:	999
	Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth	999
	Have any resting for her true king's queen.	999
	999
	[Enter KING RICHARD II and Guard]	999
	999
	But soft, but see, or rather do not see,	999
	My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,	999
	That you in pity may dissolve to dew,	999
	And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.	999
	Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,	999
	Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,	999
	And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,	999
	Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,	999
	When triumph is become an alehouse guest?	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,	999
	To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,	999
	To think our former state a happy dream;	999
	From which awaked, the truth of what we are	999
	Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,	999
	To grim Necessity, and he and I	999
	Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France	999
	And cloister thee in some religious house:	999
	Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,	999
	Which our profane hours here have stricken down.	999
	999
QUEEN	What, is my Richard both in shape and mind	999
	Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed	999
	Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?	999
	The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,	999
	And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage	999
	To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,	999
	Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,	999
	And fawn on rage with base humility,	999
	Which art a lion and a king of beasts?	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,	999
	I had been still a happy king of men.	999
	Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:	999
	Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,	999
	As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.	999
	In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire	999
	With good old folks and let them tell thee tales	999
	Of woeful ages long ago betid;	999
	And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,	999
	Tell thou the lamentable tale of me	999
	And send the hearers weeping to their beds:	999
	For why, the senseless brands will sympathize	999
	The heavy accent of thy moving tongue	999
	And in compassion weep the fire out;	999
	And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,	999
	For the deposing of a rightful king.	999
	999
	[Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others]	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:	999
	You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.	999
	And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;	999
	With all swift speed you must away to France.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal	999
	The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,	999
	The time shall not be many hours of age	999
	More than it is ere foul sin gathering head	999
	Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,	999
	Though he divide the realm and give thee half,	999
	It is too little, helping him to all;	999
	And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way	999
	To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,	999
	Being ne'er so little urged, another way	999
	To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.	999
	The love of wicked men converts to fear;	999
	That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both	999
	To worthy danger and deserved death.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	My guilt be on my head, and there an end.	999
	Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate	999
	A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,	999
	And then betwixt me and my married wife.	999
	Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;	999
	And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.	999
	Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,	999
	Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;	999
	My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,	999
	She came adorned hither like sweet May,	999
	Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.	999
	999
QUEEN	And must we be divided? must we part?	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.	999
	999
QUEEN	Banish us both and send the king with me.	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	That were some love but little policy.	999
	999
QUEEN	Then whither he goes, thither let me go.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	So two, together weeping, make one woe.	999
	Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;	999
	Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.	999
	Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.	999
	999
QUEEN	So longest way shall have the longest moans.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,	999
	And piece the way out with a heavy heart.	999
	Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,	999
	Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;	999
	One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;	999
	Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.	999
	999
QUEEN	Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part	999
	To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.	999
	So, now I have mine own again, be gone,	999
	That I might strive to kill it with a groan.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	We make woe wanton with this fond delay:	999
	Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.	999

SCENE II	The DUKE OF YORK's palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE OF YORK and DUCHESS OF YORK]	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,	999
	When weeping made you break the story off,	999
	of our two cousins coming into London.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Where did I leave?	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	                  At that sad stop, my lord,	999
	Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops	999
	Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,	999
	Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed	999
	Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,	999
	With slow but stately pace kept on his course,	999
	Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,	999
	Bolingbroke!'	999
	You would have thought the very windows spake,	999
	So many greedy looks of young and old	999
	Through casements darted their desiring eyes	999
	Upon his visage, and that all the walls	999
	With painted imagery had said at once	999
	'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'	999
	Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,	999
	Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,	999
	Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'	999
	And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	As in a theatre, the eyes of men,	999
	After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,	999
	Are idly bent on him that enters next,	999
	Thinking his prattle to be tedious;	999
	Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes	999
	Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'	999
	No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:	999
	But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:	999
	Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,	999
	His face still combating with tears and smiles,	999
	The badges of his grief and patience,	999
	That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd	999
	The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted	999
	And barbarism itself have pitied him.	999
	But heaven hath a hand in these events,	999
	To whose high will we bound our calm contents.	999
	To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,	999
	Whose state and honour I for aye allow.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Here comes my son Aumerle.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Aumerle that was;	999
	But that is lost for being Richard's friend,	999
	And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:	999
	I am in parliament pledge for his truth	999
	And lasting fealty to the new-made king.	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE]	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Welcome, my son: who are the violets now	999
	That strew the green lap of the new come spring?	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:	999
	God knows I had as lief be none as one.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,	999
	Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.	999
	What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	For aught I know, my lord, they do.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	You will be there, I know.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	If God prevent not, I purpose so.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?	999
	Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	My lord, 'tis nothing.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	No matter, then, who see it;	999
	I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	I do beseech your grace to pardon me:	999
	It is a matter of small consequence,	999
	Which for some reasons I would not have seen.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.	999
	I fear, I fear,--	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	                  What should you fear?	999
	'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into	999
	For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond	999
	That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.	999
	Boy, let me see the writing.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.	999
	999
	[He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it]	999
	999
	Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	What is the matter, my lord?	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Ho! who is within there?	999
	999
	[Enter a Servant]	999
	999
		    Saddle my horse.	999
	God for his mercy, what treachery is here!	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Why, what is it, my lord?	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.	999
	Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,	999
	I will appeach the villain.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	What is the matter?	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Peace, foolish woman.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Good mother, be content; it is no more	999
	Than my poor life must answer.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Thy life answer!	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Servant with boots]	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.	999
	Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Give me my boots, I say.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Why, York, what wilt thou do?	999
	Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?	999
	Have we more sons? or are we like to have?	999
	Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?	999
	And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,	999
	And rob me of a happy mother's name?	999
	Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Thou fond mad woman,	999
	Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?	999
	A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,	999
	And interchangeably set down their hands,	999
	To kill the king at Oxford.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	He shall be none;	999
	We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,	999
	I would appeach him.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Hadst thou groan'd for him	999
	As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.	999
	But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect	999
	That I have been disloyal to thy bed,	999
	And that he is a bastard, not thy son:	999
	Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:	999
	He is as like thee as a man may be,	999
	Not like to me, or any of my kin,	999
	And yet I love him.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Make way, unruly woman!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;	999
	Spur post, and get before him to the king,	999
	And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.	999
	I'll not be long behind; though I be old,	999
	I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:	999
	And never will I rise up from the ground	999
	Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!	999

SCENE III	A royal palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, HENRY PERCY, and other Lords]	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?	999
	'Tis full three months since I did see him last;	999
	If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.	999
	I would to God, my lords, he might be found:	999
	Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,	999
	For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,	999
	With unrestrained loose companions,	999
	Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,	999
	And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;	999
	Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,	999
	Takes on the point of honour to support	999
	So dissolute a crew.	999
	999
HENRY PERCY	My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,	999
	And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	And what said the gallant?	999
	999
HENRY PERCY	His answer was, he would unto the stews,	999
	And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,	999
	And wear it as a favour; and with that	999
	He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	As dissolute as desperate; yet through both	999
	I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years	999
	May happily bring forth. But who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE]	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Where is the king?	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	What means our cousin, that he stares and looks	999
	So wildly?	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,	999
	To have some conference with your grace alone.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.	999
	999
	[Exeunt HENRY PERCY and Lords]	999
	999
	What is the matter with our cousin now?	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	For ever may my knees grow to the earth,	999
	My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth	999
	Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Intended or committed was this fault?	999
	If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,	999
	To win thy after-love I pardon thee.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Then give me leave that I may turn the key,	999
	That no man enter till my tale be done.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Have thy desire.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	[Within]  My liege, beware; look to thyself;	999
	Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Villain, I'll make thee safe.	999
	999
	[Drawing]	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	[Within]  Open the door, secure, foolhardy king:	999
	Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?	999
	Open the door, or I will break it open.	999
	999
	[Enter DUKE OF YORK]	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	What is the matter, uncle? speak;	999
	Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,	999
	That we may arm us to encounter it.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know	999
	The treason that my haste forbids me show.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:	999
	I do repent me; read not my name there	999
	My heart is not confederate with my hand.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.	999
	I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;	999
	Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:	999
	Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove	999
	A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!	999
	O loyal father of a treacherous son!	999
	Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,	999
	From when this stream through muddy passages	999
	Hath held his current and defiled himself!	999
	Thy overflow of good converts to bad,	999
	And thy abundant goodness shall excuse	999
	This deadly blot in thy digressing son.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;	999
	And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,	999
	As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.	999
	Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,	999
	Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:	999
	Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,	999
	The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	[Within]  What ho, my liege! for God's sake,	999
	let me in.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.	999
	Speak with me, pity me, open the door.	999
	A beggar begs that never begg'd before.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,	999
	And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'	999
	My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:	999
	I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,	999
	More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.	999
	This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;	999
	This let alone will all the rest confound.	999
	999
	[Enter DUCHESS OF YORK]	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!	999
	Love loving not itself none other can.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?	999
	Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.	999
	999
	[Kneels]	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Rise up, good aunt.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Not yet, I thee beseech:	999
	For ever will I walk upon my knees,	999
	And never see day that the happy sees,	999
	Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,	999
	By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.	999
	999
DUKE OF AUMERLE	Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Against them both my true joints bended be.	999
	Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;	999
	His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;	999
	His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:	999
	He prays but faintly and would be denied;	999
	We pray with heart and soul and all beside:	999
	His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;	999
	Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:	999
	His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;	999
	Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.	999
	Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have	999
	That mercy which true prayer ought to have.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Good aunt, stand up.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'	999
	Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'	999
	And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,	999
	'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.	999
	I never long'd to hear a word till now;	999
	Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:	999
	The word is short, but not so short as sweet;	999
	No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.	999
	999
DUKE OF YORK	Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?	999
	Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,	999
	That set'st the word itself against the word!	999
	Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;	999
	The chopping French we do not understand.	999
	Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;	999
	Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;	999
	That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,	999
	Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Good aunt, stand up.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	I do not sue to stand;	999
	Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!	999
	Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;	999
	Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,	999
	But makes one pardon strong.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	With all my heart	999
	I pardon him.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	                  A god on earth thou art.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,	999
	With all the rest of that consorted crew,	999
	Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.	999
	Good uncle, help to order several powers	999
	To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:	999
	They shall not live within this world, I swear,	999
	But I will have them, if I once know where.	999
	Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:	999
	Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.	999

	999
Servant	                  These were his very words.	999

	999
Servant	He did.	999

SCENE V	Pomfret castle.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter KING RICHARD]	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	I have been studying how I may compare	999
	This prison where I live unto the world:	999
	And for because the world is populous	999
	And here is not a creature but myself,	999
	I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.	999
	My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,	999
	My soul the father; and these two beget	999
	A generation of still-breeding thoughts,	999
	And these same thoughts people this little world,	999
	In humours like the people of this world,	999
	For no thought is contented. The better sort,	999
	As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd	999
	With scruples and do set the word itself	999
	Against the word:	999
	As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,	999
	'It is as hard to come as for a camel	999
	To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'	999
	Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot	999
	Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails	999
	May tear a passage through the flinty ribs	999
	Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,	999
	And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.	999
	Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves	999
	That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,	999
	Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars	999
	Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,	999
	That many have and others must sit there;	999
	And in this thought they find a kind of ease,	999
	Bearing their own misfortunes on the back	999
	Of such as have before endured the like.	999
	Thus play I in one person many people,	999
	And none contented: sometimes am I king;	999
	Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,	999
	And so I am: then crushing penury	999
	Persuades me I was better when a king;	999
	Then am I king'd again: and by and by	999
	Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,	999
	And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,	999
	Nor I nor any man that but man is	999
	With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased	999
	With being nothing. Music do I hear?	999
	999
	[Music]	999
	999
	Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,	999
	When time is broke and no proportion kept!	999
	So is it in the music of men's lives.	999
	And here have I the daintiness of ear	999
	To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;	999
	But for the concord of my state and time	999
	Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.	999
	I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;	999
	For now hath time made me his numbering clock:	999
	My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar	999
	Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,	999
	Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,	999
	Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.	999
	Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is	999
	Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,	999
	Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans	999
	Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time	999
	Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,	999
	While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.	999
	This music mads me; let it sound no more;	999
	For though it have holp madmen to their wits,	999
	In me it seems it will make wise men mad.	999
	Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!	999
	For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard	999
	Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.	999
	999
	[Enter a Groom of the Stable]	999
	999
Groom	Hail, royal prince!	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Thanks, noble peer;	999
	The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.	999
	What art thou? and how comest thou hither,	999
	Where no man never comes but that sad dog	999
	That brings me food to make misfortune live?	999
	999
Groom	I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,	999
	When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,	999
	With much ado at length have gotten leave	999
	To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.	999
	O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld	999
	In London streets, that coronation-day,	999
	When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,	999
	That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,	999
	That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,	999
	How went he under him?	999
	999
Groom	So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!	999
	That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;	999
	This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.	999
	Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,	999
	Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck	999
	Of that proud man that did usurp his back?	999
	Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,	999
	Since thou, created to be awed by man,	999
	Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;	999
	And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,	999
	Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.	999
	999
	[Enter Keeper, with a dish]	999
	999
Keeper	Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.	999
	999
Groom	What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
Keeper	My lord, will't please you to fall to?	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.	999
	999
Keeper	My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who	999
	lately came from the king, commands the contrary.	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!	999
	Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.	999
	999
	[Beats the keeper]	999
	999
Keeper	Help, help, help!	999
	999
	[Enter EXTON and Servants, armed]	999
	999
KING RICHARD II	How now! what means death in this rude assault?	999
	Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.	999
	999
	[Snatching an axe from a Servant and killing him]	999
	999
	Go thou, and fill another room in hell.	999
	999
	[He kills another. Then Exton strikes him down]	999
	999
	That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire	999
	That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand	999
	Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.	999
	Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;	999
	Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.	999
	999
	[Dies]	999
	999
EXTON	As full of valour as of royal blood:	999
	Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!	999
	For now the devil, that told me I did well,	999
	Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.	999
	This dead king to the living king I'll bear	999
	Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.	999

	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear	999
	Is that the rebels have consumed with fire	999
	Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;	999
	But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.	999
	999
	[Enter NORTHUMBERLAND]	999
	999
	Welcome, my lord	what is the news?	999
	999
NORTHUMBERLAND	First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.	999
	The next news is, I have to London sent	999
	The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:	999
	The manner of their taking may appear	999
	At large discoursed in this paper here.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;	999
	And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.	999
	999
	[Enter LORD FITZWATER]	999
	999
LORD FITZWATER	My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London	999
	The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,	999
	Two of the dangerous consorted traitors	999
	That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;	999
	Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.	999
	999
	[Enter HENRY PERCY, and the BISHOP OF CARLISLE]	999
	999
HENRY PERCY	The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,	999
	With clog of conscience and sour melancholy	999
	Hath yielded up his body to the grave;	999
	But here is Carlisle living, to abide	999
	Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Carlisle, this is your doom:	999
	Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,	999
	More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;	999
	So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:	999
	For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,	999
	High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.	999
	999
	[Enter EXTON, with persons bearing a coffin]	999
	999
EXTON	Great king, within this coffin I present	999
	Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies	999
	The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,	999
	Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought	999
	A deed of slander with thy fatal hand	999
	Upon my head and all this famous land.	999
	999
EXTON	From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.	999
	999
HENRY BOLINGBROKE	They love not poison that do poison need,	999
	Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,	999
	I hate the murderer, love him murdered.	999
	The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,	999
	But neither my good word nor princely favour:	999
	With Cain go wander through shades of night,	999
	And never show thy head by day nor light.	999
	Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,	999
	That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:	999
	Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,	999
	And put on sullen black incontinent:	999
	I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,	999
	To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:	999
	March sadly after; grace my mournings here;	999
	In weeping after this untimely bier.	999

	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER, solus]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Now is the winter of our discontent	999
	Made glorious summer by this sun of York;	999
	And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house	999
	In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.	999
	Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;	999
	Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;	999
	Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,	999
	Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.	999
	Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;	999
	And now, instead of mounting barded steeds	999
	To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,	999
	He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber	999
	To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.	999
	But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,	999
	Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;	999
	I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty	999
	To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;	999
	I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,	999
	Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,	999
	Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time	999
	Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,	999
	And that so lamely and unfashionable	999
	That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;	999
	Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,	999
	Have no delight to pass away the time,	999
	Unless to spy my shadow in the sun	999
	And descant on mine own deformity:	999
	And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,	999
	To entertain these fair well-spoken days,	999
	I am determined to prove a villain	999
	And hate the idle pleasures of these days.	999
	Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,	999
	By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,	999
	To set my brother Clarence and the king	999
	In deadly hate the one against the other:	999
	And if King Edward be as true and just	999
	As I am subtle, false and treacherous,	999
	This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,	999
	About a prophecy, which says that 'G'	999
	Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.	999
	Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here	999
	Clarence comes.	999
	999
	[Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY]	999
	999
	Brother, good day; what means this armed guard	999
	That waits upon your grace?	999
	999
CLARENCE	His majesty	999
	Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed	999
	This conduct to convey me to the Tower.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Upon what cause?	999
	999
CLARENCE	                  Because my name is George.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;	999
	He should, for that, commit your godfathers:	999
	O, belike his majesty hath some intent	999
	That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.	999
	But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?	999
	999
CLARENCE	Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest	999
	As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,	999
	He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;	999
	And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.	999
	And says a wizard told him that by G	999
	His issue disinherited should be;	999
	And, for my name of George begins with G,	999
	It follows in his thought that I am he.	999
	These, as I learn, and such like toys as these	999
	Have moved his highness to commit me now.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:	999
	'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:	999
	My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she	999
	That tempers him to this extremity.	999
	Was it not she and that good man of worship,	999
	Anthony Woodville, her brother there,	999
	That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,	999
	From whence this present day he is deliver'd?	999
	We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.	999
	999
CLARENCE	By heaven, I think there's no man is secure	999
	But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds	999
	That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.	999
	Heard ye not what an humble suppliant	999
	Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Humbly complaining to her deity	999
	Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.	999
	I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,	999
	If we will keep in favour with the king,	999
	To be her men and wear her livery:	999
	The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,	999
	Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.	999
	Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	I beseech your graces both to pardon me;	999
	His majesty hath straitly given in charge	999
	That no man shall have private conference,	999
	Of what degree soever, with his brother.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,	999
	You may partake of any thing we say:	999
	We speak no treason, man: we say the king	999
	Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen	999
	Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;	999
	We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,	999
	A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;	999
	And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:	999
	How say you sir? Can you deny all this?	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,	999
	He that doth naught with her, excepting one,	999
	Were best he do it secretly, alone.	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	What one, my lord?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal	999
	Forbear your conference with the noble duke.	999
	999
CLARENCE	We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.	999
	Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;	999
	And whatsoever you will employ me in,	999
	Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,	999
	I will perform it to enfranchise you.	999
	Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood	999
	Touches me deeper than you can imagine.	999
	999
CLARENCE	I know it pleaseth neither of us well.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;	999
	Meantime, have patience.	999
	999
CLARENCE	I must perforce. Farewell.	999
	999
	[Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.	999
	Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,	999
	That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,	999
	If heaven will take the present at our hands.	999
	But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?	999
	999
	[Enter HASTINGS]	999
	999
HASTINGS	Good time of day unto my gracious lord!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	As much unto my good lord chamberlain!	999
	Well are you welcome to the open air.	999
	How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?	999
	999
HASTINGS	With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:	999
	But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks	999
	That were the cause of my imprisonment.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;	999
	For they that were your enemies are his,	999
	And have prevail'd as much on him as you.	999
	999
HASTINGS	More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,	999
	While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What news abroad?	999
	999
HASTINGS	No news so bad abroad as this at home;	999
	The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,	999
	And his physicians fear him mightily.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.	999
	O, he hath kept an evil diet long,	999
	And overmuch consumed his royal person:	999
	'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.	999
	What, is he in his bed?	999
	999
HASTINGS	He is.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Go you before, and I will follow you.	999
	999
	[Exit HASTINGS]	999
	999
	He cannot live, I hope; and must not die	999
	Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.	999
	I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,	999
	With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;	999
	And, if I fall not in my deep intent,	999
	Clarence hath not another day to live:	999
	Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,	999
	And leave the world for me to bustle in!	999
	For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.	999
	What though I kill'd her husband and her father?	999
	The readiest way to make the wench amends	999
	Is to become her husband and her father:	999
	The which will I; not all so much for love	999
	As for another secret close intent,	999
	By marrying her which I must reach unto.	999
	But yet I run before my horse to market:	999
	Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:	999
	When they are gone, then must I count my gains.	999

	KING RICHARD III	999

	999
ACT I	999

	999
	999
SCENE II	The same. Another street.	999
	999
	[Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen	999
	with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner]	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Set down, set down your honourable load,	999
	If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,	999
	Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament	999
	The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.	999
	Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!	999
	Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!	999
	Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!	999
	Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,	999
	To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,	999
	Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,	999
	Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!	999
	Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,	999
	I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.	999
	Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!	999
	Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!	999
	Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!	999
	More direful hap betide that hated wretch,	999
	That makes us wretched by the death of thee,	999
	Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,	999
	Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!	999
	If ever he have child, abortive be it,	999
	Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,	999
	Whose ugly and unnatural aspect	999
	May fright the hopeful mother at the view;	999
	And that be heir to his unhappiness!	999
	If ever he have wife, let her he made	999
	A miserable by the death of him	999
	As I am made by my poor lord and thee!	999
	Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,	999
	Taken from Paul's to be interred there;	999
	And still, as you are weary of the weight,	999
	Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	What black magician conjures up this fiend,	999
	To stop devoted charitable deeds?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,	999
	I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.	999
	999
Gentleman	My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:	999
	Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,	999
	Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,	999
	And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?	999
	Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,	999
	And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.	999
	Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!	999
	Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,	999
	His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;	999
	For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,	999
	Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.	999
	If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,	999
	Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.	999
	O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds	999
	Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!	999
	Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;	999
	For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood	999
	From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;	999
	Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,	999
	Provokes this deluge most unnatural.	999
	O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!	999
	O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!	999
	Either heaven with lightning strike the	999
	murderer dead,	999
	Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,	999
	As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood	999
	Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Lady, you know no rules of charity,	999
	Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:	999
	No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	But I know none, and therefore am no beast.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	More wonderful, when angels are so angry.	999
	Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,	999
	Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,	999
	By circumstance, but to acquit myself.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,	999
	For these known evils, but to give me leave,	999
	By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have	999
	Some patient leisure to excuse myself.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make	999
	No excuse current, but to hang thyself.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	By such despair, I should accuse myself.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;	999
	For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,	999
	Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Say that I slew them not?	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Why, then they are not dead:	999
	But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I did not kill your husband.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Why, then he is alive.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw	999
	Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;	999
	The which thou once didst bend against her breast,	999
	But that thy brothers beat aside the point.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,	999
	which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.	999
	Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:	999
	Didst thou not kill this king?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I grant ye.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too	999
	Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!	999
	O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;	999
	For he was fitter for that place than earth.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	And thou unfit for any place but hell.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Some dungeon.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	                             Your bed-chamber.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	So will it, madam till I lie with you.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	I hope so.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,	999
	To leave this keen encounter of our wits,	999
	And fall somewhat into a slower method,	999
	Is not the causer of the timeless deaths	999
	Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,	999
	As blameful as the executioner?	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Your beauty was the cause of that effect;	999
	Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep	999
	To undertake the death of all the world,	999
	So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,	999
	These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;	999
	You should not blemish it, if I stood by:	999
	As all the world is cheered by the sun,	999
	So I by that; it is my day, my life.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	I would I were, to be revenged on thee.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	It is a quarrel most unnatural,	999
	To be revenged on him that loveth you.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	It is a quarrel just and reasonable,	999
	To be revenged on him that slew my husband.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,	999
	Did it to help thee to a better husband.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	His better doth not breathe upon the earth.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He lives that loves thee better than he could.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Name him.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	        Plantagenet.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Why, that was he.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	The selfsame name, but one of better nature.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Where is he?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	                 Here.	999
	999
	[She spitteth at him]	999
	999
	Why dost thou spit at me?	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Never came poison from so sweet a place.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Never hung poison on a fouler toad.	999
	Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I would they were, that I might die at once;	999
	For now they kill me with a living death.	999
	Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,	999
	Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:	999
	These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,	999
	No, when my father York and Edward wept,	999
	To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made	999
	When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;	999
	Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,	999
	Told the sad story of my father's death,	999
	And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,	999
	That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks	999
	Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time	999
	My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;	999
	And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,	999
	Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.	999
	I never sued to friend nor enemy;	999
	My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;	999
	But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,	999
	My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.	999
	999
	[She looks scornfully at him]	999
	999
	Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made	999
	For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.	999
	If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,	999
	Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;	999
	Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.	999
	And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,	999
	I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,	999
	And humbly beg the death upon my knee.	999
	999
	[He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword]	999
	999
	Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,	999
	But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.	999
	Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,	999
	But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.	999
	999
	[Here she lets fall the sword]	999
	999
	Take up the sword again, or take up me.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,	999
	I will not be the executioner.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	I have already.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	                  Tush, that was in thy rage:	999
	Speak it again, and, even with the word,	999
	That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,	999
	Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;	999
	To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	I would I knew thy heart.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	'Tis figured in my tongue.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	I fear me both are false.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Then never man was true.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Well, well, put up your sword.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Say, then, my peace is made.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	That shall you know hereafter.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	But shall I live in hope?	999
	999
LADY ANNE	All men, I hope, live so.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Vouchsafe to wear this ring.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	To take is not to give.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.	999
	Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;	999
	Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.	999
	And if thy poor devoted suppliant may	999
	But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,	999
	Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	What is it?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	That it would please thee leave these sad designs	999
	To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,	999
	And presently repair to Crosby Place;	999
	Where, after I have solemnly interr'd	999
	At Chertsey monastery this noble king,	999
	And wet his grave with my repentant tears,	999
	I will with all expedient duty see you:	999
	For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,	999
	Grant me this boon.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	With all my heart; and much it joys me too,	999
	To see you are become so penitent.	999
	Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Bid me farewell.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	'Tis more than you deserve;	999
	But since you teach me how to flatter you,	999
	Imagine I have said farewell already.	999
	999
	[Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Sirs, take up the corse.	999
	999
GENTLEMEN	Towards Chertsey, noble lord?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
	Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?	999
	Was ever woman in this humour won?	999
	I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.	999
	What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,	999
	To take her in her heart's extremest hate,	999
	With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,	999
	The bleeding witness of her hatred by;	999
	Having God, her conscience, and these bars	999
	against me,	999
	And I nothing to back my suit at all,	999
	But the plain devil and dissembling looks,	999
	And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!	999
	Ha!	999
	Hath she forgot already that brave prince,	999
	Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,	999
	Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?	999
	A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,	999
	Framed in the prodigality of nature,	999
	Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,	999
	The spacious world cannot again afford	999
	And will she yet debase her eyes on me,	999
	That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,	999
	And made her widow to a woful bed?	999
	On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?	999
	On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?	999
	My dukedom to a beggarly denier,	999
	I do mistake my person all this while:	999
	Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,	999
	Myself to be a marvellous proper man.	999
	I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,	999
	And entertain some score or two of tailors,	999
	To study fashions to adorn my body:	999
	Since I am crept in favour with myself,	999
	Will maintain it with some little cost.	999
	But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;	999
	And then return lamenting to my love.	999
	Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,	999
	That I may see my shadow as I pass.	999

ACT I	999

	999
	999
SCENE III	The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY]	999
	999
RIVERS	Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty	999
	Will soon recover his accustom'd health.	999
	999
GREY	In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:	999
	Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,	999
	And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	If he were dead, what would betide of me?	999
	999
RIVERS	No other harm but loss of such a lord.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	The loss of such a lord includes all harm.	999
	999
GREY	The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,	999
	To be your comforter when he is gone.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Oh, he is young and his minority	999
	Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,	999
	A man that loves not me, nor none of you.	999
	999
RIVERS	Is it concluded that he shall be protector?	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	It is determined, not concluded yet:	999
	But so it must be, if the king miscarry.	999
	999
	[Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY]	999
	999
GREY	Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Good time of day unto your royal grace!	999
	999
DERBY	God make your majesty joyful as you have been!	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.	999
	To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.	999
	Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,	999
	And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured	999
	I hate not you for her proud arrogance.	999
	999
DERBY	I do beseech you, either not believe	999
	The envious slanders of her false accusers;	999
	Or, if she be accused in true report,	999
	Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds	999
	From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.	999
	999
RIVERS	Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?	999
	999
DERBY	But now the Duke of Buckingham and I	999
	Are come from visiting his majesty.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	What likelihood of his amendment, lords?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	God grant him health! Did you confer with him?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement	999
	Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,	999
	And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;	999
	And sent to warn them to his royal presence.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Would all were well! but that will never be	999
	I fear our happiness is at the highest.	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:	999
	Who are they that complain unto the king,	999
	That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?	999
	By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly	999
	That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.	999
	Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,	999
	Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,	999
	Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,	999
	I must be held a rancorous enemy.	999
	Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,	999
	But thus his simple truth must be abused	999
	By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?	999
	999
RIVERS	To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.	999
	When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?	999
	Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?	999
	A plague upon you all! His royal person,--	999
	Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--	999
	Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,	999
	But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.	999
	The king, of his own royal disposition,	999
	And not provoked by any suitor else;	999
	Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,	999
	Which in your outward actions shows itself	999
	Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,	999
	Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather	999
	The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,	999
	That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:	999
	Since every Jack became a gentleman	999
	There's many a gentle person made a Jack.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Come, come, we know your meaning, brother	999
	Gloucester;	999
	You envy my advancement and my friends':	999
	God grant we never may have need of you!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:	999
	Your brother is imprison'd by your means,	999
	Myself disgraced, and the nobility	999
	Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions	999
	Are daily given to ennoble those	999
	That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	By Him that raised me to this careful height	999
	From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,	999
	I never did incense his majesty	999
	Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been	999
	An earnest advocate to plead for him.	999
	My lord, you do me shameful injury,	999
	Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	You may deny that you were not the cause	999
	Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.	999
	999
RIVERS	She may, my lord, for--	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?	999
	She may do more, sir, than denying that:	999
	She may help you to many fair preferments,	999
	And then deny her aiding hand therein,	999
	And lay those honours on your high deserts.	999
	What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--	999
	999
RIVERS	What, marry, may she?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What, marry, may she! marry with a king,	999
	A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:	999
	I wis your grandam had a worser match.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne	999
	Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:	999
	By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty	999
	With those gross taunts I often have endured.	999
	I had rather be a country servant-maid	999
	Than a great queen, with this condition,	999
	To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:	999
	999
	[Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind]	999
	999
	Small joy have I in being England's queen.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!	999
	Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What! threat you me with telling of the king?	999
	Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said	999
	I will avouch in presence of the king:	999
	I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.	999
	'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Out, devil! I remember them too well:	999
	Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,	999
	And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,	999
	I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;	999
	A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,	999
	A liberal rewarder of his friends:	999
	To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	In all which time you and your husband Grey	999
	Were factious for the house of Lancaster;	999
	And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband	999
	In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?	999
	Let me put in your minds, if you forget,	999
	What you have been ere now, and what you are;	999
	Withal, what I have been, and what I am.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	A murderous villain, and so still thou art.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;	999
	Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Which God revenge!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	To fight on Edward's party for the crown;	999
	And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.	999
	I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;	999
	Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine	999
	I am too childish-foolish for this world.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,	999
	Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.	999
	999
RIVERS	My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days	999
	Which here you urge to prove us enemies,	999
	We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:	999
	So should we you, if you should be our king.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:	999
	Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	As little joy, my lord, as you suppose	999
	You should enjoy, were you this country's king,	999
	As little joy may you suppose in me.	999
	That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;	999
	For I am she, and altogether joyless.	999
	I can no longer hold me patient.	999
	999
	[Advancing]	999
	999
	Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out	999
	In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!	999
	Which of you trembles not that looks on me?	999
	If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,	999
	Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?	999
	O gentle villain, do not turn away!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;	999
	That will I make before I let thee go.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Wert thou not banished on pain of death?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	I was; but I do find more pain in banishment	999
	Than death can yield me here by my abode.	999
	A husband and a son thou owest to me;	999
	And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:	999
	The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,	999
	And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	The curse my noble father laid on thee,	999
	When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper	999
	And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,	999
	And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout	999
	Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--	999
	His curses, then from bitterness of soul	999
	Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;	999
	And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	So just is God, to right the innocent.	999
	999
HASTINGS	O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,	999
	And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!	999
	999
RIVERS	Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.	999
	999
DORSET	No man but prophesied revenge for it.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	What were you snarling all before I came,	999
	Ready to catch each other by the throat,	999
	And turn you all your hatred now on me?	999
	Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?	999
	That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,	999
	Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,	999
	Could all but answer for that peevish brat?	999
	Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?	999
	Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!	999
	If not by war, by surfeit die your king,	999
	As ours by murder, to make him a king!	999
	Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,	999
	For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,	999
	Die in his youth by like untimely violence!	999
	Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,	999
	Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!	999
	Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;	999
	And see another, as I see thee now,	999
	Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!	999
	Long die thy happy days before thy death;	999
	And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,	999
	Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!	999
	Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,	999
	And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son	999
	Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,	999
	That none of you may live your natural age,	999
	But by some unlook'd accident cut off!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.	999
	If heaven have any grievous plague in store	999
	Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,	999
	O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,	999
	And then hurl down their indignation	999
	On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!	999
	The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!	999
	Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,	999
	And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!	999
	No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,	999
	Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream	999
	Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!	999
	Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!	999
	Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity	999
	The slave of nature and the son of hell!	999
	Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!	999
	Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!	999
	Thou rag of honour! thou detested--	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Margaret.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	        Richard!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	                  Ha!	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	                  I call thee not.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought	999
	That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.	999
	O, let me make the period to my curse!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!	999
	Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,	999
	Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?	999
	Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.	999
	The time will come when thou shalt wish for me	999
	To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.	999
	999
HASTINGS	False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,	999
	Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.	999
	999
RIVERS	Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	To serve me well, you all should do me duty,	999
	Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:	999
	O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!	999
	999
DORSET	Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:	999
	Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.	999
	O, that your young nobility could judge	999
	What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!	999
	They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;	999
	And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.	999
	999
DORSET	It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,	999
	Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,	999
	And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!	999
	Witness my son, now in the shade of death;	999
	Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath	999
	Hath in eternal darkness folded up.	999
	Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.	999
	O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!	999
	As it was won with blood, lost be it so!	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Have done! for shame, if not for charity.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Urge neither charity nor shame to me:	999
	Uncharitably with me have you dealt,	999
	And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.	999
	My charity is outrage, life my shame	999
	And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Have done, have done.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,	999
	In sign of league and amity with thee:	999
	Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!	999
	Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,	999
	Nor thou within the compass of my curse.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Nor no one here; for curses never pass	999
	The lips of those that breathe them in the air.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,	999
	And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.	999
	O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!	999
	Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,	999
	His venom tooth will rankle to the death:	999
	Have not to do with him, beware of him;	999
	Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,	999
	And all their ministers attend on him.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?	999
	And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?	999
	O, but remember this another day,	999
	When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,	999
	And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!	999
	Live each of you the subjects to his hate,	999
	And he to yours, and all of you to God's!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
HASTINGS	My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.	999
	999
RIVERS	And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,	999
	She hath had too much wrong; and I repent	999
	My part thereof that I have done to her.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	I never did her any, to my knowledge.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	But you have all the vantage of her wrong.	999
	I was too hot to do somebody good,	999
	That is too cold in thinking of it now.	999
	Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,	999
	He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains	999
	God pardon them that are the cause of it!	999
	999
RIVERS	A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,	999
	To pray for them that have done scathe to us.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	So do I ever:	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	being well-advised.	999
	For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.	999
	999
	[Enter CATESBY]	999
	999
CATESBY	Madam, his majesty doth call for you,	999
	And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?	999
	999
RIVERS	Madam, we will attend your grace.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.	999
	The secret mischiefs that I set abroach	999
	I lay unto the grievous charge of others.	999
	Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,	999
	I do beweep to many simple gulls	999
	Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;	999
	And say it is the queen and her allies	999
	That stir the king against the duke my brother.	999
	Now, they believe it; and withal whet me	999
	To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:	999
	But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,	999
	Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:	999
	And thus I clothe my naked villany	999
	With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;	999
	And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.	999
	999
	[Enter two Murderers]	999
	999
	But, soft! here come my executioners.	999
	How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!	999
	Are you now going to dispatch this deed?	999
	999
First Murderer	We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant	999
	That we may be admitted where he is.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Well thought upon; I have it here about me.	999
	999
	[Gives the warrant]	999
	999
	When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.	999
	But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,	999
	Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;	999
	For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps	999
	May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.	999
	999
First Murderer	Tush!	999
	Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;	999
	Talkers are no good doers: be assured	999
	We come to use our hands and not our tongues.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:	999
	I like you, lads; about your business straight;	999
	Go, go, dispatch.	999
	999
First Murderer	                  We will, my noble lord.	999

ACT I	999

	999
	999
SCENE IV	London. The Tower.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY]	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	Why looks your grace so heavily today?	999
	999
CLARENCE	O, I have pass'd a miserable night,	999
	So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,	999
	That, as I am a Christian faithful man,	999
	I would not spend another such a night,	999
	Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,	999
	So full of dismal terror was the time!	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,	999
	And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;	999
	And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;	999
	Who from my cabin tempted me to walk	999
	Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,	999
	And cited up a thousand fearful times,	999
	During the wars of York and Lancaster	999
	That had befall'n us. As we paced along	999
	Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,	999
	Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,	999
	Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,	999
	Into the tumbling billows of the main.	999
	Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!	999
	What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!	999
	What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!	999
	Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;	999
	Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;	999
	Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,	999
	Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,	999
	All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:	999
	Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes	999
	Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,	999
	As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,	999
	Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,	999
	And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	Had you such leisure in the time of death	999
	To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?	999
	999
CLARENCE	Methought I had; and often did I strive	999
	To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood	999
	Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth	999
	To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;	999
	But smother'd it within my panting bulk,	999
	Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	Awaked you not with this sore agony?	999
	999
CLARENCE	O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;	999
	O, then began the tempest to my soul,	999
	Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,	999
	With that grim ferryman which poets write of,	999
	Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.	999
	The first that there did greet my stranger soul,	999
	Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;	999
	Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury	999
	Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'	999
	And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by	999
	A shadow like an angel, with bright hair	999
	Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,	999
	'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,	999
	That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;	999
	Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'	999
	With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends	999
	Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears	999
	Such hideous cries, that with the very noise	999
	I trembling waked, and for a season after	999
	Could not believe but that I was in hell,	999
	Such terrible impression made the dream.	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;	999
	I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.	999
	999
CLARENCE	O Brakenbury, I have done those things,	999
	Which now bear evidence against my soul,	999
	For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!	999
	O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,	999
	But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,	999
	Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,	999
	O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!	999
	I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;	999
	My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!	999
	999
	[CLARENCE sleeps]	999
	999
	Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,	999
	Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.	999
	Princes have but their tides for their glories,	999
	An outward honour for an inward toil;	999
	And, for unfelt imagination,	999
	They often feel a world of restless cares:	999
	So that, betwixt their tides and low names,	999
	There's nothing differs but the outward fame.	999
	999
	[Enter the two Murderers]	999
	999
First Murderer	Ho! who's here?	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?	999
	999
First Murderer	I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	Yea, are you so brief?	999
	999
Second Murderer	O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show	999
	him our commission; talk no more.	999
	999
	[BRAKENBURY reads it]	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	I am, in this, commanded to deliver	999
	The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:	999
	I will not reason what is meant hereby,	999
	Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.	999
	Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:	999
	I'll to the king; and signify to him	999
	That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.	999
	999
First Murderer	Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.	999
	999
	[Exit BRAKENBURY]	999
	999
Second Murderer	What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?	999
	999
First Murderer	No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.	999
	999
Second Murderer	When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till	999
	the judgment-day.	999
	999
First Murderer	Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.	999
	999
Second Murderer	The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind	999
	of remorse in me.	999
	999
First Murderer	What, art thou afraid?	999
	999
Second Murderer	Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be	999
	damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.	999
	999
First Murderer	I thought thou hadst been resolute.	999
	999
Second Murderer	So I am, to let him live.	999
	999
First Murderer	Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.	999
	999
Second Murderer	I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour	999
	will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one	999
	would tell twenty.	999
	999
First Murderer	How dost thou feel thyself now?	999
	999
Second Murderer	'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet	999
	within me.	999
	999
First Murderer	Remember our reward, when the deed is done.	999
	999
Second Murderer	'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.	999
	999
First Murderer	Where is thy conscience now?	999
	999
Second Murderer	In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.	999
	999
First Murderer	So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,	999
	thy conscience flies out.	999
	999
Second Murderer	Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.	999
	999
First Murderer	How if it come to thee again?	999
	999
Second Murderer	I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it	999
	makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it	999
	accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;	999
	he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it	999
	detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that	999
	mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of	999
	obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold	999
	that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it	999
	is turned out of all towns and cities for a	999
	dangerous thing; and every man that means to live	999
	well endeavours to trust to himself and to live	999
	without it.	999
	999
First Murderer	'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me	999
	not to kill the duke.	999
	999
Second Murderer	Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he	999
	would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.	999
	999
First Murderer	Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,	999
	I warrant thee.	999
	999
Second Murderer	Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his	999
	reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?	999
	999
First Murderer	Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy	999
	sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt	999
	in the next room.	999
	999
Second Murderer	O excellent devise! make a sop of him.	999
	999
First Murderer	Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?	999
	999
Second Murderer	No, first let's reason with him.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.	999
	999
Second murderer	You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.	999
	999
CLARENCE	In God's name, what art thou?	999
	999
Second Murderer	A man, as you are.	999
	999
CLARENCE	But not, as I am, royal.	999
	999
Second Murderer	Nor you, as we are, loyal.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.	999
	999
Second Murderer	My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.	999
	999
CLARENCE	How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!	999
	Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?	999
	Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?	999
	999
Both	To, to, to--	999
	999
CLARENCE	To murder me?	999
	999
Both	Ay, ay.	999
	999
CLARENCE	You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,	999
	And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.	999
	Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?	999
	999
First Murderer	Offended us you have not, but the king.	999
	999
CLARENCE	I shall be reconciled to him again.	999
	999
Second Murderer	Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Are you call'd forth from out a world of men	999
	To slay the innocent? What is my offence?	999
	Where are the evidence that do accuse me?	999
	What lawful quest have given their verdict up	999
	Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced	999
	The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?	999
	Before I be convict by course of law,	999
	To threaten me with death is most unlawful.	999
	I charge you, as you hope to have redemption	999
	By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,	999
	That you depart and lay no hands on me	999
	The deed you undertake is damnable.	999
	999
First Murderer	What we will do, we do upon command.	999
	999
Second Murderer	And he that hath commanded is the king.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings	999
	Hath in the tables of his law commanded	999
	That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,	999
	Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?	999
	Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,	999
	To hurl upon their heads that break his law.	999
	999
Second Murderer	And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,	999
	For false forswearing and for murder too:	999
	Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,	999
	To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.	999
	999
First Murderer	And, like a traitor to the name of God,	999
	Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade	999
	Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.	999
	999
Second Murderer	Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.	999
	999
First Murderer	How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,	999
	When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?	999
	999
CLARENCE	Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?	999
	For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,	999
	He sends ye not to murder me for this	999
	For in this sin he is as deep as I.	999
	If God will be revenged for this deed.	999
	O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,	999
	Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;	999
	He needs no indirect nor lawless course	999
	To cut off those that have offended him.	999
	999
First Murderer	Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,	999
	When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,	999
	That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?	999
	999
CLARENCE	My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.	999
	999
First Murderer	Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,	999
	Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;	999
	I am his brother, and I love him well.	999
	If you be hired for meed, go back again,	999
	And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,	999
	Who shall reward you better for my life	999
	Than Edward will for tidings of my death.	999
	999
Second Murderer	You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.	999
	999
CLARENCE	O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:	999
	Go you to him from me.	999
	999
Both	Ay, so we will.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Tell him, when that our princely father York	999
	Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,	999
	And charged us from his soul to love each other,	999
	He little thought of this divided friendship:	999
	Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.	999
	999
First Murderer	Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.	999
	999
CLARENCE	O, do not slander him, for he is kind.	999
	999
First Murderer	Right,	999
	As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:	999
	'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.	999
	999
CLARENCE	It cannot be; for when I parted with him,	999
	He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,	999
	That he would labour my delivery.	999
	999
Second Murderer	Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee	999
	From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.	999
	999
First Murderer	Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,	999
	To counsel me to make my peace with God,	999
	And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,	999
	That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?	999
	Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on	999
	To do this deed will hate you for the deed.	999
	999
Second Murderer	What shall we do?	999
	999
CLARENCE	                  Relent, and save your souls.	999
	999
First Murderer	Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.	999
	999
CLARENCE	Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.	999
	Which of you, if you were a prince's son,	999
	Being pent from liberty, as I am now,	999
	if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,	999
	Would not entreat for life?	999
	My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:	999
	O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,	999
	Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,	999
	As you would beg, were you in my distress	999
	A begging prince what beggar pities not?	999
	999
Second Murderer	Look behind you, my lord.	999
	999
First Murderer	Take that, and that: if all this will not do,	999
	999
	[Stabs him]	999
	999
	I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.	999
	999
	[Exit, with the body]	999
	999
Second Murderer	A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!	999
	How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands	999
	Of this most grievous guilty murder done!	999
	999
	[Re-enter First Murderer]	999
	999
First Murderer	How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?	999
	By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!	999
	999
Second Murderer	I would he knew that I had saved his brother!	999
	Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;	999
	For I repent me that the duke is slain.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
First Murderer	So do not I: go, coward as thou art.	999
	Now must I hide his body in some hole,	999
	Until the duke take order for his burial:	999
	And when I have my meed, I must away;	999
	For this will out, and here I must not stay.	999

	999
SCENE I	London. The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV sick, QUEEN	999
	ELIZABETH, DORSET, RIVERS, HASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM,	999
	GREY, and others]	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:	999
	You peers, continue this united league:	999
	I every day expect an embassage	999
	From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;	999
	And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,	999
	Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.	999
	Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;	999
	Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.	999
	999
RIVERS	By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:	999
	And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.	999
	999
HASTINGS	So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Take heed you dally not before your king;	999
	Lest he that is the supreme King of kings	999
	Confound your hidden falsehood, and award	999
	Either of you to be the other's end.	999
	999
HASTINGS	So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!	999
	999
RIVERS	And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,	999
	Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;	999
	You have been factious one against the other,	999
	Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;	999
	And what you do, do it unfeignedly.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Here, Hastings; I will never more remember	999
	Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.	999
	999
DORSET	This interchange of love, I here protest,	999
	Upon my part shall be unviolable.	999
	999
HASTINGS	And so swear I, my lord	999
	999
	[They embrace]	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league	999
	With thy embracements to my wife's allies,	999
	And make me happy in your unity.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate	999
	On you or yours,	999
	999
	[To the Queen]	999
	999
	but with all duteous love	999
	Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me	999
	With hate in those where I expect most love!	999
	When I have most need to employ a friend,	999
	And most assured that he is a friend	999
	Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,	999
	Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,	999
	When I am cold in zeal to yours.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,	999
	is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.	999
	There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,	999
	To make the perfect period of this peace.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:	999
	And, princely peers, a happy time of day!	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.	999
	Brother, we done deeds of charity;	999
	Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,	999
	Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:	999
	Amongst this princely heap, if any here,	999
	By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,	999
	Hold me a foe;	999
	If I unwittingly, or in my rage,	999
	Have aught committed that is hardly borne	999
	By any in this presence, I desire	999
	To reconcile me to his friendly peace:	999
	'Tis death to me to be at enmity;	999
	I hate it, and desire all good men's love.	999
	First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,	999
	Which I will purchase with my duteous service;	999
	Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,	999
	If ever any grudge were lodged between us;	999
	Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;	999
	That without desert have frown'd on me;	999
	Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.	999
	I do not know that Englishman alive	999
	With whom my soul is any jot at odds	999
	More than the infant that is born to-night	999
	I thank my God for my humility.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:	999
	I would to God all strifes were well compounded.	999
	My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty	999
	To take our brother Clarence to your grace.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this	999
	To be so bouted in this royal presence?	999
	Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?	999
	999
	[They all start]	999
	999
	You do him injury to scorn his corse.	999
	999
RIVERS	Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	All seeing heaven, what a world is this!	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?	999
	999
DORSET	Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence	999
	But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	But he, poor soul, by your first order died,	999
	And that a winged Mercury did bear:	999
	Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,	999
	That came too lag to see him buried.	999
	God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,	999
	Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,	999
	Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,	999
	And yet go current from suspicion!	999
	999
	[Enter DERBY]	999
	999
DORSET	A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.	999
	999
DORSET	I will not rise, unless your highness grant.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.	999
	999
DORSET	The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;	999
	Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman	999
	Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.	999
	999
KING EDWARD IV	Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,	999
	And shall the same give pardon to a slave?	999
	My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,	999
	And yet his punishment was cruel death.	999
	Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,	999
	Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised	999
	Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?	999
	Who told me how the poor soul did forsake	999
	The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?	999
	Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury	999
	When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,	999
	And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?	999
	Who told me, when we both lay in the field	999
	Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me	999
	Even in his own garments, and gave himself,	999
	All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?	999
	All this from my remembrance brutish wrath	999
	Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you	999
	Had so much grace to put it in my mind.	999
	But when your carters or your waiting-vassals	999
	Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced	999
	The precious image of our dear Redeemer,	999
	You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;	999
	And I unjustly too, must grant it you	999
	But for my brother not a man would speak,	999
	Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself	999
	For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all	999
	Have been beholding to him in his life;	999
	Yet none of you would once plead for his life.	999
	O God, I fear thy justice will take hold	999
	On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!	999
	Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.	999
	Oh, poor Clarence!	999
	999
	[Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN MARGARET]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not	999
	How that the guilty kindred of the queen	999
	Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?	999
	O, they did urge it still unto the king!	999
	God will revenge it. But come, let us in,	999
	To comfort Edward with our company.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	We wait upon your grace.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

SCENE II	The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter the DUCHESS OF YORK, with the two children of CLARENCE]	999
	999
Boy	Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	No, boy.	999
	999
Boy	Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,	999
	And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'	999
	999
Girl	Why do you look on us, and shake your head,	999
	And call us wretches, orphans, castaways	999
	If that our noble father be alive?	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;	999
	I do lament the sickness of the king.	999
	As loath to lose him, not your father's death;	999
	It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.	999
	999
Boy	Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.	999
	The king my uncle is to blame for this:	999
	God will revenge it; whom I will importune	999
	With daily prayers all to that effect.	999
	999
Girl	And so will I.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:	999
	Incapable and shallow innocents,	999
	You cannot guess who caused your father's death.	999
	999
Boy	Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester	999
	Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,	999
	Devised impeachments to imprison him :	999
	And when my uncle told me so, he wept,	999
	And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;	999
	Bade me rely on him as on my father,	999
	And he would love me dearly as his child.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,	999
	And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!	999
	He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;	999
	Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.	999
	999
Boy	Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Ay, boy.	999
	999
Boy	I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?	999
	999
	[Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her	999
	ears; RIVERS, and DORSET after her]	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,	999
	To chide my fortune, and torment myself?	999
	I'll join with black despair against my soul,	999
	And to myself become an enemy.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	What means this scene of rude impatience?	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	To make an act of tragic violence:	999
	Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.	999
	Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?	999
	Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?	999
	If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,	999
	That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;	999
	Or, like obedient subjects, follow him	999
	To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow	999
	As I had title in thy noble husband!	999
	I have bewept a worthy husband's death,	999
	And lived by looking on his images:	999
	But now two mirrors of his princely semblance	999
	Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,	999
	And I for comfort have but one false glass,	999
	Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.	999
	Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,	999
	And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:	999
	But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,	999
	And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,	999
	Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,	999
	Thine being but a moiety of my grief,	999
	To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!	999
	999
Boy	Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;	999
	How can we aid you with our kindred tears?	999
	999
Girl	Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;	999
	Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Give me no help in lamentation;	999
	I am not barren to bring forth complaints	999
	All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,	999
	That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,	999
	May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!	999
	Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!	999
	999
Children	Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.	999
	999
Children	What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	What stays had I but they? and they are gone.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Was never widow had so dear a loss!	999
	999
Children	Were never orphans had so dear a loss!	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Was never mother had so dear a loss!	999
	Alas, I am the mother of these moans!	999
	Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.	999
	She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;	999
	I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:	999
	These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;	999
	I for an Edward weep, so do not they:	999
	Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,	999
	Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,	999
	And I will pamper it with lamentations.	999
	999
DORSET	Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased	999
	That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:	999
	In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,	999
	With dull unwilligness to repay a debt	999
	Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;	999
	Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,	999
	For it requires the royal debt it lent you.	999
	999
RIVERS	Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,	999
	Of the young prince your son: send straight for him	999
	Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:	999
	Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,	999
	And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause	999
	To wail the dimming of our shining star;	999
	But none can cure their harms by wailing them.	999
	Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;	999
	I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee	999
	I crave your blessing.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,	999
	Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  Amen; and make me die a good old man!	999
	That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:	999
	I marvel why her grace did leave it out.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,	999
	That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,	999
	Now cheer each other in each other's love	999
	Though we have spent our harvest of this king,	999
	We are to reap the harvest of his son.	999
	The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,	999
	But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,	999
	Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:	999
	Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,	999
	Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd	999
	Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.	999
	999
RIVERS	Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,	999
	The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,	999
	Which would be so much the more dangerous	999
	By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:	999
	Where every horse bears his commanding rein,	999
	And may direct his course as please himself,	999
	As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,	999
	In my opinion, ought to be prevented.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I hope the king made peace with all of us	999
	And the compact is firm and true in me.	999
	999
RIVERS	And so in me; and so, I think, in all:	999
	Yet, since it is but green, it should be put	999
	To no apparent likelihood of breach,	999
	Which haply by much company might be urged:	999
	Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,	999
	That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.	999
	999
HASTINGS	And so say I.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Then be it so; and go we to determine	999
	Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.	999
	Madam, and you, my mother, will you go	999
	To give your censures in this weighty business?	999
	999

	999
BUCKINGHAM	My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,	999
	For God's sake, let not us two be behind;	999
	For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,	999
	As index to the story we late talk'd of,	999
	To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	My other self, my counsel's consistory,	999
	My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,	999
	I, like a child, will go by thy direction.	999
	Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.	999

	[Enter two Citizens meeting]	999
	999
First Citizen	Neighbour, well met: whither away so fast?	999
	999
Second Citizen	I promise you, I scarcely know myself:	999
	Hear you the news abroad?	999
	999
First Citizen	Ay, that the king is dead.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:	999
	I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.	999
	999
	[Enter another Citizen]	999
	999
Third Citizen	Neighbours, God speed!	999
	999
First Citizen	Give you good morrow, sir.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?	999
	999
Second Citizen	Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!	999
	999
Third Citizen	Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.	999
	999
First Citizen	No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!	999
	999
Second Citizen	In him there is a hope of government,	999
	That in his nonage council under him,	999
	And in his full and ripen'd years himself,	999
	No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.	999
	999
First Citizen	So stood the state when Henry the Sixth	999
	Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;	999
	For then this land was famously enrich'd	999
	With politic grave counsel; then the king	999
	Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.	999
	999
First Citizen	Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Better it were they all came by the father,	999
	Or by the father there were none at all;	999
	For emulation now, who shall be nearest,	999
	Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.	999
	O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!	999
	And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:	999
	And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,	999
	This sickly land might solace as before.	999
	999
First Citizen	Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.	999
	999
Third Citizen	When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;	999
	When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;	999
	When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?	999
	Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.	999
	All may be well; but, if God sort it so,	999
	'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.	999
	999
Second Citizen	Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:	999
	Ye cannot reason almost with a man	999
	That looks not heavily and full of fear.	999
	999
Third Citizen	Before the times of change, still is it so:	999
	By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust	999
	Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see	999
	The waters swell before a boisterous storm.	999
	But leave it all to God. whither away?	999
	999
Second Citizen	Marry, we were sent for to the justices.	999
	999
Third Citizen	And so was I: I'll bear you company.	999

	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, young YORK, QUEEN	999
	ELIZABETH, and the DUCHESS OF YORK]	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;	999
	At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:	999
	To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	I long with all my heart to see the prince:	999
	I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	But I hear, no; they say my son of York	999
	Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.	999
	999
YORK	Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.	999
	999
YORK	Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,	999
	My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow	999
	More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle	999
	Gloucester,	999
	'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'	999
	And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,	999
	Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold	999
	In him that did object the same to thee;	999
	He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,	999
	So long a-growing and so leisurely,	999
	That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.	999
	999
YORK	Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,	999
	I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,	999
	To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.	999
	999
YORK	Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast	999
	That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old	999
	'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.	999
	Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?	999
	999
YORK	Grandam, his nurse.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.	999
	999
YORK	If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Good madam, be not angry with the child.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Pitchers have ears.	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Here comes a messenger. What news?	999
	999
Messenger	Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	How fares the prince?	999
	999
Messenger	Well, madam, and in health.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	What is thy news then?	999
	999
Messenger	Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,	999
	With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Who hath committed them?	999
	999
Messenger	The mighty dukes	999
	Gloucester and Buckingham.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	For what offence?	999
	999
Messenger	The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;	999
	Why or for what these nobles were committed	999
	Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!	999
	The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;	999
	Insulting tyranny begins to jet	999
	Upon the innocent and aweless throne:	999
	Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!	999
	I see, as in a map, the end of all.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,	999
	How many of you have mine eyes beheld!	999
	My husband lost his life to get the crown;	999
	And often up and down my sons were toss'd,	999
	For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:	999
	And being seated, and domestic broils	999
	Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.	999
	Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,	999
	Self against self: O, preposterous	999
	And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;	999
	Or let me die, to look on death no more!	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.	999
	Madam, farewell.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	                  I'll go along with you.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	You have no cause.	999

ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	                  My gracious lady, go;	999
	And thither bear your treasure and your goods.	999
	For my part, I'll resign unto your grace	999
	The seal I keep: and so betide to me	999
	As well I tender you and all of yours!	999
	Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.	999

	999
BUCKINGHAM	Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign	999
	The weary way hath made you melancholy.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	No, uncle; but our crosses on the way	999
	Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy	999
	I want more uncles here to welcome me.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years	999
	Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit	999
	Nor more can you distinguish of a man	999
	Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,	999
	Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.	999
	Those uncles which you want were dangerous;	999
	Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,	999
	But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :	999
	God keep you from them, and from such false friends!	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	God keep me from false friends! but they were none.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.	999
	999
	[Enter the Lord Mayor and his train]	999
	999
Lord Mayor	God bless your grace with health and happy days!	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.	999
	I thought my mother, and my brother York,	999
	Would long ere this have met us on the way	999
	Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not	999
	To tell us whether they will come or no!	999
	999
	[Enter HASTINGS]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?	999
	999
HASTINGS	On what occasion, God he knows, not I,	999
	The queen your mother, and your brother York,	999
	Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince	999
	Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,	999
	But by his mother was perforce withheld.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Fie, what an indirect and peevish course	999
	Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace	999
	Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York	999
	Unto his princely brother presently?	999
	If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,	999
	And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.	999
	999
CARDINAL	My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory	999
	Can from his mother win the Duke of York,	999
	Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate	999
	To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid	999
	We should infringe the holy privilege	999
	Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land	999
	Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,	999
	Too ceremonious and traditional	999
	Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,	999
	You break not sanctuary in seizing him.	999
	The benefit thereof is always granted	999
	To those whose dealings have deserved the place,	999
	And those who have the wit to claim the place:	999
	This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;	999
	And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:	999
	Then, taking him from thence that is not there,	999
	You break no privilege nor charter there.	999
	Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;	999
	But sanctuary children ne'er till now.	999
	999
CARDINAL	My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.	999
	Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?	999
	999
HASTINGS	I go, my lord.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.	999

	Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,	999
	Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Where it seems best unto your royal self.	999
	If I may counsel you, some day or two	999
	Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:	999
	Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit	999
	For your best health and recreation.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	I do not like the Tower, of any place.	999
	Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;	999
	Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	Is it upon record, or else reported	999
	Successively from age to age, he built it?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Upon record, my gracious lord.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	But say, my lord, it were not register'd,	999
	Methinks the truth should live from age to age,	999
	As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,	999
	Even to the general all-ending day.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never	999
	live long.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	What say you, uncle?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I say, without characters, fame lives long.	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,	999
	I moralize two meanings in one word.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	That Julius Caesar was a famous man;	999
	With what his valour did enrich his wit,	999
	His wit set down to make his valour live	999
	Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;	999
	For now he lives in fame, though not in life.	999
	I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	What, my gracious lord?	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	An if I live until I be a man,	999
	I'll win our ancient right in France again,	999
	Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward spring.	999
	999
	[Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?	999
	999
YORK	Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:	999
	Too late he died that might have kept that title,	999
	Which by his death hath lost much majesty.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?	999
	999
YORK	I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,	999
	You said that idle weeds are fast in growth	999
	The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He hath, my lord.	999
	999
YORK	                  And therefore is he idle?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.	999
	999
YORK	Then is he more beholding to you than I.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He may command me as my sovereign;	999
	But you have power in me as in a kinsman.	999
	999
YORK	I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	A beggar, brother?	999
	999
YORK	Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;	999
	And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.	999
	999
YORK	A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	A gentle cousin, were it light enough.	999
	999
YORK	O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;	999
	In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	It is too heavy for your grace to wear.	999
	999
YORK	I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What, would you have my weapon, little lord?	999
	999
YORK	I would, that I might thank you as you call me.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	How?	999
	999
YORK	Little.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:	999
	Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.	999
	999
YORK	You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:	999
	Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;	999
	Because that I am little, like an ape,	999
	He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!	999
	To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,	999
	He prettily and aptly taunts himself:	999
	So cunning and so young is wonderful.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	My lord, will't please you pass along?	999
	Myself and my good cousin Buckingham	999
	Will to your mother, to entreat of her	999
	To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.	999
	999
YORK	What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	My lord protector needs will have it so.	999
	999
YORK	I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Why, what should you fear?	999
	999
YORK	Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:	999
	My grandam told me he was murdered there.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	I fear no uncles dead.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Nor none that live, I hope.	999
	999
PRINCE EDWARD	An if they live, I hope I need not fear.	999
	But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,	999
	Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.	999
	999
	[A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM	999
	and CATESBY]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Think you, my lord, this little prating York	999
	Was not incensed by his subtle mother	999
	To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;	999
	Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable	999
	He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.	999
	Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend	999
	As closely to conceal what we impart:	999
	Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;	999
	What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter	999
	To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,	999
	For the instalment of this noble duke	999
	In the seat royal of this famous isle?	999
	999
CATESBY	He for his father's sake so loves the prince,	999
	That he will not be won to aught against him.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?	999
	999
CATESBY	He will do all in all as Hastings doth.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,	999
	And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,	999
	How doth he stand affected to our purpose;	999
	And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,	999
	To sit about the coronation.	999
	If thou dost find him tractable to us,	999
	Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:	999
	If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,	999
	Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,	999
	And give us notice of his inclination:	999
	For we to-morrow hold divided councils,	999
	Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,	999
	His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries	999
	To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;	999
	And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,	999
	Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.	999
	999
CATESBY	My good lords both, with all the heed I may.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?	999
	999
CATESBY	You shall, my lord.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.	999
	999
	[Exit CATESBY]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive	999
	Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:	999
	And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me	999
	The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables	999
	Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	And look to have it yielded with all willingness.	999
	Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards	999
	We may digest our complots in some form.	999

SCENE II	Before Lord Hastings' house.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
Messenger	What, ho! my lord!	999
	999
HASTINGS	[Within]  Who knocks at the door?	999
	999
Messenger	A messenger from the Lord Stanley.	999
	999
	[Enter HASTINGS]	999
	999
HASTINGS	What is't o'clock?	999
	999
Messenger	Upon the stroke of four.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?	999
	999
Messenger	So it should seem by that I have to say.	999
	First, he commends him to your noble lordship.	999
	999
HASTINGS	And then?	999
	999
Messenger	And then he sends you word	999
	He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:	999
	Besides, he says there are two councils held;	999
	And that may be determined at the one	999
	which may make you and him to rue at the other.	999
	Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,	999
	If presently you will take horse with him,	999
	And with all speed post with him toward the north,	999
	To shun the danger that his soul divines.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;	999
	Bid him not fear the separated councils	999
	His honour and myself are at the one,	999
	And at the other is my servant Catesby	999
	Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us	999
	Whereof I shall not have intelligence.	999
	Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:	999
	And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond	999
	To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers	999
	To fly the boar before the boar pursues,	999
	Were to incense the boar to follow us	999
	And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.	999
	Go, bid thy master rise and come to me	999
	And we will both together to the Tower,	999
	Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.	999
	999
Messenger	My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter CATESBY]	999
	999
CATESBY	Many good morrows to my noble lord!	999
	999
HASTINGS	Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring	999
	What news, what news, in this our tottering state?	999
	999
CATESBY	It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;	999
	And I believe twill never stand upright	999
	Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.	999
	999
HASTINGS	How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?	999
	999
CATESBY	Ay, my good lord.	999
	999
HASTINGS	I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders	999
	Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.	999
	But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?	999
	999
CATESBY	Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward	999
	Upon his party for the gain thereof:	999
	And thereupon he sends you this good news,	999
	That this same very day your enemies,	999
	The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,	999
	Because they have been still mine enemies:	999
	But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,	999
	To bar my master's heirs in true descent,	999
	God knows I will not do it, to the death.	999
	999
CATESBY	God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!	999
	999
HASTINGS	But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,	999
	That they who brought me in my master's hate	999
	I live to look upon their tragedy.	999
	I tell thee, Catesby--	999
	999
CATESBY	What, my lord?	999
	999
HASTINGS	Ere a fortnight make me elder,	999
	I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.	999
	999
CATESBY	'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,	999
	When men are unprepared and look not for it.	999
	999
HASTINGS	O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out	999
	With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do	999
	With some men else, who think themselves as safe	999
	As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear	999
	To princely Richard and to Buckingham.	999
	999
CATESBY	The princes both make high account of you;	999
	999
	[Aside]	999
	999
	For they account his head upon the bridge.	999
	999
HASTINGS	I know they do; and I have well deserved it.	999
	999
	[Enter STANLEY]	999
	999
	Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?	999
	Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?	999
	999
STANLEY	My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:	999
	You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,	999
	I do not like these several councils, I.	999
	999
HASTINGS	My lord,	999
	I hold my life as dear as you do yours;	999
	And never in my life, I do protest,	999
	Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:	999
	Think you, but that I know our state secure,	999
	I would be so triumphant as I am?	999
	999
STANLEY	The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,	999
	Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,	999
	And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;	999
	But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.	999
	This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:	999
	Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!	999
	What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?	999
	To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.	999
	999
LORD STANLEY	They, for their truth, might better wear their heads	999
	Than some that have accused them wear their hats.	999
	But come, my lord, let us away.	999
	999
	[Enter a Pursuivant]	999
	999
HASTINGS	Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.	999
	999
	[Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY]	999
	999
	How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?	999
	999
Pursuivant	The better that your lordship please to ask.	999
	999
HASTINGS	I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now	999
	Than when I met thee last where now we meet:	999
	Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,	999
	By the suggestion of the queen's allies;	999
	But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--	999
	This day those enemies are put to death,	999
	And I in better state than e'er I was.	999
	999
Pursuivant	God hold it, to your honour's good content!	999
	999
HASTINGS	Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.	999
	999
	[Throws him his purse]	999
	999
Pursuivant	God save your lordship!	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter a Priest]	999
	999
Priest	Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.	999
	999
HASTINGS	I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.	999
	I am in your debt for your last exercise;	999
	Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.	999
	999
	[He whispers in his ear]	999
	999
	[Enter BUCKINGHAM]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?	999
	Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;	999
	Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.	999
	999
HASTINGS	Good faith, and when I met this holy man,	999
	Those men you talk of came into my mind.	999
	What, go you toward the Tower?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay	999
	I shall return before your lordship thence.	999
	999
HASTINGS	'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	[Aside]  And supper too, although thou know'st it not.	999
	Come, will you go?	999
	999

RIVERS	Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:	999
	To-day shalt thou behold a subject die	999
	For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.	999
	999
GREY	God keep the prince from all the pack of you!	999
	A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!	999
	999
VAUGHAN	You live that shall cry woe for this after.	999
	999
RATCLIFF	Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.	999
	999
RIVERS	O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,	999
	Fatal and ominous to noble peers!	999
	Within the guilty closure of thy walls	999
	Richard the second here was hack'd to death;	999
	And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,	999
	We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.	999
	999
GREY	Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,	999
	For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.	999
	999
RIVERS	Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,	999
	Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God	999
	To hear her prayers for them, as now for us	999
	And for my sister and her princely sons,	999
	Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,	999
	Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.	999

	999
HASTINGS	My lords, at once: the cause why we are met	999
	Is, to determine of the coronation.	999
	In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Are all things fitting for that royal time?	999
	999
DERBY	It is, and wants but nomination.	999
	999
BISHOP OF ELY	To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?	999
	Who is most inward with the royal duke?	999
	999
BISHOP OF ELY	Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,	999
	But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,	999
	Than I of yours;	999
	Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.	999
	Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.	999
	999
HASTINGS	I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;	999
	But, for his purpose in the coronation.	999
	I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd	999
	His gracious pleasure any way therein:	999
	But you, my noble lords, may name the time;	999
	And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,	999
	Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.	999

	[Enter GLOUCESTER]	999

BISHOP OF ELY	Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.	999

	I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,	999

	Which by my presence might have been concluded.	999
	999

	I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.	999
	999

	As he will lose his head ere give consent	999
	His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,	999
	Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.	999
	999
	[Exit GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM following]	999
	999
DERBY	We have not yet set down this day of triumph.	999
	To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;	999
	For I myself am not so well provided	999
	As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BISHOP OF ELY]	999
	999
BISHOP OF ELY	Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these	999
	strawberries.	999
	999
HASTINGS	His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;	999
	There's some conceit or other likes him well,	999
	When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.	999
	I think there's never a man in Christendom	999
	That can less hide his love or hate than he;	999
	For by his face straight shall you know his heart.	999
	999
DERBY	What of his heart perceive you in his face	999
	By any likelihood he show'd to-day?	999
	999
HASTINGS	Marry, that with no man here he is offended;	999
	For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.	999
	999
DERBY	I pray God he be not, I say.	999
	999
	[Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I pray you all, tell me what they deserve	999
	That do conspire my death with devilish plots	999
	Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd	999
	Upon my body with their hellish charms?	999
	999
HASTINGS	The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,	999
	Makes me most forward in this noble presence	999
	To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be	999
	I say, my lord, they have deserved death.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:	999
	See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm	999
	Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:	999
	And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,	999
	Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,	999
	That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.	999
	999
HASTINGS	If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--	999
	Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:	999
	Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,	999
	I will not dine until I see the same.	999
	Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:	999
	The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but HASTINGS, RATCLIFF, and LOVEL]	999
	999
HASTINGS	Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;	999
	For I, too fond, might have prevented this.	999
	Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;	999
	But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:	999
	Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,	999
	And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,	999
	As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.	999
	O, now I want the priest that spake to me:	999
	I now repent I told the pursuivant	999
	As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,	999
	How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,	999
	And I myself secure in grace and favour.	999
	O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse	999
	Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!	999
	999
RATCLIFF	Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:	999
	Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.	999
	999
HASTINGS	O momentary grace of mortal men,	999
	Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!	999
	Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,	999
	Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,	999
	Ready, with every nod, to tumble down	999
	Into the fatal bowels of the deep.	999
	999
LOVEL	Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.	999
	999
HASTINGS	O bloody Richard! miserable England!	999
	I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee	999
	That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.	999
	Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.	999
	They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, in rotten armour,	999
	marvellous ill-favoured]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,	999
	Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,	999
	And then begin again, and stop again,	999
	As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;	999
	Speak and look back, and pry on every side,	999
	Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,	999
	Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks	999
	Are at my service, like enforced smiles;	999
	And both are ready in their offices,	999
	At any time, to grace my stratagems.	999
	But what, is Catesby gone?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.	999
	999
	[Enter the Lord Mayor and CATESBY]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Lord mayor,--	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Look to the drawbridge there!	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Hark! a drum.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Catesby, o'erlook the walls.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	God and our innocency defend and guard us!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.	999
	999
	[Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head]	999
	999
LOVEL	Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,	999
	The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.	999
	I took him for the plainest harmless creature	999
	That breathed upon this earth a Christian;	999
	Made him my book wherein my soul recorded	999
	The history of all her secret thoughts:	999
	So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,	999
	That, his apparent open guilt omitted,	999
	I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,	999
	He lived from all attainder of suspect.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor	999
	That ever lived.	999
	Would you imagine, or almost believe,	999
	Were't not that, by great preservation,	999
	We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor	999
	This day had plotted, in the council-house	999
	To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?	999
	999
Lord Mayor	What, had he so?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What, think You we are Turks or infidels?	999
	Or that we would, against the form of law,	999
	Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,	999
	But that the extreme peril of the case,	999
	The peace of England and our persons' safety,	999
	Enforced us to this execution?	999
	999
Lord Mayor	Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;	999
	And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,	999
	To warn false traitors from the like attempts.	999
	I never look'd for better at his hands,	999
	After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Yet had not we determined he should die,	999
	Until your lordship came to see his death;	999
	Which now the loving haste of these our friends,	999
	Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:	999
	Because, my lord, we would have had you heard	999
	The traitor speak, and timorously confess	999
	The manner and the purpose of his treason;	999
	That you might well have signified the same	999
	Unto the citizens, who haply may	999
	Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.	999
	999
Lord Mayor	But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,	999
	As well as I had seen and heard him speak	999
	And doubt you not, right noble princes both,	999
	But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens	999
	With all your just proceedings in this cause.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,	999
	To avoid the carping censures of the world.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	But since you come too late of our intents,	999
	Yet witness what you hear we did intend:	999
	And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.	999
	999
	[Exit Lord Mayor]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.	999
	The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:	999
	There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,	999
	Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:	999
	Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,	999
	Only for saying he would make his son	999
	Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,	999
	Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.	999
	Moreover, urge his hateful luxury	999
	And bestial appetite in change of lust;	999
	Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,	999
	Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,	999
	Without control, listed to make his prey.	999
	Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:	999
	Tell them, when that my mother went with child	999
	Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York	999
	My princely father then had wars in France	999
	And, by just computation of the time,	999
	Found that the issue was not his begot;	999
	Which well appeared in his lineaments,	999
	Being nothing like the noble duke my father:	999
	But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,	999
	Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator	999
	As if the golden fee for which I plead	999
	Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;	999
	Where you shall find me well accompanied	999
	With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	I go: and towards three or four o'clock	999
	Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.	999
	999
	[Exit BUCKINGHAM]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;	999
	999
	[To CATESBY]	999
	999
	Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both	999
	Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
	Now will I in, to take some privy order,	999
	To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;	999
	And to give notice, that no manner of person	999
	At any time have recourse unto the princes.	999

	999
	999
	[Enter a Scrivener, with a paper in his hand]	999
	999
Scrivener	This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;	999
	Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,	999
	That it may be this day read over in Paul's.	999
	And mark how well the sequel hangs together:	999
	Eleven hours I spent to write it over,	999
	For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;	999
	The precedent was full as long a-doing:	999
	And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,	999
	Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty	999
	Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,	999
	That seeth not this palpable device?	999
	Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?	999
	Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,	999

	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors]	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	How now, my lord, what say the citizens?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,	999
	The citizens are mum and speak not a word.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,	999
	And his contract by deputy in France;	999
	The insatiate greediness of his desires,	999
	And his enforcement of the city wives;	999
	His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,	999
	As being got, your father then in France,	999
	His resemblance, being not like the duke;	999
	Withal I did infer your lineaments,	999
	Being the right idea of your father,	999
	Both in your form and nobleness of mind;	999
	Laid open all your victories in Scotland,	999
	Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,	999
	Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:	999
	Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose	999
	Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse	999
	And when mine oratory grew to an end	999
	I bid them that did love their country's good	999
	Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Ah! and did they so?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	No, so God help me, they spake not a word;	999
	But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,	999
	Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.	999
	Which when I saw, I reprehended them;	999
	And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:	999
	His answer was, the people were not wont	999
	To be spoke to but by the recorder.	999
	Then he was urged to tell my tale again,	999
	'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'	999
	But nothing spake in warrant from himself.	999
	When he had done, some followers of mine own,	999
	At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,	999
	And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'	999
	And thus I took the vantage of those few,	999
	'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;	999
	'This general applause and loving shout	999
	Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'	999
	And even here brake off, and came away.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	No, by my troth, my lord.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;	999
	Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:	999
	And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,	999
	And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;	999
	For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:	999
	And be not easily won to our request:	999
	Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I go; and if you plead as well for them	999
	As I can say nay to thee for myself,	999
	No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.	999
	999
	[Exit GLOUCESTER]	999
	999
	[Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens]	999
	999
	Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;	999
	I think the duke will not be spoke withal.	999
	999
	[Enter CATESBY]	999
	999
	Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,	999
	What says he?	999
	999
CATESBY	             My lord: he doth entreat your grace;	999
	To visit him to-morrow or next day:	999
	He is within, with two right reverend fathers,	999
	Divinely bent to meditation;	999
	And no worldly suit would he be moved,	999
	To draw him from his holy exercise.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;	999
	Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,	999
	In deep designs and matters of great moment,	999
	No less importing than our general good,	999
	Are come to have some conference with his grace.	999
	999
CATESBY	I'll tell him what you say, my lord.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!	999
	He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,	999
	But on his knees at meditation;	999
	Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,	999
	But meditating with two deep divines;	999
	Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,	999
	But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:	999
	Happy were England, would this gracious prince	999
	Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:	999
	But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.	999
	999
Lord Mayor	Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	I fear he will.	999
	999
	[Re-enter CATESBY]	999
	999
	How now, Catesby, what says your lord?	999
	999
CATESBY	My lord,	999
	He wonders to what end you have assembled	999
	Such troops of citizens to speak with him,	999
	His grace not being warn'd thereof before:	999
	My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Sorry I am my noble cousin should	999
	Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:	999
	By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;	999
	And so once more return and tell his grace.	999
	999
	[Exit CATESBY]	999
	999
	When holy and devout religious men	999
	Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,	999
	So sweet is zealous contemplation.	999
	999
	[Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops.	999
	CATESBY returns]	999
	999
Lord Mayor	See, where he stands between two clergymen!	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,	999
	To stay him from the fall of vanity:	999
	And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,	999
	True ornaments to know a holy man.	999
	Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,	999
	Lend favourable ears to our request;	999
	And pardon us the interruption	999
	Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	My lord, there needs no such apology:	999
	I rather do beseech you pardon me,	999
	Who, earnest in the service of my God,	999
	Neglect the visitation of my friends.	999
	But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,	999
	And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I do suspect I have done some offence	999
	That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,	999
	And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,	999
	At our entreaties, to amend that fault!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Then know, it is your fault that you resign	999
	The supreme seat, the throne majestical,	999
	The scepter'd office of your ancestors,	999
	Your state of fortune and your due of birth,	999
	The lineal glory of your royal house,	999
	To the corruption of a blemished stock:	999
	Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,	999
	Which here we waken to our country's good,	999
	This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;	999
	Her face defaced with scars of infamy,	999
	Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,	999
	And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf	999
	Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.	999
	Which to recure, we heartily solicit	999
	Your gracious self to take on you the charge	999
	And kingly government of this your land,	999
	Not as protector, steward, substitute,	999
	Or lowly factor for another's gain;	999
	But as successively from blood to blood,	999
	Your right of birth, your empery, your own.	999
	For this, consorted with the citizens,	999
	Your very worshipful and loving friends,	999
	And by their vehement instigation,	999
	In this just suit come I to move your grace.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	I know not whether to depart in silence,	999
	Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.	999
	Best fitteth my degree or your condition	999
	If not to answer, you might haply think	999
	Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded	999
	To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,	999
	Which fondly you would here impose on me;	999
	If to reprove you for this suit of yours,	999
	So season'd with your faithful love to me.	999
	Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.	999
	Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,	999
	And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,	999
	Definitively thus I answer you.	999
	Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert	999
	Unmeritable shuns your high request.	999
	First if all obstacles were cut away,	999
	And that my path were even to the crown,	999
	As my ripe revenue and due by birth	999
	Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,	999
	So mighty and so many my defects,	999
	As I had rather hide me from my greatness,	999
	Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,	999
	Than in my greatness covet to be hid,	999
	And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.	999
	But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,	999
	And much I need to help you, if need were;	999
	The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,	999
	Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,	999
	Will well become the seat of majesty,	999
	And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.	999
	On him I lay what you would lay on me,	999
	The right and fortune of his happy stars;	999
	Which God defend that I should wring from him!	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;	999
	But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,	999
	All circumstances well considered.	999
	You say that Edward is your brother's son:	999
	So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;	999
	For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--	999
	Your mother lives a witness to that vow--	999
	And afterward by substitute betroth'd	999
	To Bona, sister to the King of France.	999
	These both put by a poor petitioner,	999
	A care-crazed mother of a many children,	999
	A beauty-waning and distressed widow,	999
	Even in the afternoon of her best days,	999
	Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,	999
	Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts	999
	To base declension and loathed bigamy	999
	By her, in his unlawful bed, he got	999
	This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.	999
	More bitterly could I expostulate,	999
	Save that, for reverence to some alive,	999
	I give a sparing limit to my tongue.	999
	Then, good my lord, take to your royal self	999
	This proffer'd benefit of dignity;	999
	If non to bless us and the land withal,	999
	Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry	999
	From the corruption of abusing times,	999
	Unto a lineal true-derived course.	999
	999
Lord Mayor	Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.	999
	999
CATESBY	O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?	999
	I am unfit for state and majesty;	999
	I do beseech you, take it not amiss;	999
	I cannot nor I will not yield to you.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,	999
	Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;	999
	As well we know your tenderness of heart	999
	And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,	999
	Which we have noted in you to your kin,	999
	And egally indeed to all estates,--	999
	Yet whether you accept our suit or no,	999
	Your brother's son shall never reign our king;	999
	But we will plant some other in the throne,	999
	To the disgrace and downfall of your house:	999
	And in this resolution here we leave you.--	999
	Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.	999
	999
	[Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens]	999
	999
CATESBY	Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.	999
	999
ANOTHER	Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Would you enforce me to a world of care?	999
	Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,	999
	But penetrable to your. kind entreats,	999
	Albeit against my conscience and my soul.	999
	999
	[Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest]	999
	999
	Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,	999
	Since you will buckle fortune on my back,	999
	To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,	999
	I must have patience to endure the load:	999
	But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach	999
	Attend the sequel of your imposition,	999
	Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me	999
	From all the impure blots and stains thereof;	999
	For God he knows, and you may partly see,	999
	How far I am from the desire thereof.	999
	999
Lord Mayor	God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	In saying so, you shall but say the truth.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Then I salute you with this kingly title:	999
	Long live Richard, England's royal king!	999
	999
	999
Lord Mayor	|	999
	|  Amen.	999
Citizens	|	999
	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Even when you please, since you will have it so.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:	999
	And so most joyfully we take our leave.	999
	999
GLOUCESTER	Come, let us to our holy task again.	999
	Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.	999

	999
	999
SCENE I	Before the Tower.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter, on one side, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS OF	999
	YORK, and DORSET; on the other, ANNE, Duchess of	999
	Gloucester, leading Lady Margaret Plantagenet,	999
	CLARENCE's young Daughter]	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet	999
	Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?	999
	Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,	999
	On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.	999
	Daughter, well met.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	God give your graces both	999
	A happy and a joyful time of day!	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	As much to you, good sister! Whither away?	999
	999
LADY ANNE	No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,	999
	Upon the like devotion as yourselves,	999
	To gratulate the gentle princes there.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.	999
	999
	[Enter BRAKENBURY]	999
	999
	And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.	999
	Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,	999
	How doth the prince, and my young son of York?	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	Right well, dear madam. By your patience,	999
	I may not suffer you to visit them;	999
	The king hath straitly charged the contrary.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	The king! why, who's that?	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	The Lord protect him from that kingly title!	999
	Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?	999
	I am their mother; who should keep me from them?	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	I am their fathers mother; I will see them.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:	999
	Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame	999
	And take thy office from thee, on my peril.	999
	999
BRAKENBURY	No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:	999
	I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Enter LORD STANLEY]	999
	999
LORD STANLEY	Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,	999
	And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,	999
	And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.	999
	999
	[To LADY ANNE]	999
	999
	Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,	999
	There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart	999
	May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon	999
	With this dead-killing news!	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!	999
	999
DORSET	Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!	999
	Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;	999
	Thy mother's name is ominous to children.	999
	If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,	999
	And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell	999
	Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,	999
	Lest thou increase the number of the dead;	999
	And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,	999
	Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.	999
	999
LORD STANLEY	Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.	999
	Take all the swift advantage of the hours;	999
	You shall have letters from me to my son	999
	To meet you on the way, and welcome you.	999
	Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	O ill-dispersing wind of misery!	999
	O my accursed womb, the bed of death!	999
	A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,	999
	Whose unavoided eye is murderous.	999
	999
LORD STANLEY	Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	And I in all unwillingness will go.	999
	I would to God that the inclusive verge	999
	Of golden metal that must round my brow	999
	Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!	999
	Anointed let me be with deadly venom,	999
	And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory	999
	To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	No! why?  When he that is my husband now	999
	Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,	999
	When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands	999
	Which issued from my other angel husband	999
	And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;	999
	O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,	999
	This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,	999
	For making me, so young, so old a widow!	999
	And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;	999
	And be thy wife--if any be so mad--	999
	As miserable by the life of thee	999
	As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!	999
	Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,	999
	Even in so short a space, my woman's heart	999
	Grossly grew captive to his honey words	999
	And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,	999
	Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;	999
	For never yet one hour in his bed	999
	Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,	999
	But have been waked by his timorous dreams.	999
	Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;	999
	And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.	999
	999
LADY ANNE	No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!	999
	999
LADY ANNE	Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	[To DORSET]	999
	999
	Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!	999
	999
	[To LADY ANNE]	999
	999
	Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!	999
	999
	[To QUEEN ELIZABETH]	999
	999
	Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!	999
	I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!	999
	Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,	999
	And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.	999
	Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes	999
	Whom envy hath immured within your walls!	999
	Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!	999
	Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow	999
	For tender princes, use my babies well!	999
	So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.	999

SCENE II	London. The palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Sennet. Enter KING RICHARD III, in pomp, crowned;	999
	BUCKINGHAM, CATESBY, a page, and others]	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	My gracious sovereign?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Give me thy hand.	999
	999
	[Here he ascendeth his throne]	999
	999
	Thus high, by thy advice	999
	And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;	999
	But shall we wear these honours for a day?	999
	Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Still live they and for ever may they last!	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,	999
	To try if thou be current gold indeed	999
	Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Say on, my loving lord.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	True, noble prince.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	O bitter consequence,	999
	That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'	999
	Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:	999
	Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;	999
	And I would have it suddenly perform'd.	999
	What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Your grace may do your pleasure.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:	999
	Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord	999
	Before I positively herein:	999
	I will resolve your grace immediately.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
CATESBY	[Aside to a stander by]	999
	999
	The king is angry: see, he bites the lip.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	I will converse with iron-witted fools	999
	And unrespective boys: none are for me	999
	That look into me with considerate eyes:	999
	High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.	999
	Boy!	999
	999
Page	My lord?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold	999
	Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?	999
	999
Page	My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,	999
	Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:	999
	Gold were as good as twenty orators,	999
	And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	What is his name?	999
	999
Page	                His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	I partly know the man: go, call him hither.	999
	999
	[Exit Page]	999
	999
	The deep-revolving witty Buckingham	999
	No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:	999
	Hath he so long held out with me untired,	999
	And stops he now for breath?	999
	999
	[Enter STANLEY]	999
	999
	How now! what news with you?	999
	999
STANLEY	My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled	999
	To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea	999
	Where he abides.	999
	999
	[Stands apart]	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Catesby!	999
	999
CATESBY	       My lord?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	                         Rumour it abroad	999
	That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:	999
	I will take order for her keeping close.	999
	Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,	999
	Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:	999
	The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.	999
	Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out	999
	That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:	999
	About it; for it stands me much upon,	999
	To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.	999
	999
	[Exit CATESBY]	999
	999
	I must be married to my brother's daughter,	999
	Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.	999
	Murder her brothers, and then marry her!	999
	Uncertain way of gain! But I am in	999
	So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:	999
	Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.	999
	999
	[Re-enter Page, with TYRREL]	999
	999
	Is thy name Tyrrel?	999
	999
TYRREL	James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Art thou, indeed?	999
	999
TYRREL	           Prove me, my gracious sovereign.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?	999
	999
TYRREL	Ay, my lord;	999
	But I had rather kill two enemies.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,	999
	Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers	999
	Are they that I would have thee deal upon:	999
	Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.	999
	999
TYRREL	Let me have open means to come to them,	999
	And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel	999
	Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:	999
	999
	[Whispers]	999
	999
	There is no more but so: say it is done,	999
	And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.	999
	999
TYRREL	'Tis done, my gracious lord.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?	999
	999
TYRREL	Ye shall, my Lord.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
	[Re-enter BUCKINGHAM]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind	999
	The late demand that you did sound me in.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	I hear that news, my lord.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,	999
	For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;	999
	The earldom of Hereford and the moveables	999
	The which you promised I should possess.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey	999
	Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	What says your highness to my just demand?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	As I remember, Henry the Sixth	999
	Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,	999
	When Richmond was a little peevish boy.	999
	A king, perhaps, perhaps,--	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	My lord!	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	How chance the prophet could not at that time	999
	Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	My lord, your promise for the earldom,--	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,	999
	The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,	999
	And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,	999
	Because a bard of Ireland told me once	999
	I should not live long after I saw Richmond.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	My Lord!	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	       Ay, what's o'clock?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	I am thus bold to put your grace in mind	999
	Of what you promised me.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Well, but what's o'clock?	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Upon the stroke of ten.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Well, let it strike.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Why let it strike?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke	999
	Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.	999
	I am not in the giving vein to-day.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Tut, tut,	999
	Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM]	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Is it even so? rewards he my true service	999
	With such deep contempt made I him king for this?	999
	O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone	999
	To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!	999

SCENE III	The same.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter TYRREL]	999
	999
TYRREL	The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.	999
	The most arch of piteous massacre	999
	That ever yet this land was guilty of.	999
	Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn	999
	To do this ruthless piece of butchery,	999
	Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,	999
	Melting with tenderness and kind compassion	999
	Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.	999
	'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'	999
	'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another	999
	Within their innocent alabaster arms:	999
	Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,	999
	Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.	999
	A book of prayers on their pillow lay;	999
	Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;	999
	But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd	999
	Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered	999
	The most replenished sweet work of nature,	999
	That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'	999
	Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;	999
	They could not speak; and so I left them both,	999
	To bring this tidings to the bloody king.	999
	And here he comes.	999
	999
	[Enter KING RICHARD III]	999
	999
	All hail, my sovereign liege!	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?	999
	999
TYRREL	If to have done the thing you gave in charge	999
	Beget your happiness, be happy then,	999
	For it is done, my lord.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	But didst thou see them dead?	999
	999
TYRREL	I did, my lord.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	                 And buried, gentle Tyrrel?	999
	999
TYRREL	The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;	999
	But how or in what place I do not know.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,	999
	And thou shalt tell the process of their death.	999
	Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,	999
	And be inheritor of thy desire.	999
	Farewell till soon.	999
	999
	[Exit TYRREL]	999
	999
	The son of Clarence have I pent up close;	999
	His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;	999
	The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,	999
	And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.	999
	Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims	999
	At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,	999
	And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,	999
	To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.	999
	999
	[Enter CATESBY]	999
	999
CATESBY	My lord!	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?	999
	999
CATESBY	Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;	999
	And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,	999
	Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Ely with Richmond troubles me more near	999
	Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.	999
	Come, I have heard that fearful commenting	999
	Is leaden servitor to dull delay;	999
	Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary	999
	Then fiery expedition be my wing,	999
	Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!	999
	Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;	999
	We must be brief when traitors brave the field.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999

ACT IV	999
	999
	999
	999
SCENE IV	Before the palace.	999
	999
	999
	[Enter QUEEN MARGARET]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	So, now prosperity begins to mellow	999
	And drop into the rotten mouth of death.	999
	Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,	999
	To watch the waning of mine adversaries.	999
	A dire induction am I witness to,	999
	And will to France, hoping the consequence	999
	Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.	999
	Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?	999
	999
	[Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK]	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!	999
	My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!	999
	If yet your gentle souls fly in the air	999
	And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,	999
	Hover about me with your airy wings	999
	And hear your mother's lamentation!	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Hover about her; say, that right for right	999
	Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	So many miseries have crazed my voice,	999
	That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,	999
	Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.	999
	Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,	999
	And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?	999
	When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,	999
	Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,	999
	Brief abstract and record of tedious days,	999
	Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,	999
	999
	[Sitting down]	999
	999
	Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave	999
	As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!	999
	Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.	999
	O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?	999
	999
	[Sitting down by her]	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	If ancient sorrow be most reverend,	999
	Give mine the benefit of seniory,	999
	And let my woes frown on the upper hand.	999
	If sorrow can admit society,	999
	999
	[Sitting down with them]	999
	999
	Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:	999
	I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;	999
	I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:	999
	Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;	999
	Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;	999
	I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.	999
	From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept	999
	A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:	999
	That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,	999
	To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,	999
	That foul defacer of God's handiwork,	999
	That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,	999
	That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,	999
	Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.	999
	O upright, just, and true-disposing God,	999
	How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur	999
	Preys on the issue of his mother's body,	999
	And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!	999
	God witness with me, I have wept for thine.	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,	999
	And now I cloy me with beholding it.	999
	Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:	999
	Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;	999
	Young York he is but boot, because both they	999
	Match not the high perfection of my loss:	999
	Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;	999
	And the beholders of this tragic play,	999
	The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,	999
	Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.	999
	Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,	999
	Only reserved their factor, to buy souls	999
	And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,	999
	Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:	999
	Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.	999
	To have him suddenly convey'd away.	999
	Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,	999
	That I may live to say, The dog is dead!	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	O, thou didst prophesy the time would come	999
	That I should wish for thee to help me curse	999
	That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;	999
	I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;	999
	The presentation of but what I was;	999
	The flattering index of a direful pageant;	999
	One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;	999
	A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;	999
	A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,	999
	A sign of dignity, a garish flag,	999
	To be the aim of every dangerous shot,	999
	A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.	999
	Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?	999
	Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?	999
	Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?	999
	Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?	999
	Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?	999
	Decline all this, and see what now thou art:	999
	For happy wife, a most distressed widow;	999
	For joyful mother, one that wails the name;	999
	For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;	999
	For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;	999
	For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;	999
	For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;	999
	For one commanding all, obey'd of none.	999
	Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,	999
	And left thee but a very prey to time;	999
	Having no more but thought of what thou wert,	999
	To torture thee the more, being what thou art.	999
	Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not	999
	Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?	999
	Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;	999
	From which even here I slip my weary neck,	999
	And leave the burthen of it all on thee.	999
	Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:	999
	These English woes will make me smile in France.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,	999
	And teach me how to curse mine enemies!	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;	999
	Compare dead happiness with living woe;	999
	Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,	999
	And he that slew them fouler than he is:	999
	Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:	999
	Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!	999
	999
QUEEN MARGARET	Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Why should calamity be full of words?	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Windy attorneys to their client woes,	999
	Airy succeeders of intestate joys,	999
	Poor breathing orators of miseries!	999
	Let them have scope: though what they do impart	999
	Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.	999
	And in the breath of bitter words let's smother	999
	My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.	999
	I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.	999
	999
	[Enter KING RICHARD III, marching, with drums and trumpets]	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Who intercepts my expedition?	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	O, she that might have intercepted thee,	999
	By strangling thee in her accursed womb	999
	From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,	999
	Where should be graven, if that right were right,	999
	The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,	999
	And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?	999
	Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?	999
	And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!	999
	Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women	999
	Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!	999
	999
	[Flourish. Alarums]	999
	999
	Either be patient, and entreat me fair,	999
	Or with the clamorous report of war	999
	Thus will I drown your exclamations.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Art thou my son?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Then patiently hear my impatience.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Madam, I have a touch of your condition,	999
	Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	O, let me speak!	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	                  Do then: but I'll not hear.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	I will be mild and gentle in my speech.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,	999
	God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	And came I not at last to comfort you?	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,	999
	Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.	999
	A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;	999
	Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;	999
	Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,	999
	Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,	999
	Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,	999
	treacherous,	999
	More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:	999
	What comfortable hour canst thou name,	999
	That ever graced me in thy company?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd	999
	your grace	999
	To breakfast once forth of my company.	999
	If I be so disgracious in your sight,	999
	Let me march on, and not offend your grace.	999
	Strike the drum.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	                  I prithee, hear me speak.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	You speak too bitterly.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Hear me a word;	999
	For I shall never speak to thee again.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	So.	999
	999
DUCHESS OF YORK	Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,	999
	Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,	999
	Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish	999
	And never look upon thy face again.	999
	Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;	999
	Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more	999
	Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!	999
	My prayers on the adverse party fight;	999
	And there the little souls of Edward's children	999
	Whisper the spirits of thine enemies	999
	And promise them success and victory.	999
	Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;	999
	Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse	999
	Abides in me; I say amen to all.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	I have no more sons of the royal blood	999
	For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,	999
	They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;	999
	And therefore level not to hit their lives.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,	999
	Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	And must she die for this? O, let her live,	999
	And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;	999
	Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;	999
	Throw over her the veil of infamy:	999
	So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,	999
	I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	To save her life, I'll say she is not so.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Her life is only safest in her birth.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	And only in that safety died her brothers.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	All unavoided is the doom of destiny.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	True, when avoided grace makes destiny:	999
	My babes were destined to a fairer death,	999
	If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd	999
	Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.	999
	Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,	999
	Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:	999
	No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt	999
	Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,	999
	To revel in the entrails of my lambs.	999
	But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,	999
	My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys	999
	Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;	999
	And I, in such a desperate bay of death,	999
	Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,	999
	Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise	999
	And dangerous success of bloody wars,	999
	As I intend more good to you and yours,	999
	Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,	999
	To be discover'd, that can do me good?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	The advancement of your children, gentle lady.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	No, to the dignity and height of honour	999
	The high imperial type of this earth's glory.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Flatter my sorrows with report of it;	999
	Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,	999
	Canst thou demise to any child of mine?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,	999
	Will I withal endow a child of thine;	999
	So in the Lethe of thy angry soul	999
	Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs	999
	Which thou supposest I have done to thee.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness	999
	Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	What do you think?	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:	999
	So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;	999
	And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:	999
	I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,	999
	And mean to make her queen of England.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Even he that makes her queen who should be else?	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	What, thou?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	I, even I: what think you of it, madam?	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	How canst thou woo her?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	That would I learn of you,	999
	As one that are best acquainted with her humour.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	And wilt thou learn of me?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Madam, with all my heart.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,	999
	A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave	999
	Edward and York; then haply she will weep:	999
	Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret	999
	Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--	999
	A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain	999
	The purple sap from her sweet brother's body	999
	And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.	999
	If this inducement force her not to love,	999
	Send her a story of thy noble acts;	999
	Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,	999
	Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,	999
	Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way	999
	To win our daughter.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	There is no other way	999
	Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,	999
	And not be Richard that hath done all this.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Say that I did all this for love of her.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,	999
	Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Look, what is done cannot be now amended:	999
	Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,	999
	Which after hours give leisure to repent.	999
	If I did take the kingdom from your sons,	999
	To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.	999
	If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,	999
	To quicken your increase, I will beget	999
	Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter	999
	A grandam's name is little less in love	999
	Than is the doting title of a mother;	999
	They are as children but one step below,	999
	Even of your mettle, of your very blood;	999
	Of an one pain, save for a night of groans	999
	Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.	999
	Your children were vexation to your youth,	999
	But mine shall be a comfort to your age.	999
	The loss you have is but a son being king,	999
	And by that loss your daughter is made queen.	999
	I cannot make you what amends I would,	999
	Therefore accept such kindness as I can.	999
	Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul	999
	Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,	999
	This fair alliance quickly shall call home	999
	To high promotions and great dignity:	999
	The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.	999
	Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;	999
	Again shall you be mother to a king,	999
	And all the ruins of distressful times	999
	Repair'd with double riches of content.	999
	What! we have many goodly days to see:	999
	The liquid drops of tears that you have shed	999
	Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,	999
	Advantaging their loan with interest	999
	Of ten times double gain of happiness.	999
	Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go	999
	Make bold her bashful years with your experience;	999
	Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale	999
	Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame	999
	Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess	999
	With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys	999
	And when this arm of mine hath chastised	999
	The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,	999
	Bound with triumphant garlands will I come	999
	And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;	999
	To whom I will retail my conquest won,	999
	And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	What were I best to say? her father's brother	999
	Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?	999
	Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?	999
	Under what title shall I woo for thee,	999
	That God, the law, my honour and her love,	999
	Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Say that the king, which may command, entreats.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	That at her hands which the king's King forbids.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	To wail the tide, as her mother doth.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Say, I will love her everlastingly.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	But how long shall that title 'ever' last?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	So long as hell and Richard likes of it.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Be eloquent in my behalf to her.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;	999
	Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	I swear--	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	        By nothing; for this is no oath:	999
	The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;	999
	The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;	999
	The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.	999
	if something thou wilt swear to be believed,	999
	Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Now, by the world--	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	My father's death--	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Thy life hath that dishonour'd.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Then, by myself--	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	                  Thyself thyself misusest.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Why then, by God--	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	                  God's wrong is most of all.	999
	If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,	999
	The unity the king thy brother made	999
	Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:	999
	If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,	999
	The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,	999
	Had graced the tender temples of my child,	999
	And both the princes had been breathing here,	999
	Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,	999
	Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.	999
	What canst thou swear by now?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	The time to come.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;	999
	For I myself have many tears to wash	999
	Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.	999
	The children live, whose parents thou hast	999
	slaughter'd,	999
	Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;	999
	The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,	999
	Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.	999
	Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast	999
	Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	As I intend to prosper and repent,	999
	So thrive I in my dangerous attempt	999
	Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!	999
	Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!	999
	Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!	999
	Be opposite all planets of good luck	999
	To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,	999
	Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,	999
	I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!	999
	In her consists my happiness and thine;	999
	Without her, follows to this land and me,	999
	To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,	999
	Death, desolation, ruin and decay:	999
	It cannot be avoided but by this;	999
	It will not be avoided but by this.	999
	Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--	999
	Be the attorney of my love to her:	999
	Plead what I will be, not what I have been;	999
	Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:	999
	Urge the necessity and state of times,	999
	And be not peevish-fond in great designs.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Shall I forget myself to be myself?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	But thou didst kill my children.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	But in your daughter's womb I bury them:	999
	Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed	999
	Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	And be a happy mother by the deed.	999
	999
QUEEN ELIZABETH	I go. Write to me very shortly.	999
	And you shall understand from me her mind.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.	999

	[Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following]	999
	999
	How now! what news?	999
	999
RATCLIFF	My gracious sovereign, on the western coast	999
	Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore	999
	Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,	999
	Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:	999
	'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;	999
	And there they hull, expecting but the aid	999
	Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:	999
	Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?	999
	999
CATESBY	Here, my lord.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Fly to the duke:	999
	999
	[To RATCLIFF]	999
	999
	Post thou to Salisbury	999
	When thou comest thither--	999
	999
	[To CATESBY]	999
	999
		     Dull, unmindful villain,	999
	Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?	999
	999
CATESBY	First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,	999
	What from your grace I shall deliver to him.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight	999
	The greatest strength and power he can make,	999
	And meet me presently at Salisbury.	999
	999
CATESBY	I go.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
RATCLIFF	What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at	999
	Salisbury?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?	999
	999
RATCLIFF	Your highness told me I should post before.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.	999
	999
	[Enter STANLEY]	999
	999
	How now, what news with you?	999
	999
STANLEY	None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;	999
	Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!	999
	Why dost thou run so many mile about,	999
	When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?	999
	Once more, what news?	999
	999
STANLEY	Richmond is on the seas.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	There let him sink, and be the seas on him!	999
	White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?	999
	999
STANLEY	I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?	999
	999
STANLEY	Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,	999
	He makes for England, there to claim the crown.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?	999
	Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?	999
	What heir of York is there alive but we?	999
	And who is England's king but great York's heir?	999
	Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?	999
	999
STANLEY	Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Unless for that he comes to be your liege,	999
	You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.	999
	Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.	999
	999
STANLEY	No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?	999
	Where are thy tenants and thy followers?	999
	Are they not now upon the western shore.	999
	Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!	999
	999
STANLEY	No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,	999
	When they should serve their sovereign in the west?	999
	999
STANLEY	They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:	999
	Please it your majesty to give me leave,	999
	I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace	999
	Where and what time your majesty shall please.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:	999
	I will not trust you, sir.	999
	999
STANLEY	Most mighty sovereign,	999
	You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:	999
	I never was nor never will be false.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Well,	999
	Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind	999
	Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.	999
	Or else his head's assurance is but frail.	999
	999
STANLEY	So deal with him as I prove true to you.	999

	With many more confederates, are in arms.	999
	999
	[Enter another Messenger]	999
	999
Second Messenger	My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;	999
	And every hour more competitors	999
	Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth.	999
	999
	[Enter another Messenger]	999
	999
Third Messenger	My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?	999
	999
	[He striketh him]	999
	999
	Take that, until thou bring me better news.	999
	999
Third Messenger	The news I have to tell your majesty	999
	Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,	999
	Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;	999
	And he himself wander'd away alone,	999
	No man knows whither.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	I cry thee mercy:	999
	There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.	999
	Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd	999
	Reward to him that brings the traitor in?	999
	999
Third Messenger	Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.	999
	999
	[Enter another Messenger]	999
	999
Fourth Messenger	Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,	999
	'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.	999
	Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,	999
	The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:	999
	Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat	999
	Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks	999
	If they were his assistants, yea or no;	999
	Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.	999
	Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,	999
	Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	March on, march on, since we are up in arms;	999
	If not to fight with foreign enemies,	999
	Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.	999
	999
	[Re-enter CATESBY]	999
	999
CATESBY	My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;	999
	That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond	999
	Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,	999
	Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,	999

	That in the sty of this most bloody boar	999
	My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:	999
	If I revolt, off goes young George's head;	999
	The fear of that withholds my present aid.	999
	But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?	999
	999
CHRISTOPHER	At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.	999
	999
DERBY	What men of name resort to him?	999
	999
CHRISTOPHER	Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;	999
	Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;	999
	Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,	999
	And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;	999

	999
DERBY	Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:	999

	Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,	999
	Vaughan, and all that have miscarried	999
	By underhand corrupted foul injustice,	999
	If that your moody discontented souls	999

	This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?	999
	999
Sheriff	It is, my lord.	999
	999
BUCKINGHAM	Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.	999
	This is the day that, in King Edward's time,	999
	I wish't might fall on me, when I was found	999
	False to his children or his wife's allies	999
	This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall	999
	By the false faith of him I trusted most;	999
	This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul	999
	Is the determined respite of my wrongs:	999
	That high All-Seer that I dallied with	999
	Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head	999
	And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.	999
	Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men	999
	To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:	999

	The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,	999
	That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,	999
	Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough	999
	In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine	999
	Lies now even in the centre of this isle,	999
	Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn	999
	From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.	999
	In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,	999

NORFOLK	Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.	999

	Let us survey the vantage of the field	999

	Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,	999
	Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?	999
	999
BLUNT	Unless I have mista'en his colours much,	999
	Which well I am assured I have not done,	999
	His regiment lies half a mile at least	999
	South from the mighty power of the king.	999
	999
RICHMOND	If without peril it be possible,	999
	Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,	999

	And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!	999

	999
KING RICHARD III	What is't o'clock?	999
	999
CATESBY	                  It's supper-time, my lord;	999
	It's nine o'clock.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	                  I will not sup to-night.	999
	Give me some ink and paper.	999
	What, is my beaver easier than it was?	999
	And all my armour laid into my tent?	999
	999
CATESBY	If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;	999
	Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.	999
	999
NORFOLK	I go, my lord.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Stir with the lark to-morrow, gentle Norfolk.	999
	999
NORFOLK	I warrant you, my lord.	999
	999
	[Exit]	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Catesby!	999
	999
CATESBY	My lord?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Send out a pursuivant at arms	999
	To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power	999
	Before sunrising, lest his son George fall	999
	Into the blind cave of eternal night.	999
	999
	[Exit CATESBY]	999
	999
	Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.	999
	Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.	999
	Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.	999
	Ratcliff!	999
	999
RATCLIFF	My lord?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?	999
	999
RATCLIFF	Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,	999
	Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop	999
	Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:	999
	I have not that alacrity of spirit,	999
	Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.	999
	Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?	999
	999
RATCLIFF	It is, my lord.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	                  Bid my guard watch; leave me.	999
	Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent	999
	And help to arm me. Leave me, I say.	999

DERBY	Fortune and victory sit on thy helm!	999
	999
RICHMOND	All comfort that the dark night can afford	999
	Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!	999
	Tell me, how fares our loving mother?	999
	999
DERBY	I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother	999
	Who prays continually for Richmond's good:	999
	So much for that. The silent hours steal on,	999
	And flaky darkness breaks within the east.	999
	In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--	999
	Prepare thy battle early in the morning,	999
	And put thy fortune to the arbitrement	999
	Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.	999
	I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--	999
	With best advantage will deceive the time,	999
	And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:	999
	But on thy side I may not be too forward	999
	Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,	999
	Be executed in his father's sight.	999
	Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time	999
	Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love	999
	And ample interchange of sweet discourse,	999
	Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:	999
	God give us leisure for these rites of love!	999
	Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!	999
	999
RICHMOND	Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:	999
	I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,	999
	Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,	999
	When I should mount with wings of victory:	999
	Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.	999
	999
	[Exeunt all but RICHMOND]	999
	999
	O Thou, whose captain I account myself,	999
	Look on my forces with a gracious eye;	999
	Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,	999
	That they may crush down with a heavy fall	999
	The usurping helmets of our adversaries!	999
	Make us thy ministers of chastisement,	999
	That we may praise thee in the victory!	999
	To thee I do commend my watchful soul,	999
	Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:	999
	Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!	999

	999
	Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster	999

	999
Ghost of VAUGHAN	[To KING RICHARD III]	999
	999

	999
	[To RICHMOND]	999
	999
	I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid:	999
	But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismay'd:	999
	God and good angel fight on Richmond's side;	999

	999
KING RICHARD III	Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.	999
	Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.	999
	O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!	999
	The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.	999
	Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.	999
	What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:	999
	Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.	999
	Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:	999
	Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:	999
	Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?	999
	Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good	999
	That I myself have done unto myself?	999
	O, no! alas, I rather hate myself	999
	For hateful deeds committed by myself!	999
	I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.	999
	Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.	999
	My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,	999
	And every tongue brings in a several tale,	999
	And every tale condemns me for a villain.	999
	Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree	999
	Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;	999
	All several sins, all used in each degree,	999
	Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!	999
	I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;	999
	And if I die, no soul shall pity me:	999
	Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself	999
	Find in myself no pity to myself?	999
	Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd	999
	Came to my tent; and every one did threat	999
	To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.	999
	999
	[Enter RATCLIFF]	999
	999
RATCLIFF	My lord!	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	'Zounds! who is there?	999
	999
RATCLIFF	Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock	999
	Hath twice done salutation to the morn;	999
	Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!	999
	What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?	999
	999
RATCLIFF	No doubt, my lord.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	                  O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--	999
	999
RATCLIFF	Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night	999
	Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard	999
	Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers	999
	Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.	999
	It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;	999
	Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,	999
	To see if any mean to shrink from me.	999
	999
	[Exeunt]	999
	999
	[Enter the Lords to RICHMOND, sitting in his tent]	999
	999
LORDS	Good morrow, Richmond!	999
	999
RICHMOND	Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,	999
	That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.	999
	999
LORDS	How have you slept, my lord?	999
	999
RICHMOND	The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams	999
	That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,	999
	Have I since your departure had, my lords.	999
	Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,	999
	Came to my tent, and cried on victory:	999
	I promise you, my soul is very jocund	999
	In the remembrance of so fair a dream.	999
	How far into the morning is it, lords?	999
	999
LORDS	Upon the stroke of four.	999
	999
RICHMOND	Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.	999
	999
	[His oration to his soldiers]	999
	999
	More than I have said, loving countrymen,	999
	The leisure and enforcement of the time	999
	Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,	999
	God and our good cause fight upon our side;	999
	The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,	999
	Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;	999
	Richard except, those whom we fight against	999
	Had rather have us win than him they follow:	999
	For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,	999
	A bloody tyrant and a homicide;	999
	One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;	999
	One that made means to come by what he hath,	999
	And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;	999
	Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil	999
	Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;	999
	One that hath ever been God's enemy:	999
	Then, if you fight against God's enemy,	999
	God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;	999
	If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,	999
	You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;	999
	If you do fight against your country's foes,	999
	Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;	999
	If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,	999
	Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;	999
	If you do free your children from the sword,	999
	Your children's children quit it in your age.	999
	Then, in the name of God and all these rights,	999
	Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.	999
	For me, the ransom of my bold attempt	999
	Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;	999
	But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt	999
	The least of you shall share his part thereof.	999
	Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;	999
	God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!	999

KING RICHARD III	What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?	999
	999
RATCLIFF	That he was never trained up in arms.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?	999
	999
RATCLIFF	He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	He was in the right; and so indeed it is.	999
	999
	[Clock striketh]	999
	999
	Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.	999
	Who saw the sun to-day?	999
	999
RATCLIFF	Not I, my lord.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Then he disdains to shine; for by the book	999
	He should have braved the east an hour ago	999
	A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!	999
	999
RATCLIFF	        My lord?	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	The sun will not be seen to-day;	999
	The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.	999
	I would these dewy tears were from the ground.	999
	Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me	999
	More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven	999
	That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.	999
	999
	[Enter NORFOLK]	999
	999
NORFOLK	Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.	999
	Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:	999
	I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,	999
	And thus my battle shall be ordered:	999
	My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,	999
	Consisting equally of horse and foot;	999
	Our archers shall be placed in the midst	999
	John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,	999
	Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.	999
	They thus directed, we will follow	999
	In the main battle, whose puissance on either side	999
	Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.	999
	This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?	999
	999
NORFOLK	A good direction, warlike sovereign.	999
	This found I on my tent this morning.	999
	999
	[He sheweth him a paper]	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	[Reads]	999
	999
	'Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,	999
	For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'	999
	A thing devised by the enemy.	999
	Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge	999
	Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:	999
	Conscience is but a word that cowards use,	999
	Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:	999
	Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.	999
	March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell	999
	If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.	999
	999
	[His oration to his Army]	999
	999
	What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?	999
	Remember whom you are to cope withal;	999
	A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,	999
	A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,	999
	Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth	999
	To desperate ventures and assured destruction.	999
	You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;	999
	You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,	999
	They would restrain the one, distain the other.	999
	And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,	999
	Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?	999
	A milk-sop, one that never in his life	999
	Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?	999
	Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;	999
	Lash hence these overweening rags of France,	999
	These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;	999
	Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,	999
	For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:	999
	If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,	999
	And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers	999
	Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,	999
	And in record, left them the heirs of shame.	999
	Shall these enjoy our lands?  lie with our wives?	999
	Ravish our daughters?	999
	999
	[Drum afar off]	999
	999
		Hark! I hear their drum.	999
	Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yoemen!	999
	Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!	999
	Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;	999
	Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!	999
	999
	[Enter a Messenger]	999
	999
	What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?	999

Messenger	My lord, he doth deny to come.	999

KING RICHARD III	Off with his son George's head!	999
	999
NORFOLK	My lord, the enemy is past the marsh	999
	After the battle let George Stanley die.	999
	999
KING RICHARD III	A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:	999
	Advance our standards, set upon our foes	999

	crown, with divers other Lords]	999
	999
RICHMOND	God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,	999
	The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.	999
	999
DERBY	Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.	999
	Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty	999
	From the dead temples of this bloody wretch	999
	Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:	999
	Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.	999
	999
RICHMOND	Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!	999
	But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?	999
	999
DERBY	He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;	999
	Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.	999
	999
RICHMOND	What men of name are slain on either side?	999
	999
DERBY	John Duke of Norfolk, Walter Lord Ferrers,	999
	Sir Robert Brakenbury, and Sir William Brandon.	999
	999
RICHMOND	Inter their bodies as becomes their births:	999
	Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled	999
	That in submission will return to us:	999
	And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,	999
	We will unite the white rose and the red:	999
	Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,	999
	That long have frown'd upon their enmity!	999
	What traitor hears me, and says not amen?	999
	England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;	999
	The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,	999
	The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,	999
	The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:	999
	All this divided York and Lancaster,	999
	Divided in their dire division,	999
	O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,	999
	The true succeeders of each royal house,	999
	By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!	999
	And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.	999
	Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,	999
	With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!	999
	Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,	999
	That would reduce these bloody days again,	999
	And make poor England weep in streams of blood!	999
	Let them not live to taste this land's increase	999
	That would with treason wound this fair land's peace!	999
	Now civil wounds are stopp'd, peace lives again:	999
	That she may long live here, God say amen!	999
	999
