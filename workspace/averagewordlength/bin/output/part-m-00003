THESE INSUING SONNETS	999
MR. W. H. ALL HAPPINESS	999
AND THAT ETERNITY	999
PROMISED BY	999
OUR EVER-LIVING POET WISHETH	999
THE WELL-WISHING	999
ADVENTURER IN	999
SETTING FORTH	999
T. T.	999
	999
	999
I.	999
	999
FROM fairest creatures we desire increase,	999
That thereby beauty's rose might never die,	999
But as the riper should by time decease,	999
His tender heir might bear his memory:	999
But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,	999
Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,	999
Making a famine where abundance lies,	999
Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.	999
Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament	999
And only herald to the gaudy spring,	999
Within thine own bud buriest thy content	999
And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.	999
  Pity the world, or else this glutton be,	999
  To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.	999
	999
II.	999
	999
When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,	999
And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,	999
Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,	999
Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:	999
Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,	999
Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,	999
To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,	999
Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.	999
How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,	999
If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine	999
Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'	999
Proving his beauty by succession thine!	999
  This were to be new made when thou art old,	999
  And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.	999
	999
III.	999
	999
Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest	999
Now is the time that face should form another;	999
Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,	999
Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.	999
For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb	999
Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?	999
Or who is he so fond will be the tomb	999
Of his self-love, to stop posterity?	999
Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee	999
Calls back the lovely April of her prime:	999
So thou through windows of thine age shall see	999
Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.	999
  But if thou live, remember'd not to be,	999
  Die single, and thine image dies with thee.	999
	999
IV.	999
	999
Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend	999
Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?	999
Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,	999
And being frank she lends to those are free.	999
Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse	999
The bounteous largess given thee to give?	999
Profitless usurer, why dost thou use	999
So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?	999
For having traffic with thyself alone,	999
Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.	999
Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,	999
What acceptable audit canst thou leave?	999
  Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,	999
  Which, used, lives th' executor to be.	999
	999
V.	999
	999
Those hours, that with gentle work did frame	999
The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,	999
Will play the tyrants to the very same	999
And that unfair which fairly doth excel:	999
For never-resting time leads summer on	999
To hideous winter and confounds him there;	999
Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,	999
Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:	999
Then, were not summer's distillation left,	999
A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,	999
Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,	999
Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:	999
  But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,	999
  Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.	999
	999
VI.	999
	999
Then let not winter's ragged hand deface	999
In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:	999
Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place	999
With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.	999
That use is not forbidden usury,	999
Which happies those that pay the willing loan;	999
That's for thyself to breed another thee,	999
Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;	999
Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,	999
If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:	999
Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,	999
Leaving thee living in posterity?	999
  Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair	999
  To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.	999
	999
VII.	999
	999
Lo! in the orient when the gracious light	999
Lifts up his burning head, each under eye	999
Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,	999
Serving with looks his sacred majesty;	999
And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,	999
Resembling strong youth in his middle age,	999
yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,	999
Attending on his golden pilgrimage;	999
But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,	999
Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,	999
The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are	999
From his low tract and look another way:	999
  So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,	999
  Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.	999
	999
VIII.	999
	999
Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?	999
Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.	999
Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,	999
Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?	999
If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,	999
By unions married, do offend thine ear,	999
They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds	999
In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.	999
Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,	999
Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,	999
Resembling sire and child and happy mother	999
Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:	999
  Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,	999
  Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'	999
	999
IX.	999
	999
Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye	999
That thou consumest thyself in single life?	999
Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.	999
The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;	999
The world will be thy widow and still weep	999
That thou no form of thee hast left behind,	999
When every private widow well may keep	999
By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.	999
Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend	999
Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;	999
But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,	999
And kept unused, the user so destroys it.	999
  No love toward others in that bosom sits	999
  That on himself such murderous shame commits.	999
	999
X.	999
	999
For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,	999
Who for thyself art so unprovident.	999
Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,	999
But that thou none lovest is most evident;	999
For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate	999
That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.	999
Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate	999
Which to repair should be thy chief desire.	999
O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!	999
Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?	999
Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,	999
Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:	999
  Make thee another self, for love of me,	999
  That beauty still may live in thine or thee.	999
	999
XI.	999
	999
As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest	999
In one of thine, from that which thou departest;	999
And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest	999
Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.	999
Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:	999
Without this, folly, age and cold decay:	999
If all were minded so, the times should cease	999
And threescore year would make the world away.	999
Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,	999
Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:	999
Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;	999
Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:	999
  She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby	999
  Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.	999
	999
XII.	999
	999
When I do count the clock that tells the time,	999
And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;	999
When I behold the violet past prime,	999
And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;	999
When lofty trees I see barren of leaves	999
Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,	999
And summer's green all girded up in sheaves	999
Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,	999
Then of thy beauty do I question make,	999
That thou among the wastes of time must go,	999
Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake	999
And die as fast as they see others grow;	999
  And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence	999
  Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.	999
	999
XIII.	999
	999
O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are	999
No longer yours than you yourself here live:	999
Against this coming end you should prepare,	999
And your sweet semblance to some other give.	999
So should that beauty which you hold in lease	999
Find no determination: then you were	999
Yourself again after yourself's decease,	999
When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.	999
Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,	999
Which husbandry in honour might uphold	999
Against the stormy gusts of winter's day	999
And barren rage of death's eternal cold?	999
  O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know	999
  You had a father: let your son say so.	999
	999
XIV.	999
	999
Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;	999
And yet methinks I have astronomy,	999
But not to tell of good or evil luck,	999
Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;	999
Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,	999
Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,	999
Or say with princes if it shall go well,	999
By oft predict that I in heaven find:	999
But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,	999
And, constant stars, in them I read such art	999
As truth and beauty shall together thrive,	999
If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;	999
  Or else of thee this I prognosticate:	999
  Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.	999
	999
XV.	999
	999
When I consider every thing that grows	999
Holds in perfection but a little moment,	999
That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows	999
Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;	999
When I perceive that men as plants increase,	999
Cheered and cheque'd even by the self-same sky,	999
Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,	999
And wear their brave state out of memory;	999
Then the conceit of this inconstant stay	999
Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,	999
Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,	999
To change your day of youth to sullied night;	999
  And all in war with Time for love of you,	999
  As he takes from you, I engraft you new.	999
	999
XVI.	999
	999
But wherefore do not you a mightier way	999
Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?	999
And fortify yourself in your decay	999
With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?	999
Now stand you on the top of happy hours,	999
And many maiden gardens yet unset	999
With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,	999
Much liker than your painted counterfeit:	999
So should the lines of life that life repair,	999
Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,	999
Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,	999
Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.	999
  To give away yourself keeps yourself still,	999
  And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.	999
	999
XVII.	999
	999
Who will believe my verse in time to come,	999
If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?	999
Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb	999
Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.	999
If I could write the beauty of your eyes	999
And in fresh numbers number all your graces,	999
The age to come would say 'This poet lies:	999
Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'	999
So should my papers yellow'd with their age	999
Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,	999
And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage	999
And stretched metre of an antique song:	999
  But were some child of yours alive that time,	999
  You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.	999
	999
XVIII.	999
	999
Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?	999
Thou art more lovely and more temperate:	999
Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,	999
And summer's lease hath all too short a date:	999
Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,	999
And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;	999
And every fair from fair sometime declines,	999
By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;	999
But thy eternal summer shall not fade	999
Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;	999
Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,	999
When in eternal lines to time thou growest:	999
  So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,	999
  So long lives this and this gives life to thee.	999
	999
XIX.	999
	999
Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,	999
And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;	999
Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,	999
And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;	999
Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,	999
And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,	999
To the wide world and all her fading sweets;	999
But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:	999
O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,	999
Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;	999
Him in thy course untainted do allow	999
For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.	999
  Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,	999
  My love shall in my verse ever live young.	999
	999
XX.	999
	999
A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted	999
Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;	999
A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted	999
With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;	999
An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,	999
Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;	999
A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,	999
Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.	999
And for a woman wert thou first created;	999
Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,	999
And by addition me of thee defeated,	999
By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.	999
  But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,	999
  Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.	999
	999
XXI.	999
	999
So is it not with me as with that Muse	999
Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,	999
Who heaven itself for ornament doth use	999
And every fair with his fair doth rehearse	999
Making a couplement of proud compare,	999
With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,	999
With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare	999
That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.	999
O' let me, true in love, but truly write,	999
And then believe me, my love is as fair	999
As any mother's child, though not so bright	999
As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:	999
  Let them say more than like of hearsay well;	999
  I will not praise that purpose not to sell.	999
	999
XXII.	999
	999
My glass shall not persuade me I am old,	999
So long as youth and thou are of one date;	999
But when in thee time's furrows I behold,	999
Then look I death my days should expiate.	999
For all that beauty that doth cover thee	999
Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,	999
Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:	999
How can I then be elder than thou art?	999
O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary	999
As I, not for myself, but for thee will;	999
Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary	999
As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.	999
  Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;	999
  Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.	999
	999
XXIII.	999
	999
As an unperfect actor on the stage	999
Who with his fear is put besides his part,	999
Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,	999
Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.	999
So I, for fear of trust, forget to say	999
The perfect ceremony of love's rite,	999
And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,	999
O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.	999
O, let my books be then the eloquence	999
And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,	999
Who plead for love and look for recompense	999
More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.	999
  O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:	999
  To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.	999
	999
XXIV.	999
	999
Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd	999
Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;	999
My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,	999
And perspective it is the painter's art.	999
For through the painter must you see his skill,	999
To find where your true image pictured lies;	999
Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,	999
That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.	999
Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:	999
Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me	999
Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun	999
Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;	999
  Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;	999
  They draw but what they see, know not the heart.	999
	999
XXV.	999
	999
Let those who are in favour with their stars	999
Of public honour and proud titles boast,	999
Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,	999
Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.	999
Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread	999
But as the marigold at the sun's eye,	999
And in themselves their pride lies buried,	999
For at a frown they in their glory die.	999
The painful warrior famoused for fight,	999
After a thousand victories once foil'd,	999
Is from the book of honour razed quite,	999
And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:	999
  Then happy I, that love and am beloved	999
  Where I may not remove nor be removed.	999
	999
XXVI.	999
	999
Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage	999
Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,	999
To thee I send this written embassage,	999
To witness duty, not to show my wit:	999
Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine	999
May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,	999
But that I hope some good conceit of thine	999
In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;	999
Till whatsoever star that guides my moving	999
Points on me graciously with fair aspect	999
And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,	999
To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:	999
  Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;	999
  Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.	999
	999
XXVII.	999
	999
Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,	999
The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;	999
But then begins a journey in my head,	999
To work my mind, when body's work's expired:	999
For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,	999
Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,	999
And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,	999
Looking on darkness which the blind do see	999
Save that my soul's imaginary sight	999
Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,	999
Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,	999
Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.	999
  Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,	999
  For thee and for myself no quiet find.	999
	999
XXVIII.	999
	999
How can I then return in happy plight,	999
That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?	999
When day's oppression is not eased by night,	999
But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?	999
And each, though enemies to either's reign,	999
Do in consent shake hands to torture me;	999
The one by toil, the other to complain	999
How far I toil, still farther off from thee.	999
I tell the day, to please them thou art bright	999
And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:	999
So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,	999
When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.	999
But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer	999
  And night doth nightly make grief's strength	999
  	seem stronger.	999
	999
XXIX.	999
	999
When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,	999
I all alone beweep my outcast state	999
And trouble deal heaven with my bootless cries	999
And look upon myself and curse my fate,	999
Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,	999
Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,	999
Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,	999
With what I most enjoy contented least;	999
Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,	999
Haply I think on thee, and then my state,	999
Like to the lark at break of day arising	999
From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;	999
  For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings	999
  That then I scorn to change my state with kings.	999
	999
XXX.	999
	999
When to the sessions of sweet silent thought	999
I summon up remembrance of things past,	999
I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,	999
And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:	999
Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,	999
For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,	999
And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,	999
And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:	999
Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,	999
And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er	999
The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,	999
Which I new pay as if not paid before.	999
  But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,	999
  All losses are restored and sorrows end.	999
	999
XXXI.	999
	999
Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,	999
Which I by lacking have supposed dead,	999
And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,	999
And all those friends which I thought buried.	999
How many a holy and obsequious tear	999
Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye	999
As interest of the dead, which now appear	999
But things removed that hidden in thee lie!	999
Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,	999
Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,	999
Who all their parts of me to thee did give;	999
That due of many now is thine alone:	999
  Their images I loved I view in thee,	999
  And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.	999
	999
XXXII.	999
	999
If thou survive my well-contented day,	999
When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,	999
And shalt by fortune once more re-survey	999
These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,	999
Compare them with the bettering of the time,	999
And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,	999
Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,	999
Exceeded by the height of happier men.	999
O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:	999
'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,	999
A dearer birth than this his love had brought,	999
To march in ranks of better equipage:	999
  But since he died and poets better prove,	999
  Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'	999
	999
XXXIII.	999
	999
Full many a glorious morning have I seen	999
Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,	999
Kissing with golden face the meadows green,	999
Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;	999
Anon permit the basest clouds to ride	999
With ugly rack on his celestial face,	999
And from the forlorn world his visage hide,	999
Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:	999
Even so my sun one early morn did shine	999
With all triumphant splendor on my brow;	999
But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;	999
The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.	999
  Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;	999
  Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.	999
	999
XXXIV.	999
	999
Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,	999
And make me travel forth without my cloak,	999
To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,	999
Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?	999
'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,	999
To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,	999
For no man well of such a salve can speak	999
That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:	999
Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;	999
Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:	999
The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief	999
To him that bears the strong offence's cross.	999
  Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,	999
  And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.	999
	999
XXXV.	999
	999
No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:	999
Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;	999
Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,	999
And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.	999
All men make faults, and even I in this,	999
Authorizing thy trespass with compare,	999
Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,	999
Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;	999
For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--	999
Thy adverse party is thy advocate--	999
And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:	999
Such civil war is in my love and hate	999
  That I an accessary needs must be	999
  To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.	999
	999
XXXVI.	999
	999
Let me confess that we two must be twain,	999
Although our undivided loves are one:	999
So shall those blots that do with me remain	999
Without thy help by me be borne alone.	999
In our two loves there is but one respect,	999
Though in our lives a separable spite,	999
Which though it alter not love's sole effect,	999
Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.	999
I may not evermore acknowledge thee,	999
Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,	999
Nor thou with public kindness honour me,	999
Unless thou take that honour from thy name:	999
  But do not so; I love thee in such sort	999
  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.	999
	999
XXXVII.	999
	999
As a decrepit father takes delight	999
To see his active child do deeds of youth,	999
So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,	999
Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.	999
For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,	999
Or any of these all, or all, or more,	999
Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,	999
I make my love engrafted to this store:	999
So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,	999
Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give	999
That I in thy abundance am sufficed	999
And by a part of all thy glory live.	999
  Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:	999
  This wish I have; then ten times happy me!	999
	999
XXXVIII.	999
	999
How can my Muse want subject to invent,	999
While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse	999
Thine own sweet argument, too excellent	999
For every vulgar paper to rehearse?	999
O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me	999
Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;	999
For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,	999
When thou thyself dost give invention light?	999
Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth	999
Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;	999
And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth	999
Eternal numbers to outlive long date.	999
  If my slight Muse do please these curious days,	999
  The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.	999
	999
XXXIX.	999
	999
O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,	999
When thou art all the better part of me?	999
What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?	999
And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?	999
Even for this let us divided live,	999
And our dear love lose name of single one,	999
That by this separation I may give	999
That due to thee which thou deservest alone.	999
O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,	999
Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave	999
To entertain the time with thoughts of love,	999
Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,	999
  And that thou teachest how to make one twain,	999
  By praising him here who doth hence remain!	999
	999
XL.	999
	999
Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;	999
What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?	999
No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;	999
All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.	999
Then if for my love thou my love receivest,	999
I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;	999
But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest	999
By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.	999
I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,	999
Although thou steal thee all my poverty;	999
And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief	999
To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.	999
  Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,	999
  Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.	999
	999
XLI.	999
	999
Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,	999
When I am sometime absent from thy heart,	999
Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,	999
For still temptation follows where thou art.	999
Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,	999
Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;	999
And when a woman woos, what woman's son	999
Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?	999
Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,	999
And chide try beauty and thy straying youth,	999
Who lead thee in their riot even there	999
Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth,	999
  Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,	999
  Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.	999
	999
XLII.	999
	999
That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,	999
And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;	999
That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,	999
A loss in love that touches me more nearly.	999
Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:	999
Thou dost love her, because thou knowst I love her;	999
And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,	999
Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.	999
If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,	999
And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;	999
Both find each other, and I lose both twain,	999
And both for my sake lay on me this cross:	999
  But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;	999
  Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.	999
	999
XLIII.	999
	999
When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,	999
For all the day they view things unrespected;	999
But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,	999
And darkly bright are bright in dark directed.	999
Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,	999
How would thy shadow's form form happy show	999
To the clear day with thy much clearer light,	999
When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!	999
How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made	999
By looking on thee in the living day,	999
When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade	999
Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!	999
  All days are nights to see till I see thee,	999
  And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.	999
	999
XLIV.	999
	999
If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,	999
Injurious distance should not stop my way;	999
For then despite of space I would be brought,	999
From limits far remote where thou dost stay.	999
No matter then although my foot did stand	999
Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;	999
For nimble thought can jump both sea and land	999
As soon as think the place where he would be.	999
But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,	999
To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,	999
But that so much of earth and water wrought	999
I must attend time's leisure with my moan,	999
  Receiving nought by elements so slow	999
  But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.	999
	999
XLV.	999
	999
The other two, slight air and purging fire,	999
Are both with thee, wherever I abide;	999
The first my thought, the other my desire,	999
These present-absent with swift motion slide.	999
For when these quicker elements are gone	999
In tender embassy of love to thee,	999
My life, being made of four, with two alone	999
Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;	999
Until life's composition be recured	999
By those swift messengers return'd from thee,	999
Who even but now come back again, assured	999
Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:	999
  This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,	999
  I send them back again and straight grow sad.	999
	999
XLVI.	999
	999
Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war	999
How to divide the conquest of thy sight;	999
Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,	999
My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.	999
My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--	999
A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--	999
But the defendant doth that plea deny	999
And says in him thy fair appearance lies.	999
To 'cide this title is impanneled	999
A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,	999
And by their verdict is determined	999
The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:	999
  As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,	999
  And my heart's right thy inward love of heart.	999
	999
XLVII.	999
	999
Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,	999
And each doth good turns now unto the other:	999
When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,	999
Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,	999
With my love's picture then my eye doth feast	999
And to the painted banquet bids my heart;	999
Another time mine eye is my heart's guest	999
And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:	999
So, either by thy picture or my love,	999
Thyself away art resent still with me;	999
For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,	999
And I am still with them and they with thee;	999
  Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight	999
  Awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight.	999
	999
XLVIII.	999
	999
How careful was I, when I took my way,	999
Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,	999
That to my use it might unused stay	999
From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!	999
But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,	999
Most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief,	999
Thou, best of dearest and mine only care,	999
Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.	999
Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,	999
Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,	999
Within the gentle closure of my breast,	999
From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;	999
  And even thence thou wilt be stol'n, I fear,	999
  For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.	999
	999
XLIX.	999
	999
Against that time, if ever that time come,	999
When I shall see thee frown on my defects,	999
When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,	999
Call'd to that audit by advised respects;	999
Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass	999
And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,	999
When love, converted from the thing it was,	999
Shall reasons find of settled gravity,--	999
Against that time do I ensconce me here	999
Within the knowledge of mine own desert,	999
And this my hand against myself uprear,	999
To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:	999
  To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,	999
  Since why to love I can allege no cause.	999
	999
L.	999
	999
How heavy do I journey on the way,	999
When what I seek, my weary travel's end,	999
Doth teach that ease and that repose to say	999
'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'	999
The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,	999
Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,	999
As if by some instinct the wretch did know	999
His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:	999
The bloody spur cannot provoke him on	999
That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide;	999
Which heavily he answers with a groan,	999
More sharp to me than spurring to his side;	999
  For that same groan doth put this in my mind;	999
  My grief lies onward and my joy behind.	999
	999
LI.	999
	999
Thus can my love excuse the slow offence	999
Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:	999
From where thou art why should I haste me thence?	999
Till I return, of posting is no need.	999
O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,	999
When swift extremity can seem but slow?	999
Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;	999
In winged speed no motion shall I know:	999
Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;	999
Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made,	999
Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;	999
But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;	999
  Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,	999
  Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.	999
	999
LII.	999
	999
So am I as the rich, whose blessed key	999
Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,	999
The which he will not every hour survey,	999
For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.	999
Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,	999
Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,	999
Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,	999
Or captain jewels in the carcanet.	999
So is the time that keeps you as my chest,	999
Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,	999
To make some special instant special blest,	999
By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.	999
  Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,	999
  Being had, to triumph, being lack'd, to hope.	999
	999
LIII.	999
	999
What is your substance, whereof are you made,	999
That millions of strange shadows on you tend?	999
Since every one hath, every one, one shade,	999
And you, but one, can every shadow lend.	999
Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit	999
Is poorly imitated after you;	999
On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,	999
And you in Grecian tires are painted new:	999
Speak of the spring and foison of the year;	999
The one doth shadow of your beauty show,	999
The other as your bounty doth appear;	999
And you in every blessed shape we know.	999
  In all external grace you have some part,	999
  But you like none, none you, for constant heart.	999
	999
LIV.	999
	999
O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem	999
By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!	999
The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem	999
For that sweet odour which doth in it live.	999
The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye	999
As the perfumed tincture of the roses,	999
Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly	999
When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:	999
But, for their virtue only is their show,	999
They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade,	999
Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;	999
Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:	999
  And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,	999
  When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.	999
	999
LV.	999
	999
Not marble, nor the gilded monuments	999
Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;	999
But you shall shine more bright in these contents	999
Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time.	999
When wasteful war shall statues overturn,	999
And broils root out the work of masonry,	999
Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn	999
The living record of your memory.	999
'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity	999
Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room	999
Even in the eyes of all posterity	999
That wear this world out to the ending doom.	999
  So, till the judgment that yourself arise,	999
  You live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes.	999
	999
LVI.	999
	999
Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said	999
Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,	999
Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,	999
To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:	999
So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill	999
Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,	999
To-morrow see again, and do not kill	999
The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.	999
Let this sad interim like the ocean be	999
Which parts the shore, where two contracted new	999
Come daily to the banks, that, when they see	999
Return of love, more blest may be the view;	999
  Else call it winter, which being full of care	999
  Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare.	999
	999
LVII.	999
	999
Being your slave, what should I do but tend	999
Upon the hours and times of your desire?	999
I have no precious time at all to spend,	999
Nor services to do, till you require.	999
Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour	999
Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,	999
Nor think the bitterness of absence sour	999
When you have bid your servant once adieu;	999
Nor dare I question with my jealous thought	999
Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,	999
But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought	999
Save, where you are how happy you make those.	999
  So true a fool is love that in your will,	999
  Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.	999
	999
LVIII.	999
	999
That god forbid that made me first your slave,	999
I should in thought control your times of pleasure,	999
Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,	999
Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!	999
O, let me suffer, being at your beck,	999
The imprison'd absence of your liberty;	999
And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each cheque,	999
Without accusing you of injury.	999
Be where you list, your charter is so strong	999
That you yourself may privilege your time	999
To what you will; to you it doth belong	999
Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.	999
  I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;	999
  Not blame your pleasure, be it ill or well.	999
	999
LIX.	999
	999
If there be nothing new, but that which is	999
Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,	999
Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss	999
The second burden of a former child!	999
O, that record could with a backward look,	999
Even of five hundred courses of the sun,	999
Show me your image in some antique book,	999
Since mind at first in character was done!	999
That I might see what the old world could say	999
To this composed wonder of your frame;	999
Whether we are mended, or whether better they,	999
Or whether revolution be the same.	999
  O, sure I am, the wits of former days	999
  To subjects worse have given admiring praise.	999
	999
LX.	999
	999
Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,	999
So do our minutes hasten to their end;	999
Each changing place with that which goes before,	999
In sequent toil all forwards do contend.	999
Nativity, once in the main of light,	999
Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,	999
Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,	999
And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.	999
Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth	999
And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,	999
Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,	999
And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:	999
  And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,	999
  Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.	999
	999
LXI.	999
	999
Is it thy will thy image should keep open	999
My heavy eyelids to the weary night?	999
Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,	999
While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?	999
Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee	999
So far from home into my deeds to pry,	999
To find out shames and idle hours in me,	999
The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?	999
O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:	999
It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;	999
Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,	999
To play the watchman ever for thy sake:	999
  For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,	999
  From me far off, with others all too near.	999
	999
LXII.	999
	999
Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye	999
And all my soul and all my every part;	999
And for this sin there is no remedy,	999
It is so grounded inward in my heart.	999
Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,	999
No shape so true, no truth of such account;	999
And for myself mine own worth do define,	999
As I all other in all worths surmount.	999
But when my glass shows me myself indeed,	999
Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity,	999
Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;	999
Self so self-loving were iniquity.	999
  'Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,	999
  Painting my age with beauty of thy days.	999
	999
LXIII.	999
	999
Against my love shall be, as I am now,	999
With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'er-worn;	999
When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow	999
With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn	999
Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night,	999
And all those beauties whereof now he's king	999
Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,	999
Stealing away the treasure of his spring;	999
For such a time do I now fortify	999
Against confounding age's cruel knife,	999
That he shall never cut from memory	999
My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:	999
  His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,	999
  And they shall live, and he in them still green.	999
	999
LXIV.	999
	999
When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced	999
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;	999
When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed	999
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;	999
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain	999
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,	999
And the firm soil win of the watery main,	999
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;	999
When I have seen such interchange of state,	999
Or state itself confounded to decay;	999
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,	999
That Time will come and take my love away.	999
  This thought is as a death, which cannot choose	999
  But weep to have that which it fears to lose.	999
	999
LXV.	999
	999
Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,	999
But sad mortality o'er-sways their power,	999
How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,	999
Whose action is no stronger than a flower?	999
O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out	999
Against the wreckful siege of battering days,	999
When rocks impregnable are not so stout,	999
Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?	999
O fearful meditation! where, alack,	999
Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?	999
Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?	999
Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?	999
  O, none, unless this miracle have might,	999
  That in black ink my love may still shine bright.	999
	999
LXVI.	999
	999
Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,	999
As, to behold desert a beggar born,	999
And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,	999
And purest faith unhappily forsworn,	999
And guilded honour shamefully misplaced,	999
And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,	999
And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,	999
And strength by limping sway disabled,	999
And art made tongue-tied by authority,	999
And folly doctor-like controlling skill,	999
And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,	999
And captive good attending captain ill:	999
  Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,	999
  Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.	999
	999
LXVII.	999
	999
Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,	999
And with his presence grace impiety,	999
That sin by him advantage should achieve	999
And lace itself with his society?	999
Why should false painting imitate his cheek	999
And steal dead seeing of his living hue?	999
Why should poor beauty indirectly seek	999
Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?	999
Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,	999
Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?	999
For she hath no exchequer now but his,	999
And, proud of many, lives upon his gains.	999
  O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had	999
  In days long since, before these last so bad.	999
	999
LXVIII.	999
	999
Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,	999
When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,	999
Before the bastard signs of fair were born,	999
Or durst inhabit on a living brow;	999
Before the golden tresses of the dead,	999
The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,	999
To live a second life on second head;	999
Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:	999
In him those holy antique hours are seen,	999
Without all ornament, itself and true,	999
Making no summer of another's green,	999
Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;	999
  And him as for a map doth Nature store,	999
  To show false Art what beauty was of yore.	999
	999
LXIX.	999
	999
Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view	999
Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;	999
All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,	999
Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.	999
Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;	999
But those same tongues that give thee so thine own	999
In other accents do this praise confound	999
By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.	999
They look into the beauty of thy mind,	999
And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;	999
Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,	999
To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:	999
  But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,	999
  The solve is this, that thou dost common grow.	999
	999
LXX.	999
	999
That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,	999
For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;	999
The ornament of beauty is suspect,	999
A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.	999
So thou be good, slander doth but approve	999
Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;	999
For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,	999
And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.	999
Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,	999
Either not assail'd or victor being charged;	999
Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,	999
To tie up envy evermore enlarged:	999
  If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,	999
  Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.	999
	999
LXXI.	999
	999
No longer mourn for me when I am dead	999
Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell	999
Give warning to the world that I am fled	999
From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:	999
Nay, if you read this line, remember not	999
The hand that writ it; for I love you so	999
That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot	999
If thinking on me then should make you woe.	999
O, if, I say, you look upon this verse	999
When I perhaps compounded am with clay,	999
Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.	999
But let your love even with my life decay,	999
  Lest the wise world should look into your moan	999
  And mock you with me after I am gone.	999
	999
LXXII.	999
	999
O, lest the world should task you to recite	999
What merit lived in me, that you should love	999
After my death, dear love, forget me quite,	999
For you in me can nothing worthy prove;	999
Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,	999
To do more for me than mine own desert,	999
And hang more praise upon deceased I	999
Than niggard truth would willingly impart:	999
O, lest your true love may seem false in this,	999
That you for love speak well of me untrue,	999
My name be buried where my body is,	999
And live no more to shame nor me nor you.	999
  For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,	999
  And so should you, to love things nothing worth.	999
	999
LXXIII.	999
	999
That time of year thou mayst in me behold	999
When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang	999
Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,	999
Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.	999
In me thou seest the twilight of such day	999
As after sunset fadeth in the west,	999
Which by and by black night doth take away,	999
Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.	999
In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire	999
That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,	999
As the death-bed whereon it must expire	999
Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.	999
  This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,	999
  To love that well which thou must leave ere long.	999
	999
LXXIV.	999
	999
But be contented: when that fell arrest	999
Without all bail shall carry me away,	999
My life hath in this line some interest,	999
Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.	999
When thou reviewest this, thou dost review	999
The very part was consecrate to thee:	999
The earth can have but earth, which is his due;	999
My spirit is thine, the better part of me:	999
So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,	999
The prey of worms, my body being dead,	999
The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,	999
Too base of thee to be remembered.	999
  The worth of that is that which it contains,	999
  And that is this, and this with thee remains.	999
	999
LXXV.	999
	999
So are you to my thoughts as food to life,	999
Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;	999
And for the peace of you I hold such strife	999
As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;	999
Now proud as an enjoyer and anon	999
Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,	999
Now counting best to be with you alone,	999
Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;	999
Sometime all full with feasting on your sight	999
And by and by clean starved for a look;	999
Possessing or pursuing no delight,	999
Save what is had or must from you be took.	999
  Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,	999
  Or gluttoning on all, or all away.	999
	999
LXXVI.	999
	999
Why is my verse so barren of new pride,	999
So far from variation or quick change?	999
Why with the time do I not glance aside	999
To new-found methods and to compounds strange?	999
Why write I still all one, ever the same,	999
And keep invention in a noted weed,	999
That every word doth almost tell my name,	999
Showing their birth and where they did proceed?	999
O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,	999
And you and love are still my argument;	999
So all my best is dressing old words new,	999
Spending again what is already spent:	999
  For as the sun is daily new and old,	999
  So is my love still telling what is told.	999
	999
LXXVII.	999
	999
Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,	999
Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;	999
The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,	999
And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.	999
The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show	999
Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;	999
Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know	999
Time's thievish progress to eternity.	999
Look, what thy memory can not contain	999
Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find	999
Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,	999
To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.	999
  These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,	999
  Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.	999
	999
LXXVIII.	999
	999
So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse	999
And found such fair assistance in my verse	999
As every alien pen hath got my use	999
And under thee their poesy disperse.	999
Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing	999
And heavy ignorance aloft to fly	999
Have added feathers to the learned's wing	999
And given grace a double majesty.	999
Yet be most proud of that which I compile,	999
Whose influence is thine and born of thee:	999
In others' works thou dost but mend the style,	999
And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;	999
  But thou art all my art and dost advance	999
  As high as learning my rude ignorance.	999
	999
LXXIX.	999
	999
Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,	999
My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,	999
But now my gracious numbers are decay'd	999
And my sick Muse doth give another place.	999
I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument	999
Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,	999
Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent	999
He robs thee of and pays it thee again.	999
He lends thee virtue and he stole that word	999
From thy behavior; beauty doth he give	999
And found it in thy cheek; he can afford	999
No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.	999
  Then thank him not for that which he doth say,	999
  Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.	999
	999
LXXX.	999
	999
O, how I faint when I of you do write,	999
Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,	999
And in the praise thereof spends all his might,	999
To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!	999
But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,	999
The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,	999
My saucy bark inferior far to his	999
On your broad main doth wilfully appear.	999
Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,	999
Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;	999
Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,	999
He of tall building and of goodly pride:	999
  Then if he thrive and I be cast away,	999
  The worst was this; my love was my decay.	999
	999
LXXXI.	999
	999
Or I shall live your epitaph to make,	999
Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;	999
From hence your memory death cannot take,	999
Although in me each part will be forgotten.	999
Your name from hence immortal life shall have,	999
Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:	999
The earth can yield me but a common grave,	999
When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.	999
Your monument shall be my gentle verse,	999
Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,	999
And tongues to be your being shall rehearse	999
When all the breathers of this world are dead;	999
  You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--	999
  Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.	999
	999
LXXXII.	999
	999
I grant thou wert not married to my Muse	999
And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook	999
The dedicated words which writers use	999
Of their fair subject, blessing every book	999
Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,	999
Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,	999
And therefore art enforced to seek anew	999
Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days	999
And do so, love; yet when they have devised	999
What strained touches rhetoric can lend,	999
Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized	999
In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;	999
  And their gross painting might be better used	999
  Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.	999
	999
LXXXIII.	999
	999
I never saw that you did painting need	999
And therefore to your fair no painting set;	999
I found, or thought I found, you did exceed	999
The barren tender of a poet's debt;	999
And therefore have I slept in your report,	999
That you yourself being extant well might show	999
How far a modern quill doth come too short,	999
Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.	999
This silence for my sin you did impute,	999
Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;	999
For I impair not beauty being mute,	999
When others would give life and bring a tomb.	999
  There lives more life in one of your fair eyes	999
  Than both your poets can in praise devise.	999
	999
LXXXIV.	999
	999
Who is it that says most? which can say more	999
Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?	999
In whose confine immured is the store	999
Which should example where your equal grew.	999
Lean penury within that pen doth dwell	999
That to his subject lends not some small glory;	999
But he that writes of you, if he can tell	999
That you are you, so dignifies his story,	999
Let him but copy what in you is writ,	999
Not making worse what nature made so clear,	999
And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,	999
Making his style admired every where.	999
  You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,	999
  Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.	999
	999
LXXXV.	999
	999
My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,	999
While comments of your praise, richly compiled,	999
Reserve their character with golden quill	999
And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.	999
I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,	999
And like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen'	999
To every hymn that able spirit affords	999
In polish'd form of well-refined pen.	999
Hearing you praised, I say ''Tis so, 'tis true,'	999
And to the most of praise add something more;	999
But that is in my thought, whose love to you,	999
Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.	999
  Then others for the breath of words respect,	999
  Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.	999
	999
LXXXVI.	999
	999
Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,	999
Bound for the prize of all too precious you,	999
That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,	999
Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?	999
Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write	999
Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?	999
No, neither he, nor his compeers by night	999
Giving him aid, my verse astonished.	999
He, nor that affable familiar ghost	999
Which nightly gulls him with intelligence	999
As victors of my silence cannot boast;	999
I was not sick of any fear from thence:	999
  But when your countenance fill'd up his line,	999
  Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.	999
	999
LXXXVII.	999
	999
Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,	999
And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:	999
The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;	999
My bonds in thee are all determinate.	999
For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?	999
And for that riches where is my deserving?	999
The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,	999
And so my patent back again is swerving.	999
Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,	999
Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;	999
So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,	999
Comes home again, on better judgment making.	999
  Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,	999
  In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.	999
	999
LXXXVIII.	999
	999
When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,	999
And place my merit in the eye of scorn,	999
Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,	999
And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.	999
With mine own weakness being best acquainted,	999
Upon thy part I can set down a story	999
Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,	999
That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:	999
And I by this will be a gainer too;	999
For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,	999
The injuries that to myself I do,	999
Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.	999
  Such is my love, to thee I so belong,	999
  That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.	999
	999
LXXXIX.	999
	999
Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,	999
And I will comment upon that offence;	999
Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,	999
Against thy reasons making no defence.	999
Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,	999
To set a form upon desired change,	999
As I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,	999
I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,	999
Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue	999
Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,	999
Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong	999
And haply of our old acquaintance tell.	999
  For thee against myself I'll vow debate,	999
  For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.	999
	999
XC.	999
	999
Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;	999
Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,	999
Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,	999
And do not drop in for an after-loss:	999
Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,	999
Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;	999
Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,	999
To linger out a purposed overthrow.	999
If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,	999
When other petty griefs have done their spite	999
But in the onset come; so shall I taste	999
At first the very worst of fortune's might,	999
  And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,	999
  Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.	999
	999
XCI.	999
	999
Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,	999
Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,	999
Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,	999
Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;	999
And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,	999
Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:	999
But these particulars are not my measure;	999
All these I better in one general best.	999
Thy love is better than high birth to me,	999
Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,	999
Of more delight than hawks or horses be;	999
And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:	999
  Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take	999
  All this away and me most wretched make.	999
	999
XCII.	999
	999
But do thy worst to steal thyself away,	999
For term of life thou art assured mine,	999
And life no longer than thy love will stay,	999
For it depends upon that love of thine.	999
Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,	999
When in the least of them my life hath end.	999
I see a better state to me belongs	999
Than that which on thy humour doth depend;	999
Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,	999
Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.	999
O, what a happy title do I find,	999
Happy to have thy love, happy to die!	999
  But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?	999
  Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.	999
	999
XCIII.	999
	999
So shall I live, supposing thou art true,	999
Like a deceived husband; so love's face	999
May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;	999
Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:	999
For there can live no hatred in thine eye,	999
Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.	999
In many's looks the false heart's history	999
Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,	999
But heaven in thy creation did decree	999
That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;	999
Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,	999
Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.	999
  How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,	999
  if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!	999
	999
XCIV.	999
	999
They that have power to hurt and will do none,	999
That do not do the thing they most do show,	999
Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,	999
Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,	999
They rightly do inherit heaven's graces	999
And husband nature's riches from expense;	999
They are the lords and owners of their faces,	999
Others but stewards of their excellence.	999
The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,	999
Though to itself it only live and die,	999
But if that flower with base infection meet,	999
The basest weed outbraves his dignity:	999
  For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;	999
  Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.	999
	999
XCV.	999
	999
How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame	999
Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,	999
Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!	999
O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!	999
That tongue that tells the story of thy days,	999
Making lascivious comments on thy sport,	999
Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;	999
Naming thy name blesses an ill report.	999
O, what a mansion have those vices got	999
Which for their habitation chose out thee,	999
Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,	999
And all things turn to fair that eyes can see!	999
  Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;	999
  The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.	999
	999
XCVI.	999
	999
Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;	999
Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;	999
Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;	999
Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort.	999
As on the finger of a throned queen	999
The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,	999
So are those errors that in thee are seen	999
To truths translated and for true things deem'd.	999
How many lambs might the stem wolf betray,	999
If like a lamb he could his looks translate!	999
How many gazers mightst thou lead away,	999
If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!	999
  But do not so; I love thee in such sort	999
  As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.	999
	999
XCVII.	999
	999
How like a winter hath my absence been	999
From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!	999
What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!	999
What old December's bareness every where!	999
And yet this time removed was summer's time,	999
The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,	999
Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,	999
Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:	999
Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me	999
But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;	999
For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,	999
And, thou away, the very birds are mute;	999
  Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer	999
  That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.	999
	999
XCVIII.	999
	999
From you have I been absent in the spring,	999
When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim	999
Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,	999
That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.	999
Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell	999
Of different flowers in odour and in hue	999
Could make me any summer's story tell,	999
Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;	999
Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,	999
Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;	999
They were but sweet, but figures of delight,	999
Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.	999
  Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,	999
  As with your shadow I with these did play:	999
	999
XCIX.	999
	999
The forward violet thus did I chide:	999
Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,	999
If not from my love's breath? The purple pride	999
Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells	999
In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.	999
The lily I condemned for thy hand,	999
And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:	999
The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,	999
One blushing shame, another white despair;	999
A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both	999
And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;	999
But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth	999
A vengeful canker eat him up to death.	999
  More flowers I noted, yet I none could see	999
  But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee.	999
	999
C.	999
	999
Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long	999
To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?	999
Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,	999
Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?	999
Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem	999
In gentle numbers time so idly spent;	999
Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem	999
And gives thy pen both skill and argument.	999
Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,	999
If Time have any wrinkle graven there;	999
If any, be a satire to decay,	999
And make Time's spoils despised every where.	999
  Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;	999
  So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.	999
	999
CI.	999
	999
O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends	999
For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?	999
Both truth and beauty on my love depends;	999
So dost thou too, and therein dignified.	999
Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say	999
'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;	999
Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;	999
But best is best, if never intermix'd?'	999
Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?	999
Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee	999
To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,	999
And to be praised of ages yet to be.	999
  Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how	999
  To make him seem long hence as he shows now.	999
	999
CII.	999
	999
My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;	999
I love not less, though less the show appear:	999
That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming	999
The owner's tongue doth publish every where.	999
Our love was new and then but in the spring	999
When I was wont to greet it with my lays,	999
As Philomel in summer's front doth sing	999
And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:	999
Not that the summer is less pleasant now	999
Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,	999
But that wild music burthens every bough	999
And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.	999
  Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,	999
  Because I would not dull you with my song.	999
	999
CIII.	999
	999
Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,	999
That having such a scope to show her pride,	999
The argument all bare is of more worth	999
Than when it hath my added praise beside!	999
O, blame me not, if I no more can write!	999
Look in your glass, and there appears a face	999
That over-goes my blunt invention quite,	999
Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.	999
Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,	999
To mar the subject that before was well?	999
For to no other pass my verses tend	999
Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;	999
  And more, much more, than in my verse can sit	999
  Your own glass shows you when you look in it.	999
	999
CIV.	999
	999
To me, fair friend, you never can be old,	999
For as you were when first your eye I eyed,	999
Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold	999
Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,	999
Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd	999
In process of the seasons have I seen,	999
Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,	999
Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.	999
Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,	999
Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;	999
So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,	999
Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:	999
  For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;	999
  Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.	999
	999
CV.	999
	999
Let not my love be call'd idolatry,	999
Nor my beloved as an idol show,	999
Since all alike my songs and praises be	999
To one, of one, still such, and ever so.	999
Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,	999
Still constant in a wondrous excellence;	999
Therefore my verse to constancy confined,	999
One thing expressing, leaves out difference.	999
'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,	999
'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words;	999
And in this change is my invention spent,	999
Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.	999
  'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,	999
  Which three till now never kept seat in one.	999
	999
CVI.	999
	999
When in the chronicle of wasted time	999
I see descriptions of the fairest wights,	999
And beauty making beautiful old rhyme	999
In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,	999
Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,	999
Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,	999
I see their antique pen would have express'd	999
Even such a beauty as you master now.	999
So all their praises are but prophecies	999
Of this our time, all you prefiguring;	999
And, for they look'd but with divining eyes,	999
They had not skill enough your worth to sing:	999
  For we, which now behold these present days,	999
  Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.	999
	999
CVII.	999
	999
Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul	999
Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,	999
Can yet the lease of my true love control,	999
Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.	999
The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured	999
And the sad augurs mock their own presage;	999
Incertainties now crown themselves assured	999
And peace proclaims olives of endless age.	999
Now with the drops of this most balmy time	999
My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,	999
Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,	999
While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:	999
  And thou in this shalt find thy monument,	999
  When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.	999
	999
CVIII.	999
	999
What's in the brain that ink may character	999
Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?	999
What's new to speak, what new to register,	999
That may express my love or thy dear merit?	999
Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,	999
I must, each day say o'er the very same,	999
Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,	999
Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.	999
So that eternal love in love's fresh case	999
Weighs not the dust and injury of age,	999
Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,	999
But makes antiquity for aye his page,	999
  Finding the first conceit of love there bred	999
  Where time and outward form would show it dead.	999
	999
CIX.	999
	999
O, never say that I was false of heart,	999
Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.	999
As easy might I from myself depart	999
As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:	999
That is my home of love: if I have ranged,	999
Like him that travels I return again,	999
Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,	999
So that myself bring water for my stain.	999
Never believe, though in my nature reign'd	999
All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,	999
That it could so preposterously be stain'd,	999
To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;	999
  For nothing this wide universe I call,	999
  Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.	999
	999
CX.	999
	999
Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there	999
And made myself a motley to the view,	999
Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,	999
Made old offences of affections new;	999
Most true it is that I have look'd on truth	999
Askance and strangely: but, by all above,	999
These blenches gave my heart another youth,	999
And worse essays proved thee my best of love.	999
Now all is done, have what shall have no end:	999
Mine appetite I never more will grind	999
On newer proof, to try an older friend,	999
A god in love, to whom I am confined.	999
  Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,	999
  Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.	999
	999
CXI.	999
	999
O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,	999
The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,	999
That did not better for my life provide	999
Than public means which public manners breeds.	999
Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,	999
And almost thence my nature is subdued	999
To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:	999
Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;	999
Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink	999
Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection	999
No bitterness that I will bitter think,	999
Nor double penance, to correct correction.	999
  Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye	999
  Even that your pity is enough to cure me.	999
	999
CXII.	999
	999
Your love and pity doth the impression fill	999
Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;	999
For what care I who calls me well or ill,	999
So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?	999
You are my all the world, and I must strive	999
To know my shames and praises from your tongue:	999
None else to me, nor I to none alive,	999
That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.	999
In so profound abysm I throw all care	999
Of others' voices, that my adder's sense	999
To critic and to flatterer stopped are.	999
Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:	999
  You are so strongly in my purpose bred	999
  That all the world besides methinks are dead.	999
	999
CXIII.	999
	999
Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;	999
And that which governs me to go about	999
Doth part his function and is partly blind,	999
Seems seeing, but effectually is out;	999
For it no form delivers to the heart	999
Of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:	999
Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,	999
Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:	999
For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,	999
The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,	999
The mountain or the sea, the day or night,	999
The crow or dove, it shapes them to your feature:	999
  Incapable of more, replete with you,	999
  My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.	999
	999
CXIV.	999
	999
Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,	999
Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?	999
Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,	999
And that your love taught it this alchemy,	999
To make of monsters and things indigest	999
Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,	999
Creating every bad a perfect best,	999
As fast as objects to his beams assemble?	999
O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,	999
And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:	999
Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,	999
And to his palate doth prepare the cup:	999
  If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin	999
  That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.	999
	999
CXV.	999
	999
Those lines that I before have writ do lie,	999
Even those that said I could not love you dearer:	999
Yet then my judgment knew no reason why	999
My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.	999
But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents	999
Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,	999
Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,	999
Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;	999
Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,	999
Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'	999
When I was certain o'er incertainty,	999
Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?	999
  Love is a babe; then might I not say so,	999
  To give full growth to that which still doth grow?	999
	999
CXVI.	999
	999
Let me not to the marriage of true minds	999
Admit impediments. Love is not love	999
Which alters when it alteration finds,	999
Or bends with the remover to remove:	999
O no! it is an ever-fixed mark	999
That looks on tempests and is never shaken;	999
It is the star to every wandering bark,	999
Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.	999
Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks	999
Within his bending sickle's compass come:	999
Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,	999
But bears it out even to the edge of doom.	999
  If this be error and upon me proved,	999
  I never writ, nor no man ever loved.	999
	999
CXVII.	999
	999
Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all	999
Wherein I should your great deserts repay,	999
Forgot upon your dearest love to call,	999
Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;	999
That I have frequent been with unknown minds	999
And given to time your own dear-purchased right	999
That I have hoisted sail to all the winds	999
Which should transport me farthest from your sight.	999
Book both my wilfulness and errors down	999
And on just proof surmise accumulate;	999
Bring me within the level of your frown,	999
But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;	999
  Since my appeal says I did strive to prove	999
  The constancy and virtue of your love.	999
	999
CXVIII.	999
	999
Like as, to make our appetites more keen,	999
With eager compounds we our palate urge,	999
As, to prevent our maladies unseen,	999
We sicken to shun sickness when we purge,	999
Even so, being tuff of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,	999
To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding	999
And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness	999
To be diseased ere that there was true needing.	999
Thus policy in love, to anticipate	999
The ills that were not, grew to faults assured	999
And brought to medicine a healthful state	999
Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:	999
  But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,	999
  Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.	999
	999
CXIX.	999
	999
What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,	999
Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,	999
Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,	999
Still losing when I saw myself to win!	999
What wretched errors hath my heart committed,	999
Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!	999
How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted	999
In the distraction of this madding fever!	999
O benefit of ill! now I find true	999
That better is by evil still made better;	999
And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,	999
Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.	999
  So I return rebuked to my content	999
  And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.	999
	999
CXX.	999
	999
That you were once unkind befriends me now,	999
And for that sorrow which I then did feel	999
Needs must I under my transgression bow,	999
Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.	999
For if you were by my unkindness shaken	999
As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time,	999
And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken	999
To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.	999
O, that our night of woe might have remember'd	999
My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,	999
And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd	999
The humble slave which wounded bosoms fits!	999
  But that your trespass now becomes a fee;	999
  Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.	999
	999
CXXI.	999
	999
'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,	999
When not to be receives reproach of being,	999
And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd	999
Not by our feeling but by others' seeing:	999
For why should others false adulterate eyes	999
Give salutation to my sportive blood?	999
Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,	999
Which in their wills count bad what I think good?	999
No, I am that I am, and they that level	999
At my abuses reckon up their own:	999
I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;	999
By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;	999
  Unless this general evil they maintain,	999
  All men are bad, and in their badness reign.	999
	999
CXXII.	999
	999
Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain	999
Full character'd with lasting memory,	999
Which shall above that idle rank remain	999
Beyond all date, even to eternity;	999
Or at the least, so long as brain and heart	999
Have faculty by nature to subsist;	999
Till each to razed oblivion yield his part	999
Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.	999
That poor retention could not so much hold,	999
Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;	999
Therefore to give them from me was I bold,	999
To trust those tables that receive thee more:	999
  To keep an adjunct to remember thee	999
  Were to import forgetfulness in me.	999
	999
CXXIII.	999
	999
No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:	999
Thy pyramids built up with newer might	999
To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;	999
They are but dressings of a former sight.	999
Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire	999
What thou dost foist upon us that is old,	999
And rather make them born to our desire	999
Than think that we before have heard them told.	999
Thy registers and thee I both defy,	999
Not wondering at the present nor the past,	999
For thy records and what we see doth lie,	999
Made more or less by thy continual haste.	999
  This I do vow and this shall ever be;	999
  I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.	999
	999
CXXIV.	999
	999
If my dear love were but the child of state,	999
It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd'	999
As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,	999
Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.	999
No, it was builded far from accident;	999
It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls	999
Under the blow of thralled discontent,	999
Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls:	999
It fears not policy, that heretic,	999
Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,	999
But all alone stands hugely politic,	999
That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers.	999
  To this I witness call the fools of time,	999
  Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.	999
	999
CXXV.	999
	999
Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,	999
With my extern the outward honouring,	999
Or laid great bases for eternity,	999
Which prove more short than waste or ruining?	999
Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour	999
Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,	999
For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,	999
Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?	999
No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,	999
And take thou my oblation, poor but free,	999
Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,	999
But mutual render, only me for thee.	999
  Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul	999
  When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.	999
	999
CXXVI.	999
	999
O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power	999
Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;	999
Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st	999
Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;	999
If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,	999
As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,	999
She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill	999
May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.	999
Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!	999
She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:	999
  Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,	999
  And her quietus is to render thee.	999
	999
CXXVII.	999
	999
In the old age black was not counted fair,	999
Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;	999
But now is black beauty's successive heir,	999
And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:	999
For since each hand hath put on nature's power,	999
Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,	999
Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,	999
But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.	999
Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,	999
Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem	999
At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,	999
Slandering creation with a false esteem:	999
  Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,	999
  That every tongue says beauty should look so.	999
	999
CXXVIII.	999
	999
How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,	999
Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds	999
With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently sway'st	999
The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,	999
Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap	999
To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,	999
Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,	999
At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!	999
To be so tickled, they would change their state	999
And situation with those dancing chips,	999
O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,	999
Making dead wood more blest than living lips.	999
  Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,	999
  Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.	999
	999
CXXIX.	999
	999
The expense of spirit in a waste of shame	999
Is lust in action; and till action, lust	999
Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,	999
Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,	999
Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight,	999
Past reason hunted, and no sooner had	999
Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait	999
On purpose laid to make the taker mad;	999
Mad in pursuit and in possession so;	999
Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;	999
A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;	999
Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.	999
  All this the world well knows; yet none knows well	999
  To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.	999
	999
CXXX.	999
	999
My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;	999
Coral is far more red than her lips' red;	999
If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;	999
If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.	999
I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,	999
But no such roses see I in her cheeks;	999
And in some perfumes is there more delight	999
Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.	999
I love to hear her speak, yet well I know	999
That music hath a far more pleasing sound;	999
I grant I never saw a goddess go;	999
My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:	999
  And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare	999
  As any she belied with false compare.	999
	999
CXXXI.	999
	999
Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,	999
As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;	999
For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart	999
Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.	999
Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold	999
Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:	999
To say they err I dare not be so bold,	999
Although I swear it to myself alone.	999
And, to be sure that is not false I swear,	999
A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,	999
One on another's neck, do witness bear	999
Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.	999
  In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,	999
  And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.	999
	999
CXXXII.	999
	999
Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,	999
Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,	999
Have put on black and loving mourners be,	999
Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.	999
And truly not the morning sun of heaven	999
Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,	999
Nor that full star that ushers in the even	999
Doth half that glory to the sober west,	999
As those two mourning eyes become thy face:	999
O, let it then as well beseem thy heart	999
To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,	999
And suit thy pity like in every part.	999
  Then will I swear beauty herself is black	999
  And all they foul that thy complexion lack.	999
	999
CXXXIII.	999
	999
Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan	999
For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!	999
Is't not enough to torture me alone,	999
But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?	999
Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,	999
And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:	999
Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;	999
A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.	999
Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,	999
But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;	999
Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;	999
Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:	999
  And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,	999
  Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.	999
	999
CXXXIV.	999
	999
So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,	999
And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,	999
Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine	999
Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:	999
But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,	999
For thou art covetous and he is kind;	999
He learn'd but surety-like to write for me	999
Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.	999
The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,	999
Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,	999
And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;	999
So him I lose through my unkind abuse.	999
  Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:	999
  He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.	999
	999
CXXXV.	999
	999
Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'	999
And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in overplus;	999
More than enough am I that vex thee still,	999
To thy sweet will making addition thus.	999
Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,	999
Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?	999
Shall will in others seem right gracious,	999
And in my will no fair acceptance shine?	999
The sea all water, yet receives rain still	999
And in abundance addeth to his store;	999
So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'	999
One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more.	999
  Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;	999
  Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'	999
	999
CXXXVI.	999
	999
If thy soul cheque thee that I come so near,	999
Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'	999
And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;	999
Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.	999
'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,	999
Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.	999
In things of great receipt with ease we prove	999
Among a number one is reckon'd none:	999
Then in the number let me pass untold,	999
Though in thy stores' account I one must be;	999
For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold	999
That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:	999
  Make but my name thy love, and love that still,	999
  And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'	999
	999
CXXXVII.	999
	999
Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,	999
That they behold, and see not what they see?	999
They know what beauty is, see where it lies,	999
Yet what the best is take the worst to be.	999
If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks	999
Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,	999
Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,	999
Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?	999
Why should my heart think that a several plot	999
Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?	999
Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,	999
To put fair truth upon so foul a face?	999
  In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,	999
  And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.	999
	999
CXXXVIII.	999
	999
When my love swears that she is made of truth	999
I do believe her, though I know she lies,	999
That she might think me some untutor'd youth,	999
Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.	999
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,	999
Although she knows my days are past the best,	999
Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:	999
On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.	999
But wherefore says she not she is unjust?	999
And wherefore say not I that I am old?	999
O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,	999
And age in love loves not to have years told:	999
  Therefore I lie with her and she with me,	999
  And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.	999
	999
CXXXIX.	999
	999
O, call not me to justify the wrong	999
That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;	999
Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;	999
Use power with power and slay me not by art.	999
Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,	999
Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:	999
What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might	999
Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?	999
Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows	999
Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,	999
And therefore from my face she turns my foes,	999
That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:	999
  Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,	999
  Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.	999
	999
CXL.	999
	999
Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press	999
My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;	999
Lest sorrow lend me words and words express	999
The manner of my pity-wanting pain.	999
If I might teach thee wit, better it were,	999
Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;	999
As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,	999
No news but health from their physicians know;	999
For if I should despair, I should grow mad,	999
And in my madness might speak ill of thee:	999
Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,	999
Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,	999
  That I may not be so, nor thou belied,	999
  Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.	999
	999
CXLI.	999
	999
In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,	999
For they in thee a thousand errors note;	999
But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,	999
Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;	999
Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,	999
Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,	999
Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited	999
To any sensual feast with thee alone:	999
But my five wits nor my five senses can	999
Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,	999
Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,	999
Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:	999
  Only my plague thus far I count my gain,	999
  That she that makes me sin awards me pain.	999
	999
CXLII.	999
	999
Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,	999
Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:	999
O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,	999
And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;	999
Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,	999
That have profaned their scarlet ornaments	999
And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,	999
Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.	999
Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those	999
Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:	999
Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows	999
Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.	999
  If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,	999
  By self-example mayst thou be denied!	999
	999
CXLIII.	999
	999
Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch	999
One of her feather'd creatures broke away,	999
Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch	999
In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,	999
Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,	999
Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent	999
To follow that which flies before her face,	999
Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;	999
So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,	999
Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;	999
But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,	999
And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:	999
  So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'	999
  If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.	999
	999
CXLIV.	999
	999
Two loves I have of comfort and despair,	999
Which like two spirits do suggest me still:	999
The better angel is a man right fair,	999
The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.	999
To win me soon to hell, my female evil	999
Tempteth my better angel from my side,	999
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,	999
Wooing his purity with her foul pride.	999
And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend	999
Suspect I may, but not directly tell;	999
But being both from me, both to each friend,	999
I guess one angel in another's hell:	999
  Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,	999
  Till my bad angel fire my good one out.	999
	999
CXLV.	999
	999
Those lips that Love's own hand did make	999
Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'	999
To me that languish'd for her sake;	999
But when she saw my woeful state,	999
Straight in her heart did mercy come,	999
Chiding that tongue that ever sweet	999
Was used in giving gentle doom,	999
And taught it thus anew to greet:	999
'I hate' she alter'd with an end,	999
That follow'd it as gentle day	999
Doth follow night, who like a fiend	999
From heaven to hell is flown away;	999
  'I hate' from hate away she threw,	999
  And saved my life, saying 'not you.'	999
	999
CXLVI.	999
	999
Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,	999
[         ] these rebel powers that thee array;	999
Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,	999
Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?	999
Why so large cost, having so short a lease,	999
Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?	999
Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,	999
Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?	999
Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,	999
And let that pine to aggravate thy store;	999
Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;	999
Within be fed, without be rich no more:	999
  So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,	999
  And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.	999
	999
CXLVII.	999
	999
My love is as a fever, longing still	999
For that which longer nurseth the disease,	999
Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,	999
The uncertain sickly appetite to please.	999
My reason, the physician to my love,	999
Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,	999
Hath left me, and I desperate now approve	999
Desire is death, which physic did except.	999
Past cure I am, now reason is past care,	999
And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;	999
My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,	999
At random from the truth vainly express'd;	999
  For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,	999
  Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.	999
	999
CXLVIII.	999
	999
O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,	999
Which have no correspondence with true sight!	999
Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,	999
That censures falsely what they see aright?	999
If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,	999
What means the world to say it is not so?	999
If it be not, then love doth well denote	999
Love's eye is not so true as all men's 'No.'	999
How can it? O, how can Love's eye be true,	999
That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?	999
No marvel then, though I mistake my view;	999
The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.	999
  O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,	999
  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.	999
	999
CXLIX.	999
	999
Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,	999
When I against myself with thee partake?	999
Do I not think on thee, when I forgot	999
Am of myself, all tyrant, for thy sake?	999
Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?	999
On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?	999
Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend	999
Revenge upon myself with present moan?	999
What merit do I in myself respect,	999
That is so proud thy service to despise,	999
When all my best doth worship thy defect,	999
Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?	999
  But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;	999
  Those that can see thou lovest, and I am blind.	999
	999
CL.	999
	999
O, from what power hast thou this powerful might	999
With insufficiency my heart to sway?	999
To make me give the lie to my true sight,	999
And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?	999
Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,	999
That in the very refuse of thy deeds	999
There is such strength and warrantize of skill	999
That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?	999
Who taught thee how to make me love thee more	999
The more I hear and see just cause of hate?	999
O, though I love what others do abhor,	999
With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:	999
  If thy unworthiness raised love in me,	999
  More worthy I to be beloved of thee.	999
	999
CLI.	999
	999
Love is too young to know what conscience is;	999
Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?	999
Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,	999
Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:	999
For, thou betraying me, I do betray	999
My nobler part to my gross body's treason;	999
My soul doth tell my body that he may	999
Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;	999
But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee	999
As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,	999
He is contented thy poor drudge to be,	999
To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.	999
  No want of conscience hold it that I call	999
  Her 'love' for whose dear love I rise and fall.	999
	999
CLII.	999
	999
In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,	999
But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,	999
In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,	999
In vowing new hate after new love bearing.	999
But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,	999
When I break twenty? I am perjured most;	999
For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee	999
And all my honest faith in thee is lost,	999
For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,	999
Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,	999
And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,	999
Or made them swear against the thing they see;	999
  For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,	999
  To swear against the truth so foul a lie!	999
	999
CLIII.	999
	999
Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:	999
A maid of Dian's this advantage found,	999
And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep	999
In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;	999
Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love	999
A dateless lively heat, still to endure,	999
And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove	999
Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.	999
But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,	999
The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;	999
I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,	999
And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,	999
  But found no cure: the bath for my help lies	999
  Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.	999
	999
CLIV.	999
	999
The little Love-god lying once asleep	999
Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,	999
Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep	999
Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand	999
The fairest votary took up that fire	999
Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;	999
And so the general of hot desire	999
Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.	999
This brand she quenched in a cool well by,	999
Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,	999
Growing a bath and healthful remedy	999
For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,	999
  Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,	999
  Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.	999

RIGHT HONORABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLY,	999
EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON, AND BARON OF TICHFIELD.	999
RIGHT HONORABLE,	999
	999
I KNOW not how I shall offend in dedicating my	999
unpolished lines to your lordship, nor how the world will	999
censure me for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a	999
burden only, if your honour seem but pleased, I account	999
myself highly praised, and vow to take advantage of all idle	999
hours, till I have honoured you with some graver labour. But if	999
the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I shall be	999
sorry it had so noble a god-father, and never after ear so	999
barren a land, for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest.	999
I leave it to your honourable survey, and your honour to your	999
heart's content; which I wish may always answer your own wish	999
and the world's hopeful expectation.	999
	999
Your honour's in all duty,	999
WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.	999
	999
	999
	999
EVEN as the sun with purple-colour'd face	999
Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn,	999
Rose-cheek'd Adonis hied him to the chase;	999
Hunting he loved, but love he laugh'd to scorn;	999
Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,	999
And like a bold-faced suitor 'gins to woo him.	999
	999
'Thrice-fairer than myself,' thus she began,	999
'The field's chief flower, sweet above compare,	999
Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,	999
More white and red than doves or roses are;	999
Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,	999
Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.	999
	999
'Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,	999
And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;	999
If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed	999
A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know:	999
Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,	999
And being set, I'll smother thee with kisses;	999
	999
'And yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety,	999
But rather famish them amid their plenty,	999
Making them red and pale with fresh variety,	999
Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:	999
A summer's day will seem an hour but short,	999
Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.'	999
	999
With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,	999
The precedent of pith and livelihood,	999
And trembling in her passion, calls it balm,	999
Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:	999
Being so enraged, desire doth lend her force	999
Courageously to pluck him from his horse.	999
	999
Over one arm the lusty courser's rein,	999
Under her other was the tender boy,	999
Who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain,	999
With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;	999
She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,	999
He red for shame, but frosty in desire.	999
	999
The studded bridle on a ragged bough	999
Nimbly she fastens:--O, how quick is love!--	999
The steed is stalled up, and even now	999
To tie the rider she begins to prove:	999
Backward she push'd him, as she would be thrust,	999
And govern'd him in strength, though not in lust.	999
	999
So soon was she along as he was down,	999
Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:	999
Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,	999
And 'gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips;	999
And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,	999
'If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.'	999
	999
He burns with bashful shame: she with her tears	999
Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;	999
Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs	999
To fan and blow them dry again she seeks:	999
He saith she is immodest, blames her 'miss;	999
What follows more she murders with a kiss.	999
	999
Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,	999
Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,	999
Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,	999
Till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone;	999
Even so she kissed his brow, his cheek, his chin,	999
And where she ends she doth anew begin.	999
	999
Forced to content, but never to obey,	999
Panting he lies and breatheth in her face;	999
She feedeth on the steam as on a prey,	999
And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace;	999
Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers,	999
So they were dew'd with such distilling showers.	999
	999
Look, how a bird lies tangled in a net,	999
So fasten'd in her arms Adonis lies;	999
Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,	999
Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:	999
Rain added to a river that is rank	999
Perforce will force it overflow the bank.	999
	999
Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,	999
For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale;	999
Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,	999
'Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale:	999
Being red, she loves him best; and being white,	999
Her best is better'd with a more delight.	999
	999
Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;	999
And by her fair immortal hand she swears,	999
From his soft bosom never to remove,	999
Till he take truce with her contending tears,	999
Which long have rain'd, making her cheeks all wet;	999
And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.	999
	999
Upon this promise did he raise his chin,	999
Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,	999
Who, being look'd on, ducks as quickly in;	999
So offers he to give what she did crave;	999
But when her lips were ready for his pay,	999
He winks, and turns his lips another way.	999
	999
Never did passenger in summer's heat	999
More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.	999
Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;	999
She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:	999
'O, pity,' 'gan she cry, 'flint-hearted boy!	999
'Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?	999
	999
'I have been woo'd, as I entreat thee now,	999
Even by the stern and direful god of war,	999
Whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow,	999
Who conquers where he comes in every jar;	999
Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,	999
And begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have.	999
	999
'Over my altars hath he hung his lance,	999
His batter'd shield, his uncontrolled crest,	999
And for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance,	999
To toy, to wanton, dally, smile and jest,	999
Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red,	999
Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.	999
	999
'Thus he that overruled I oversway'd,	999
Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain:	999
Strong-tempered steel his stronger strength obey'd,	999
Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.	999
O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,	999
For mastering her that foil'd the god of fight!	999
	999
'Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine,--	999
Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red--	999
The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine.	999
What seest thou in the ground? hold up thy head:	999
Look in mine eye-balls, there thy beauty lies;	999
Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?	999
'Art thou ashamed to kiss? then wink again,	999
And I will wink; so shall the day seem night;	999
Love keeps his revels where they are but twain;	999
Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight:	999
These blue-vein'd violets whereon we lean	999
Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.	999
	999
'The tender spring upon thy tempting lip	999
Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted:	999
Make use of time, let not advantage slip;	999
Beauty within itself should not be wasted:	999
Fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime	999
Rot and consume themselves in little time.	999
	999
'Were I hard-favour'd, foul, or wrinkled-old,	999
Ill-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,	999
O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold,	999
Thick-sighted, barren, lean and lacking juice,	999
Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee	999
But having no defects, why dost abhor me?	999
	999
'Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow;	999
Mine eyes are gray and bright and quick in turning:	999
My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,	999
My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning;	999
My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,	999
Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.	999
	999
'Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,	999
Or, like a fairy, trip upon the green,	999
Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,	999
Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:	999
Love is a spirit all compact of fire,	999
Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.	999
	999
'Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie;	999
These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;	999
Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,	999
From morn till night, even where I list to sport me:	999
Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be	999
That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?	999
	999
'Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?	999
Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?	999
Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,	999
Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft.	999
Narcissus so himself himself forsook,	999
And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.	999
	999
'Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,	999
Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,	999
Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear:	999
Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse:	999
Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty;	999
Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.	999
	999
'Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed,	999
Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?	999
By law of nature thou art bound to breed,	999
That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;	999
And so, in spite of death, thou dost survive,	999
In that thy likeness still is left alive.'	999
	999
By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,	999
For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,	999
And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat,	999
With burning eye did hotly overlook them;	999
Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,	999
So he were like him and by Venus' side.	999
	999
And now Adonis, with a lazy spright,	999
And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,	999
His louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight,	999
Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,	999
Souring his cheeks cries 'Fie, no more of love!	999
The sun doth burn my face: I must remove.'	999
	999
'Ay me,' quoth Venus, 'young, and so unkind?	999
What bare excuses makest thou to be gone!	999
I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind	999
Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:	999
I'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;	999
If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.	999
	999
'The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,	999
And, lo, I lie between that sun and thee:	999
The heat I have from thence doth little harm,	999
Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me;	999
And were I not immortal, life were done	999
Between this heavenly and earthly sun.	999
	999
'Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel,	999
Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth?	999
Art thou a woman's son, and canst not feel	999
What 'tis to love? how want of love tormenteth?	999
O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind,	999
She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.	999
	999
'What am I, that thou shouldst contemn me this?	999
Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?	999
What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?	999
Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:	999
Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again,	999
And one for interest, if thou wilt have twain.	999
	999
'Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,	999
Well-painted idol, image dun and dead,	999
Statue contenting but the eye alone,	999
Thing like a man, but of no woman bred!	999
Thou art no man, though of a man's complexion,	999
For men will kiss even by their own direction.'	999
	999
This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,	999
And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;	999
Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth he wrong;	999
Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause:	999
And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,	999
And now her sobs do her intendments break.	999
	999
Sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand,	999
Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;	999
Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:	999
She would, he will not in her arms be bound;	999
And when from thence he struggles to be gone,	999
She locks her lily fingers one in one.	999
	999
'Fondling,' she saith, 'since I have hemm'd thee here	999
Within the circuit of this ivory pale,	999
I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;	999
Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:	999
Graze on my lips; and if those hills be dry,	999
Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.	999
	999
Within this limit is relief enough,	999
Sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain,	999
Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,	999
To shelter thee from tempest and from rain	999
Then be my deer, since I am such a park;	999
No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.'	999
	999
At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,	999
That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple:	999
Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,	999
He might be buried in a tomb so simple;	999
Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,	999
Why, there Love lived and there he could not die.	999
	999
These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,	999
Open'd their mouths to swallow Venus' liking.	999
Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?	999
Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?	999
Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,	999
To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!	999
	999
Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?	999
Her words are done, her woes are more increasing;	999
The time is spent, her object will away,	999
And from her twining arms doth urge releasing.	999
'Pity,' she cries, 'some favour, some remorse!'	999
Away he springs and hasteth to his horse.	999
	999
But, lo, from forth a copse that neighbors by,	999
A breeding jennet, lusty, young and proud,	999
Adonis' trampling courser doth espy,	999
And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:	999
The strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,	999
Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.	999
	999
Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,	999
And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;	999
The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,	999
Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;	999
The iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth,	999
Controlling what he was controlled with.	999
	999
His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane	999
Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;	999
His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,	999
As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:	999
His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,	999
Shows his hot courage and his high desire.	999
	999
Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,	999
With gentle majesty and modest pride;	999
Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,	999
As who should say 'Lo, thus my strength is tried,	999
And this I do to captivate the eye	999
Of the fair breeder that is standing by.'	999
	999
What recketh he his rider's angry stir,	999
His flattering 'Holla,' or his 'Stand, I say'?	999
What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?	999
For rich caparisons or trapping gay?	999
He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,	999
For nothing else with his proud sight agrees.	999
	999
Look, when a painter would surpass the life,	999
In limning out a well-proportion'd steed,	999
His art with nature's workmanship at strife,	999
As if the dead the living should exceed;	999
So did this horse excel a common one	999
In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.	999
	999
Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,	999
Broad breast, full eye, small head and nostril wide,	999
High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,	999
Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:	999
Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,	999
Save a proud rider on so proud a back.	999
	999
Sometime he scuds far off and there he stares;	999
Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;	999
To bid the wind a base he now prepares,	999
And whether he run or fly they know not whether;	999
For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,	999
Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.	999
	999
He looks upon his love and neighs unto her;	999
She answers him as if she knew his mind:	999
Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,	999
She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,	999
Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,	999
Beating his kind embracements with her heels.	999
	999
Then, like a melancholy malcontent,	999
He veils his tail that, like a falling plume,	999
Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:	999
He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.	999
His love, perceiving how he is enraged,	999
Grew kinder, and his fury was assuaged.	999
	999
His testy master goeth about to take him;	999
When, lo, the unback'd breeder, full of fear,	999
Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,	999
With her the horse, and left Adonis there:	999
As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,	999
Out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.	999
	999
All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,	999
Banning his boisterous and unruly beast:	999
And now the happy season once more fits,	999
That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest;	999
For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong	999
When it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue.	999
	999
An oven that is stopp'd, or river stay'd,	999
Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:	999
So of concealed sorrow may be said;	999
Free vent of words love's fire doth assuage;	999
But when the heart's attorney once is mute,	999
The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.	999
	999
He sees her coming, and begins to glow,	999
Even as a dying coal revives with wind,	999
And with his bonnet hides his angry brow;	999
Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,	999
Taking no notice that she is so nigh,	999
For all askance he holds her in his eye.	999
	999
O, what a sight it was, wistly to view	999
How she came stealing to the wayward boy!	999
To note the fighting conflict of her hue,	999
How white and red each other did destroy!	999
But now her cheek was pale, and by and by	999
It flash'd forth fire, as lightning from the sky.	999
	999
Now was she just before him as he sat,	999
And like a lowly lover down she kneels;	999
With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,	999
Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:	999
His tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print,	999
As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.	999
	999
O, what a war of looks was then between them!	999
Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing;	999
His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them;	999
Her eyes woo'd still, his eyes disdain'd the wooing:	999
And all this dumb play had his acts made plain	999
With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain.	999
	999
Full gently now she takes him by the hand,	999
A lily prison'd in a gaol of snow,	999
Or ivory in an alabaster band;	999
So white a friend engirts so white a foe:	999
This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,	999
Show'd like two silver doves that sit a-billing.	999
	999
Once more the engine of her thoughts began:	999
'O fairest mover on this mortal round,	999
Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,	999
My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound;	999
For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,	999
Though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee!	999
	999
'Give me my hand,' saith he, 'why dost thou feel it?'	999
'Give me my heart,' saith she, 'and thou shalt have it:	999
O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,	999
And being steel'd, soft sighs can never grave it:	999
Then love's deep groans I never shall regard,	999
Because Adonis' heart hath made mine hard.'	999
	999
'For shame,' he cries, 'let go, and let me go;	999
My day's delight is past, my horse is gone,	999
And 'tis your fault I am bereft him so:	999
I pray you hence, and leave me here alone;	999
For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,	999
Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.'	999
	999
Thus she replies: 'Thy palfrey, as he should,	999
Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire:	999
Affection is a coal that must be cool'd;	999
Else, suffer'd, it will set the heart on fire:	999
The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;	999
Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.	999
	999
'How like a jade he stood, tied to the tree,	999
Servilely master'd with a leathern rein!	999
But when he saw his love, his youth's fair fee,	999
He held such petty bondage in disdain;	999
Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,	999
Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.	999
	999
'Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,	999
Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,	999
But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,	999
His other agents aim at like delight?	999
Who is so faint, that dare not be so bold	999
To touch the fire, the weather being cold?	999
	999
'Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;	999
And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,	999
To take advantage on presented joy;	999
Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee;	999
O, learn to love; the lesson is but plain,	999
And once made perfect, never lost again.'	999
	999
I know not love,' quoth he, 'nor will not know it,	999
Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;	999
'Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;	999
My love to love is love but to disgrace it;	999
For I have heard it is a life in death,	999
That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.	999
	999
'Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd?	999
Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?	999
If springing things be any jot diminish'd,	999
They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth:	999
The colt that's back'd and burden'd being young	999
Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong.	999
	999
'You hurt my hand with wringing; let us part,	999
And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:	999
Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;	999
To love's alarms it will not ope the gate:	999
Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery;	999
For where a heart is hard they make no battery.'	999
	999
'What! canst thou talk?' quoth she, 'hast thou a tongue?	999
O, would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing!	999
Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;	999
I had my load before, now press'd with bearing:	999
Melodious discord, heavenly tune harshsounding,	999
Ear's deep-sweet music, and heart's deep-sore wounding.	999
	999
'Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love	999
That inward beauty and invisible;	999
Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move	999
Each part in me that were but sensible:	999
Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,	999
Yet should I be in love by touching thee.	999
	999
'Say, that the sense of feeling were bereft me,	999
And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch,	999
And nothing but the very smell were left me,	999
Yet would my love to thee be still as much;	999
For from the stillitory of thy face excelling	999
Comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by	999
smelling.	999
	999
'But, O, what banquet wert thou to the taste,	999
Being nurse and feeder of the other four!	999
Would they not wish the feast might ever last,	999
And bid Suspicion double-lock the door,	999
Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,	999
Should, by his stealing in, disturb the feast?'	999
	999
Once more the ruby-colour'd portal open'd,	999
Which to his speech did honey passage yield;	999
Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken'd	999
Wreck to the seaman, tempest to the field,	999
Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,	999
Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.	999
	999
This ill presage advisedly she marketh:	999
Even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth,	999
Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,	999
Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,	999
Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,	999
His meaning struck her ere his words begun.	999
	999
And at his look she flatly falleth down,	999
For looks kill love and love by looks reviveth;	999
A smile recures the wounding of a frown;	999
But blessed bankrupt, that by love so thriveth!	999
The silly boy, believing she is dead,	999
Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;	999
	999
And all amazed brake off his late intent,	999
For sharply he did think to reprehend her,	999
Which cunning love did wittily prevent:	999
Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!	999
For on the grass she lies as she were slain,	999
Till his breath breatheth life in her again.	999
	999
He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,	999
He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,	999
He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks	999
To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd:	999
He kisses her; and she, by her good will,	999
Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.	999
	999
The night of sorrow now is turn'd to day:	999
Her two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,	999
Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array	999
He cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth;	999
And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,	999
So is her face illumined with her eye;	999
	999
Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd,	999
As if from thence they borrow'd all their shine.	999
Were never four such lamps together mix'd,	999
Had not his clouded with his brow's repine;	999
But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light,	999
Shone like the moon in water seen by night.	999
	999
'O, where am I?' quoth she, 'in earth or heaven,	999
Or in the ocean drench'd, or in the fire?	999
What hour is this? or morn or weary even?	999
Do I delight to die, or life desire?	999
But now I lived, and life was death's annoy;	999
But now I died, and death was lively joy.	999
	999
'O, thou didst kill me: kill me once again:	999
Thy eyes' shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,	999
Hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain	999
That they have murder'd this poor heart of mine;	999
And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,	999
But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.	999
	999
'Long may they kiss each other, for this cure!	999
O, never let their crimson liveries wear!	999
And as they last, their verdure still endure,	999
To drive infection from the dangerous year!	999
That the star-gazers, having writ on death,	999
May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.	999
	999
'Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,	999
What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?	999
To sell myself I can be well contented,	999
So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing;	999
Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips	999
Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.	999
	999
'A thousand kisses buys my heart from me;	999
And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.	999
What is ten hundred touches unto thee?	999
Are they not quickly told and quickly gone?	999
Say, for non-payment that the debt should double,	999
Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?	999
	999
'Fair queen,' quoth he, 'if any love you owe me,	999
Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:	999
Before I know myself, seek not to know me;	999
No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:	999
The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,	999
Or being early pluck'd is sour to taste.	999
	999
'Look, the world's comforter, with weary gait,	999
His day's hot task hath ended in the west;	999
The owl, night's herald, shrieks, ''Tis very late;'	999
The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,	999
And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven's light	999
Do summon us to part and bid good night.	999
	999
'Now let me say 'Good night,' and so say you;	999
If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.'	999
'Good night,' quoth she, and, ere he says 'Adieu,'	999
The honey fee of parting tender'd is:	999
Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;	999
Incorporate then they seem; face grows to face.	999
	999
Till, breathless, he disjoin'd, and backward drew	999
The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,	999
Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,	999
Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth:	999
He with her plenty press'd, she faint with dearth	999
Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.	999
	999
Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,	999
And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;	999
Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,	999
Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;	999
Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,	999
That she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry:	999
	999
And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,	999
With blindfold fury she begins to forage;	999
Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,	999
And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage,	999
Planting oblivion, beating reason back,	999
Forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack.	999
	999
Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,	999
Like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling,	999
Or as the fleet-foot roe that's tired with chasing,	999
Or like the froward infant still'd with dandling,	999
He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,	999
While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.	999
	999
What wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering,	999
And yields at last to every light impression?	999
Things out of hope are compass'd oft with venturing,	999
Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission:	999
Affection faints not like a pale-faced coward,	999
But then woos best when most his choice is froward.	999
	999
When he did frown, O, had she then gave over,	999
Such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd.	999
Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;	999
What though the rose have prickles, yet 'tis pluck'd:	999
Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,	999
Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.	999
	999
For pity now she can no more detain him;	999
The poor fool prays her that he may depart:	999
She is resolved no longer to restrain him;	999
Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart,	999
The which, by Cupid's bow she doth protest,	999
He carries thence incaged in his breast.	999
	999
'Sweet boy,' she says, 'this night I'll waste in sorrow,	999
For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch.	999
Tell me, Love's master, shall we meet to-morrow?	999
Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?'	999
He tells her, no; to-morrow he intends	999
To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.	999
	999
'The boar!' quoth she; whereat a sudden pale,	999
Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,	999
Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,	999
And on his neck her yoking arms she throws:	999
She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,	999
He on her belly falls, she on her back.	999
	999
Now is she in the very lists of love,	999
Her champion mounted for the hot encounter:	999
All is imaginary she doth prove,	999
He will not manage her, although he mount her;	999
That worse than Tantalus' is her annoy,	999
To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.	999
	999
Even as poor birds, deceived with painted grapes,	999
Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,	999
Even so she languisheth in her mishaps,	999
As those poor birds that helpless berries saw.	999
The warm effects which she in him finds missing	999
She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.	999
	999
But all in vain; good queen, it will not be:	999
She hath assay'd as much as may be proved;	999
Her pleading hath deserved a greater fee;	999
She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not loved.	999
'Fie, fie,' he says, 'you crush me; let me go;	999
You have no reason to withhold me so.'	999
	999
'Thou hadst been gone,' quoth she, 'sweet boy, ere this,	999
But that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.	999
O, be advised! thou know'st not what it is	999
With javelin's point a churlish swine to gore,	999
Whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still,	999
Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill.	999
	999
'On his bow-back he hath a battle set	999
Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;	999
His eyes, like glow-worms, shine when he doth fret;	999
His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;	999
Being moved, he strikes whate'er is in his way,	999
And whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay.	999
	999
'His brawny sides, with hairy bristles arm'd,	999
Are better proof than thy spear's point can enter;	999
His short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd;	999
Being ireful, on the lion he will venture:	999
The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,	999
As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.	999
	999
'Alas, he nought esteems that face of thine,	999
To which Love's eyes pay tributary gazes;	999
Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips and crystal eyne,	999
Whose full perfection all the world amazes;	999
But having thee at vantage,--wondrous dread!--	999
Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.	999
	999
'O, let him keep his loathsome cabin still;	999
Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends:	999
Come not within his danger by thy will;	999
They that thrive well take counsel of their friends.	999
When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,	999
I fear'd thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.	999
	999
'Didst thou not mark my face? was it not white?	999
Saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?	999
Grew I not faint? and fell I not downright?	999
Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,	999
My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,	999
But, like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.	999
	999
'For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy	999
Doth call himself Affection's sentinel;	999
Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,	999
And in a peaceful hour doth cry 'Kill, kill!'	999
Distempering gentle Love in his desire,	999
As air and water do abate the fire.	999
	999
'This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,	999
This canker that eats up Love's tender spring,	999
This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy,	999
That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,	999
Knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear	999
That if I love thee, I thy death should fear:	999
	999
'And more than so, presenteth to mine eye	999
The picture of an angry-chafing boar,	999
Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie	999
An image like thyself, all stain'd with gore;	999
Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed	999
Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.	999
	999
'What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,	999
That tremble at the imagination?	999
The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,	999
And fear doth teach it divination:	999
I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,	999
If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.	999
	999
'But if thou needs wilt hunt, be ruled by me;	999
Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,	999
Or at the fox which lives by subtlety,	999
Or at the roe which no encounter dare:	999
Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,	999
And on thy well-breath'd horse keep with thy	999
hounds.	999
	999
'And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,	999
Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles	999
How he outruns the wind and with what care	999
He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:	999
The many musets through the which he goes	999
Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.	999
	999
'Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,	999
To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,	999
And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,	999
To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,	999
And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer:	999
Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear:	999
	999
'For there his smell with others being mingled,	999
The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,	999
Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled	999
With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;	999
Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies,	999
As if another chase were in the skies.	999
	999
'By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,	999
Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,	999
To harken if his foes pursue him still:	999
Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;	999
And now his grief may be compared well	999
To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.	999
	999
'Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch	999
Turn, and return, indenting with the way;	999
Each envious brier his weary legs doth scratch,	999
Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:	999
For misery is trodden on by many,	999
And being low never relieved by any.	999
	999
'Lie quietly, and hear a little more;	999
Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:	999
To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,	999
Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,	999
Applying this to that, and so to so;	999
For love can comment upon every woe.	999
	999
'Where did I leave?' 'No matter where,' quoth he,	999
'Leave me, and then the story aptly ends:	999
The night is spent.' 'Why, what of that?' quoth she.	999
'I am,' quoth he, 'expected of my friends;	999
And now 'tis dark, and going I shall fall.'	999
'In night,' quoth she, 'desire sees best of all	999
	999
'But if thou fall, O, then imagine this,	999
The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,	999
And all is but to rob thee of a kiss.	999
Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips	999
Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,	999
Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.	999
	999
'Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:	999
Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine,	999
Till forging Nature be condemn'd of treason,	999
For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine;	999
Wherein she framed thee in high heaven's despite,	999
To shame the sun by day and her by night.	999
	999
'And therefore hath she bribed the Destinies	999
To cross the curious workmanship of nature,	999
To mingle beauty with infirmities,	999
And pure perfection with impure defeature,	999
Making it subject to the tyranny	999
Of mad mischances and much misery;	999
	999
'As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,	999
Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood,	999
The marrow-eating sickness, whose attaint	999
Disorder breeds by heating of the blood:	999
Surfeits, imposthumes, grief, and damn'd despair,	999
Swear nature's death for framing thee so fair.	999
	999
'And not the least of all these maladies	999
But in one minute's fight brings beauty under:	999
Both favour, savour, hue and qualities,	999
Whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder,	999
Are on the sudden wasted, thaw'd and done,	999
As mountain-snow melts with the midday sun.	999
	999
'Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity,	999
Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,	999
That on the earth would breed a scarcity	999
And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,	999
Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night	999
Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.	999
	999
'What is thy body but a swallowing grave,	999
Seeming to bury that posterity	999
Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,	999
If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity?	999
If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,	999
Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.	999
	999
'So in thyself thyself art made away;	999
A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,	999
Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,	999
Or butcher-sire that reaves his son of life.	999
Foul-cankering rust the hidden treasure frets,	999
But gold that's put to use more gold begets.'	999
	999
'Nay, then,' quoth Adon, 'you will fall again	999
Into your idle over-handled theme:	999
The kiss I gave you is bestow'd in vain,	999
And all in vain you strive against the stream;	999
For, by this black-faced night, desire's foul nurse,	999
Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.	999
	999
'If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,	999
And every tongue more moving than your own,	999
Bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs,	999
Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown	999
For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear,	999
And will not let a false sound enter there;	999
	999
'Lest the deceiving harmony should run	999
Into the quiet closure of my breast;	999
And then my little heart were quite undone,	999
In his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest.	999
No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,	999
But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.	999
	999
'What have you urged that I cannot reprove?	999
The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger:	999
I hate not love, but your device in love,	999
That lends embracements unto every stranger.	999
You do it for increase: O strange excuse,	999
When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!	999
	999
'Call it not love, for Love to heaven is fled,	999
Since sweating Lust on earth usurp'd his name;	999
Under whose simple semblance he hath fed	999
Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;	999
Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves,	999
As caterpillars do the tender leaves.	999
	999
'Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,	999
But Lust's effect is tempest after sun;	999
Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain,	999
Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done;	999
Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;	999
Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.	999
	999
'More I could tell, but more I dare not say;	999
The text is old, the orator too green.	999
Therefore, in sadness, now I will away;	999
My face is full of shame, my heart of teen:	999
Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended,	999
Do burn themselves for having so offended.'	999
	999
With this, he breaketh from the sweet embrace,	999
Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,	999
And homeward through the dark laund runs apace;	999
Leaves Love upon her back deeply distress'd.	999
Look, how a bright star shooteth from the sky,	999
So glides he in the night from Venus' eye.	999
	999
Which after him she darts, as one on shore	999
Gazing upon a late-embarked friend,	999
Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,	999
Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend:	999
So did the merciless and pitchy night	999
Fold in the object that did feed her sight.	999
	999
Whereat amazed, as one that unaware	999
Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,	999
Or stonish'd as night-wanderers often are,	999
Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood,	999
Even so confounded in the dark she lay,	999
Having lost the fair discovery of her way.	999
	999
And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,	999
That all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled,	999
Make verbal repetition of her moans;	999
Passion on passion deeply is redoubled:	999
'Ay me!' she cries, and twenty times 'Woe, woe!'	999
And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.	999
	999
She marking them begins a wailing note	999
And sings extemporally a woeful ditty;	999
How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;	999
How love is wise in folly, foolish-witty:	999
Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,	999
And still the choir of echoes answer so.	999
	999
Her song was tedious and outwore the night,	999
For lovers' hours are long, though seeming short:	999
If pleased themselves, others, they think, delight	999
In such-like circumstance, with suchlike sport:	999
Their copious stories oftentimes begun	999
End without audience and are never done.	999
	999
For who hath she to spend the night withal	999
But idle sounds resembling parasites,	999
Like shrill-tongued tapsters answering every call,	999
Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?	999
She says ''Tis so:' they answer all ''Tis so;'	999
And would say after her, if she said 'No.'	999
	999
Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest,	999
From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,	999
And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast	999
The sun ariseth in his majesty;	999
Who doth the world so gloriously behold	999
That cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold.	999
	999
Venus salutes him with this fair good-morrow:	999
'O thou clear god, and patron of all light,	999
From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow	999
The beauteous influence that makes him bright,	999
There lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother,	999
May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.'	999
	999
This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,	999
Musing the morning is so much o'erworn,	999
And yet she hears no tidings of her love:	999
She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn:	999
Anon she hears them chant it lustily,	999
And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.	999
	999
And as she runs, the bushes in the way	999
Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,	999
Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:	999
She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,	999
Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,	999
Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.	999
	999
By this, she hears the hounds are at a bay;	999
Whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder	999
Wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way,	999
The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;	999
Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds	999
Appals her senses and her spirit confounds.	999
	999
For now she knows it is no gentle chase,	999
But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,	999
Because the cry remaineth in one place,	999
Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud:	999
Finding their enemy to be so curst,	999
They all strain courtesy who shall cope him first.	999
	999
This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,	999
Through which it enters to surprise her heart;	999
Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,	999
With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part:	999
Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,	999
They basely fly and dare not stay the field.	999
	999
Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy;	999
Till, cheering up her senses all dismay'd,	999
She tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy,	999
And childish error, that they are afraid;	999
Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:--	999
And with that word she spied the hunted boar,	999
	999
Whose frothy mouth, bepainted all with red,	999
Like milk and blood being mingled both together,	999
A second fear through all her sinews spread,	999
Which madly hurries her she knows not whither:	999
This way runs, and now she will no further,	999
But back retires to rate the boar for murther.	999
	999
A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways;	999
She treads the path that she untreads again;	999
Her more than haste is mated with delays,	999
Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,	999
Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting;	999
In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.	999
	999
Here kennell'd in a brake she finds a hound,	999
And asks the weary caitiff for his master,	999
And there another licking of his wound,	999
'Gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster;	999
And here she meets another sadly scowling,	999
To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.	999
	999
When he hath ceased his ill-resounding noise,	999
Another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,	999
Against the welkin volleys out his voice;	999
Another and another answer him,	999
Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,	999
Shaking their scratch'd ears, bleeding as they go.	999
	999
Look, how the world's poor people are amazed	999
At apparitions, signs and prodigies,	999
Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,	999
Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;	999
So she at these sad signs draws up her breath	999
And sighing it again, exclaims on Death.	999
	999
'Hard-favour'd tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,	999
Hateful divorce of love,'--thus chides she Death,--	999
'Grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean	999
To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,	999
Who when he lived, his breath and beauty set	999
Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?	999
	999
'If he be dead,--O no, it cannot be,	999
Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it:--	999
O yes, it may; thou hast no eyes to see,	999
But hatefully at random dost thou hit.	999
Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart	999
Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart.	999
	999
'Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,	999
And, hearing him, thy power had lost his power.	999
The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;	999
They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower:	999
Love's golden arrow at him should have fled,	999
And not Death's ebon dart, to strike dead.	999
	999
'Dost thou drink tears, that thou provokest such weeping?	999
What may a heavy groan advantage thee?	999
Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping	999
Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?	999
Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigour,	999
Since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour.'	999
	999
Here overcome, as one full of despair,	999
She vail'd her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopt	999
The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair	999
In the sweet channel of her bosom dropt;	999
But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,	999
And with his strong course opens them again.	999
	999
O, how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow!	999
Her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;	999
Both crystals, where they view'd each other's sorrow,	999
Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;	999
But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,	999
Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.	999
	999
Variable passions throng her constant woe,	999
As striving who should best become her grief;	999
All entertain'd, each passion labours so,	999
That every present sorrow seemeth chief,	999
But none is best: then join they all together,	999
Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.	999
	999
By this, far off she hears some huntsman hollo;	999
A nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well:	999
The dire imagination she did follow	999
This sound of hope doth labour to expel;	999
For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,	999
And flatters her it is Adonis' voice.	999
	999
Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,	999
Being prison'd in her eye like pearls in glass;	999
Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,	999
Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass,	999
To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,	999
Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd.	999
	999
O hard-believing love, how strange it seems	999
Not to believe, and yet too credulous!	999
Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;	999
Despair and hope makes thee ridiculous:	999
The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,	999
In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.	999
	999
Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;	999
Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame;	999
It was not she that call'd him, all-to naught:	999
Now she adds honours to his hateful name;	999
She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,	999
Imperious supreme of all mortal things.	999
	999
'No, no,' quoth she, 'sweet Death, I did but jest;	999
Yet pardon me I felt a kind of fear	999
When as I met the boar, that bloody beast,	999
Which knows no pity, but is still severe;	999
Then, gentle shadow,--truth I must confess,--	999
I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.	999
	999
''Tis not my fault: the boar provoked my tongue;	999
Be wreak'd on him, invisible commander;	999
'Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;	999
I did but act, he's author of thy slander:	999
Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet	999
Could rule them both without ten women's wit.'	999
	999
Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,	999
Her rash suspect she doth extenuate;	999
And that his beauty may the better thrive,	999
With Death she humbly doth insinuate;	999
Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories	999
His victories, his triumphs and his glories.	999
	999
'O Jove,' quoth she, 'how much a fool was I	999
To be of such a weak and silly mind	999
To wail his death who lives and must not die	999
Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind!	999
For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,	999
And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.	999
	999
'Fie, fie, fond love, thou art so full of fear	999
As one with treasure laden, hemm'd thieves;	999
Trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear,	999
Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.'	999
Even at this word she hears a merry horn,	999
Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.	999
	999
As falcon to the lure, away she flies;	999
The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light;	999
And in her haste unfortunately spies	999
The foul boar's conquest on her fair delight;	999
Which seen, her eyes, as murder'd with the view,	999
Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;	999
	999
Or, as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,	999
Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,	999
And there, all smother'd up, in shade doth sit,	999
Long after fearing to creep forth again;	999
So, at his bloody view, her eyes are fled	999
Into the deep dark cabins of her head:	999
	999
Where they resign their office and their light	999
To the disposing of her troubled brain;	999
Who bids them still consort with ugly night,	999
And never wound the heart with looks again;	999
Who like a king perplexed in his throne,	999
By their suggestion gives a deadly groan,	999
	999
Whereat each tributary subject quakes;	999
As when the wind, imprison'd in the ground,	999
Struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes,	999
Which with cold terror doth men's minds confound.	999
This mutiny each part doth so surprise	999
That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;	999
	999
And, being open'd, threw unwilling light	999
Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd	999
In his soft flank; whose wonted lily white	999
With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench'd:	999
No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,	999
But stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed.	999
	999
This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth;	999
Over one shoulder doth she hang her head;	999
Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;	999
She thinks he could not die, he is not dead:	999
Her voice is stopt, her joints forget to bow;	999
Her eyes are mad that they have wept til now.	999
	999
Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,	999
That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;	999
And then she reprehends her mangling eye,	999
That makes more gashes where no breach should be:	999
His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled;	999
For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.	999
	999
'My tongue cannot express my grief for one,	999
And yet,' quoth she, 'behold two Adons dead!	999
My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,	999
Mine eyes are turn'd to fire, my heart to lead:	999
Heavy heart's lead, melt at mine eyes' red fire!	999
So shall I die by drops of hot desire.	999
	999
'Alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!	999
What face remains alive that's worth the viewing?	999
Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast	999
Of things long since, or any thing ensuing?	999
The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;	999
But true-sweet beauty lived and died with him.	999
	999
'Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!	999
Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:	999
Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;	999
The sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you:	999
But when Adonis lived, sun and sharp air	999
Lurk'd like two thieves, to rob him of his fair:	999
	999
'And therefore would he put his bonnet on,	999
Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;	999
The wind would blow it off and, being gone,	999
Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;	999
And straight, in pity of his tender years,	999
They both would strive who first should dry his tears.	999
	999
'To see his face the lion walk'd along	999
Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;	999
To recreate himself when he hath sung,	999
The tiger would be tame and gently hear him;	999
If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey	999
And never fright the silly lamb that day.	999
	999
'When he beheld his shadow in the brook,	999
The fishes spread on it their golden gills;	999
When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,	999
That some would sing, some other in their bills	999
Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries;	999
He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.	999
	999
'But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar,	999
Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,	999
Ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;	999
Witness the entertainment that he gave:	999
If he did see his face, why then I know	999
He thought to kiss him, and hath kill'd him so.	999
	999
''Tis true, 'tis true; thus was Adonis slain:	999
He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,	999
Who did not whet his teeth at him again,	999
But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;	999
And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine	999
Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.	999
	999
'Had I been tooth'd like him, I must confess,	999
With kissing him I should have kill'd him first;	999
But he is dead, and never did he bless	999
My youth with his; the more am I accurst.'	999
With this, she falleth in the place she stood,	999
And stains her face with his congealed blood.	999
	999
She looks upon his lips, and they are pale;	999
She takes him by the hand, and that is cold;	999
She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,	999
As if they heard the woeful words she told;	999
She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,	999
Where, lo, two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies;	999
	999
Two glasses, where herself herself beheld	999
A thousand times, and now no more reflect;	999
Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell'd,	999
And every beauty robb'd of his effect:	999
'Wonder of time,' quoth she, 'this is my spite,	999
That, thou being dead, the day should yet be light.	999
	999
'Since thou art dead, lo, here I prophesy:	999
Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend:	999
It shall be waited on with jealousy,	999
Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end,	999
Ne'er settled equally, but high or low,	999
That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe.	999
	999
'It shall be fickle, false and full of fraud,	999
Bud and be blasted in a breathing-while;	999
The bottom poison, and the top o'erstraw'd	999
With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile:	999
The strongest body shall it make most weak,	999
Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak.	999
	999
'It shall be sparing and too full of riot,	999
Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;	999
The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,	999
Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;	999
It shall be raging-mad and silly-mild,	999
Make the young old, the old become a child.	999
	999
'It shall suspect where is no cause of fear;	999
It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;	999
It shall be merciful and too severe,	999
And most deceiving when it seems most just;	999
Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward,	999
Put fear to valour, courage to the coward.	999
	999
'It shall be cause of war and dire events,	999
And set dissension 'twixt the son and sire;	999
Subject and servile to all discontents,	999
As dry combustious matter is to fire:	999
Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,	999
They that love best their loves shall not enjoy.'	999
	999
By this, the boy that by her side lay kill'd	999
Was melted like a vapour from her sight,	999
And in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd,	999
A purple flower sprung up, chequer'd with white,	999
Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood	999
Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.	999
	999
She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,	999
Comparing it to her Adonis' breath,	999
And says, within her bosom it shall dwell,	999
Since he himself is reft from her by death:	999
She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears	999
Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.	999
	999
'Poor flower,' quoth she, 'this was thy fathers guise--	999
Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire--	999
For every little grief to wet his eyes:	999
To grow unto himself was his desire,	999
And so 'tis thine; but know, it is as good	999
To wither in my breast as in his blood.	999
	999
'Here was thy father's bed, here in my breast;	999
Thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right:	999
Lo, in this hollow cradle take thy rest,	999
My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:	999
There shall not be one minute in an hour	999
Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower.'	999
	999
Thus weary of the world, away she hies,	999
And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid	999
Their mistress mounted through the empty skies	999
In her light chariot quickly is convey'd;	999
Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen	999
Means to immure herself and not be seen.	999
	999

RIGHT HONORABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLY,	999
Earl of Southampton, and Baron of Tichfield.	999
	999
	999
The love I dedicate to your lordship is without end; whereof	999
this pamphlet, without beginning, is but a superfluous moiety.	999
The warrant I have of your honourable disposition, not the worth	999
of my untutored lines, makes it assured of acceptance. What I	999
have done is yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in	999
all I have, devoted yours. Were my worth greater, my duty would	999
show greater; meantime, as it is, it is bound to your lordship,	999
to whom I wish long life, still lengthened with all happiness.	999

Your lordship's in all duty,	999

	999
	999
	999
	THE RAPE OF LUCRECE	999
	999
	999
	THE ARGUMENT	999
	999
	999
Lucius Tarquinius, for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus,	999
after he had caused his own father-in-law Servius Tullius to be	999
cruelly murdered, and, contrary to the Roman laws and customs,	999
not requiring or staying for the people's suffrages, had	999
possessed himself of the kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons	999
and other noblemen of Rome, to besiege Ardea. During which siege	999
the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of	999
Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son, in their discourses after	999
supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife: among	999
whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife	999
Lucretia. In that pleasant humour they posted to Rome; and	999
intending, by their secret and sudden arrival, to make trial of	999
that which every one had before avouched, only Collatinus finds	999
his wife, though it were late in the night, spinning amongst her	999
maids: the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or	999
in several disports. Whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus	999
the victory, and his wife the fame. At that time Sextus	999
Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece' beauty, yet smothering	999
his passions for the present, departed with the rest back to the	999
camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself, and	999
was, according to his estate, royally entertained and lodged by	999
Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously stealeth	999
into her chamber, violently ravished her, and early in the	999
morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight,	999
hastily dispatcheth messengers, one to Rome for her father,	999
another to the camp for Collatine. They came, the one	999
accompanied with Junius Brutus, the other with Publius Valerius;	999
and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit, demanded the cause	999
of her sorrow. She, first taking an oath of them for her	999
revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his dealing, and	999
withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one consent	999
they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the	999
Tarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted	999
the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed, with a	999
bitter invective against the tyranny of the king: wherewith the	999
people were so moved, that with one consent and a general	999
acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled, and the state	999
government changed from kings to consuls.	999
	999
	999
	999
	THE RAPE OF LUCRECE	999
	999
	999
	999
FROM the besieged Ardea all in post,	999
Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,	999
Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,	999
And to Collatium bears the lightless fire	999
Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire	999
And girdle with embracing flames the waist	999
Of Collatine's fair love, Lucrece the chaste.	999
	999
Haply that name of 'chaste' unhappily set	999
This bateless edge on his keen appetite;	999
When Collatine unwisely did not let	999
To praise the clear unmatched red and white	999
Which triumph'd in that sky of his delight,	999
Where mortal stars, as bright as heaven's beauties,	999
With pure aspects did him peculiar duties.	999
	999
For he the night before, in Tarquin's tent,	999
Unlock'd the treasure of his happy state;	999
What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent	999
In the possession of his beauteous mate;	999
Reckoning his fortune at such high-proud rate,	999
That kings might be espoused to more fame,	999
But king nor peer to such a peerless dame.	999
	999
O happiness enjoy'd but of a few!	999
And, if possess'd, as soon decay'd and done	999
As is the morning's silver-melting dew	999
Against the golden splendor of the sun!	999
An expired date, cancell'd ere well begun:	999
Honour and beauty, in the owner's arms,	999
Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms.	999
	999
Beauty itself doth of itself persuade	999
The eyes of men without an orator;	999
What needeth then apologies be made,	999
To set forth that which is so singular?	999
Or why is Collatine the publisher	999
Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown	999
From thievish ears, because it is his own?	999
	999
Perchance his boast of Lucrece' sovereignty	999
Suggested this proud issue of a king;	999
For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be:	999
Perchance that envy of so rich a thing,	999
Braving compare, disdainfully did sting	999
His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt	999
That golden hap which their superiors want.	999
	999
But some untimely thought did instigate	999
His all-too-timeless speed, if none of those:	999
His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state,	999
Neglected all, with swift intent he goes	999
To quench the coal which in his liver glows.	999
O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,	999
Thy hasty spring still blasts, and ne'er grows old!	999
	999
When at Collatium this false lord arrived,	999
Well was he welcomed by the Roman dame,	999
Within whose face beauty and virtue strived	999
Which of them both should underprop her fame:	999
When virtue bragg'd, beauty would blush for shame;	999
When beauty boasted blushes, in despite	999
Virtue would stain that o'er with silver white.	999
	999
But beauty, in that white intituled,	999
From Venus' doves doth challenge that fair field:	999
Then virtue claims from beauty beauty's red,	999
Which virtue gave the golden age to gild	999
Their silver cheeks, and call'd it then their shield;	999
Teaching them thus to use it in the fight,	999
When shame assail'd, the red should fence the white.	999
	999
This heraldry in Lucrece' face was seen,	999
Argued by beauty's red and virtue's white	999
Of either's colour was the other queen,	999
Proving from world's minority their right:	999
Yet their ambition makes them still to fight;	999
The sovereignty of either being so great,	999
That oft they interchange each other's seat.	999
	999
Their silent war of lilies and of roses,	999
Which Tarquin view'd in her fair face's field,	999
In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses;	999
Where, lest between them both it should be kill'd,	999
The coward captive vanquished doth yield	999
To those two armies that would let him go,	999
Rather than triumph in so false a foe.	999
	999
Now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue,--	999
The niggard prodigal that praised her so,--	999
In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,	999
Which far exceeds his barren skill to show:	999
Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe	999
Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,	999
In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes.	999
	999
This earthly saint, adored by this devil,	999
Little suspecteth the false worshipper;	999
For unstain'd thoughts do seldom dream on evil;	999
Birds never limed no secret bushes fear:	999
So guiltless she securely gives good cheer	999
And reverend welcome to her princely guest,	999
Whose inward ill no outward harm express'd:	999
	999
For that he colour'd with his high estate,	999
Hiding base sin in plaits of majesty;	999
That nothing in him seem'd inordinate,	999
Save something too much wonder of his eye,	999
Which, having all, all could not satisfy;	999
But, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store,	999
That, cloy'd with much, he pineth still for more.	999
	999
But she, that never coped with stranger eyes,	999
Could pick no meaning from their parling looks,	999
Nor read the subtle-shining secrecies	999
Writ in the glassy margents of such books:	999
She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;	999
Nor could she moralize his wanton sight,	999
More than his eyes were open'd to the light.	999
	999
He stories to her ears her husband's fame,	999
Won in the fields of fruitful Italy;	999
And decks with praises Collatine's high name,	999
Made glorious by his manly chivalry	999
With bruised arms and wreaths of victory:	999
Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express,	999
And, wordless, so greets heaven for his success.	999
	999
Far from the purpose of his coming hither,	999
He makes excuses for his being there:	999
No cloudy show of stormy blustering weather	999
Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear;	999
Till sable Night, mother of Dread and Fear,	999
Upon the world dim darkness doth display,	999
And in her vaulty prison stows the Day.	999
	999
For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,	999
Intending weariness with heavy spright;	999
For, after supper, long he questioned	999
With modest Lucrece, and wore out the night:	999
Now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight;	999
And every one to rest themselves betake,	999
Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.	999
	999
As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving	999
The sundry dangers of his will's obtaining;	999
Yet ever to obtain his will resolving,	999
Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining:	999
Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining;	999
And when great treasure is the meed proposed,	999
Though death be adjunct, there's no death supposed.	999
	999
Those that much covet are with gain so fond,	999
For what they have not, that which they possess	999
They scatter and unloose it from their bond,	999
And so, by hoping more, they have but less;	999
Or, gaining more, the profit of excess	999
Is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain,	999
That they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain.	999
	999
The aim of all is but to nurse the life	999
With honour, wealth, and ease, in waning age;	999
And in this aim there is such thwarting strife,	999
That one for all, or all for one we gage;	999
As life for honour in fell battle's rage;	999
Honour for wealth; and oft that wealth doth cost	999
The death of all, and all together lost.	999
	999
So that in venturing ill we leave to be	999
The things we are for that which we expect;	999
And this ambitious foul infirmity,	999
In having much, torments us with defect	999
Of that we have: so then we do neglect	999
The thing we have; and, all for want of wit,	999
Make something nothing by augmenting it.	999
	999
Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,	999
Pawning his honour to obtain his lust;	999
And for himself himself be must forsake:	999
Then where is truth, if there be no self-trust?	999
When shall he think to find a stranger just,	999
When he himself himself confounds, betrays	999
To slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days?	999
	999
Now stole upon the time the dead of night,	999
When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes:	999
No comfortable star did lend his light,	999
No noise but owls' and wolves' death-boding cries;	999
Now serves the season that they may surprise	999
The silly lambs: pure thoughts are dead and still,	999
While lust and murder wake to stain and kill.	999
	999
And now this lustful lord leap'd from his bed,	999
Throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm;	999
Is madly toss'd between desire and dread;	999
Th' one sweetly flatters, th' other feareth harm;	999
But honest fear, bewitch'd with lust's foul charm,	999
Doth too too oft betake him to retire,	999
Beaten away by brain-sick rude desire.	999
	999
His falchion on a flint he softly smiteth,	999
That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly;	999
Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,	999
Which must be lode-star to his lustful eye;	999
And to the flame thus speaks advisedly,	999
'As from this cold flint I enforced this fire,	999
So Lucrece must I force to my desire.'	999
	999
Here pale with fear he doth premeditate	999
The dangers of his loathsome enterprise,	999
And in his inward mind he doth debate	999
What following sorrow may on this arise:	999
Then looking scornfully, he doth despise	999
His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,	999
And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust:	999
	999
'Fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not	999
To darken her whose light excelleth thine:	999
And die, unhallow'd thoughts, before you blot	999
With your uncleanness that which is divine;	999
Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine:	999
Let fair humanity abhor the deed	999
That spots and stains love's modest snow-white weed.	999
	999
'O shame to knighthood and to shining arms!	999
O foul dishonour to my household's grave!	999
O impious act, including all foul harms!	999
A martial man to be soft fancy's slave!	999
True valour still a true respect should have;	999
Then my digression is so vile, so base,	999
That it will live engraven in my face.	999
	999
'Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive,	999
And be an eye-sore in my golden coat;	999
Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,	999
To cipher me how fondly I did dote;	999
That my posterity, shamed with the note	999
Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin	999
To wish that I their father had not bin.	999
	999
'What win I, if I gain the thing I seek?	999
A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy.	999
Who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week?	999
Or sells eternity to get a toy?	999
For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?	999
Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,	999
Would with the sceptre straight be strucken down?	999
	999
'If Collatinus dream of my intent,	999
Will he not wake, and in a desperate rage	999
Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?	999
This siege that hath engirt his marriage,	999
This blur to youth, this sorrow to the sage,	999
This dying virtue, this surviving shame,	999
Whose crime will bear an ever-during blame?	999
	999
'O, what excuse can my invention make,	999
When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed?	999
Will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake,	999
Mine eyes forego their light, my false heart bleed?	999
The guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed;	999
And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,	999
But coward-like with trembling terror die.	999
	999
	999
'Had Collatinus kill'd my son or sire,	999
Or lain in ambush to betray my life,	999
Or were he not my dear friend, this desire	999
Might have excuse to work upon his wife,	999
As in revenge or quittal of such strife:	999
But as he is my kinsman, my dear friend,	999
The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end.	999
	999
'Shameful it is; ay, if the fact be known:	999
Hateful it is; there is no hate in loving:	999
I'll beg her love; but she is own:	999
The worst is but denial and reproving:	999
My will is strong, past reason's weak removing.	999
Who fears a sentence or an old man's saw	999
Shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe.'	999
	999
Thus, graceless, holds he disputation	999
'Tween frozen conscience and hot-burning will,	999
And with good thoughts make dispensation,	999
Urging the worser sense for vantage still;	999
Which in a moment doth confound and kill	999
All pure effects, and doth so far proceed,	999
That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed.	999
	999
Quoth he, 'She took me kindly by the hand,	999
And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes,	999
Fearing some hard news from the warlike band,	999
Where her beloved Collatinus lies.	999
O, how her fear did make her colour rise!	999
First red as roses that on lawn we lay,	999
Then white as lawn, the roses took away.	999
	999
'And how her hand, in my hand being lock'd	999
Forced it to tremble with her loyal fear!	999
Which struck her sad, and then it faster rock'd,	999
Until her husband's welfare she did hear;	999
Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer,	999
That had Narcissus seen her as she stood,	999
Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.	999
	999
'Why hunt I then for colour or excuses?	999
All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth;	999
Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses;	999
Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth:	999
Affection is my captain, and he leadeth;	999
And when his gaudy banner is display'd,	999
The coward fights and will not be dismay'd.	999
	999
'Then, childish fear, avaunt! debating, die!	999
Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!	999
My heart shall never countermand mine eye:	999
Sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage;	999
My part is youth, and beats these from the stage:	999
Desire my pilot is, beauty my prize;	999
Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies?'	999
	999
As corn o'ergrown by weeds, so heedful fear	999
Is almost choked by unresisted lust.	999
Away he steals with open listening ear,	999
Full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust;	999
Both which, as servitors to the unjust,	999
So cross him with their opposite persuasion,	999
That now he vows a league, and now invasion.	999
	999
Within his thought her heavenly image sits,	999
And in the self-same seat sits Collatine:	999
That eye which looks on her confounds his wits;	999
That eye which him beholds, as more divine,	999
Unto a view so false will not incline;	999
But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart,	999
Which once corrupted takes the worser part;	999
	999
And therein heartens up his servile powers,	999
Who, flatter'd by their leader's jocund show,	999
Stuff up his lust, as minutes fill up hours;	999
And as their captain, so their pride doth grow,	999
Paying more slavish tribute than they owe.	999
By reprobate desire thus madly led,	999
The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece' bed.	999
	999
The locks between her chamber and his will,	999
Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;	999
But, as they open, they all rate his ill,	999
Which drives the creeping thief to some regard:	999
The threshold grates the door to have him heard;	999
Night-wandering weasels shriek to see him there;	999
They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear.	999
	999
As each unwilling portal yields him way,	999
Through little vents and crannies of the place	999
The wind wars with his torch to make him stay,	999
And blows the smoke of it into his face,	999
Extinguishing his conduct in this case;	999
But his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch,	999
Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch:	999
	999
And being lighted, by the light he spies	999
Lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks:	999
He takes it from the rushes where it lies,	999
And griping it, the needle his finger pricks;	999
As who should say 'This glove to wanton tricks	999
Is not inured; return again in haste;	999
Thou see'st our mistress' ornaments are chaste.'	999
	999
But all these poor forbiddings could not stay him;	999
He in the worst sense construes their denial:	999
The doors, the wind, the glove, that did delay him,	999
He takes for accidental things of trial;	999
Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial,	999
Who with a lingering slay his course doth let,	999
Till every minute pays the hour his debt.	999
	999
'So, so,' quoth he, 'these lets attend the time,	999
Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,	999
To add a more rejoicing to the prime,	999
And give the sneaped birds more cause to sing.	999
Pain pays the income of each precious thing;	999
Huge rocks, high winds, strong pirates, shelves and sands,	999
The merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands.'	999
	999
Now is he come unto the chamber-door,	999
That shuts him from the heaven of his thought,	999
Which with a yielding latch, and with no more,	999
Hath barr'd him from the blessed thing be sought.	999
So from himself impiety hath wrought,	999
That for his prey to pray he doth begin,	999
As if the heavens should countenance his sin.	999
	999
But in the midst of his unfruitful prayer,	999
Having solicited th' eternal power	999
That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair,	999
And they would stand auspicious to the hour,	999
Even there he starts: quoth he, 'I must deflower:	999
The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact,	999
How can they then assist me in the act?	999
	999
'Then Love and Fortune be my gods, my guide!	999
My will is back'd with resolution:	999
Thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried;	999
The blackest sin is clear'd with absolution;	999
Against love's fire fear's frost hath dissolution.	999
The eye of heaven is out, and misty night	999
Covers the shame that follows sweet delight.'	999
	999
This said, his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch,	999
And with his knee the door he opens wide.	999
The dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch:	999
Thus treason works ere traitors be espied.	999
Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside;	999
But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,	999
Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.	999
	999
Into the chamber wickedly he stalks,	999
And gazeth on her yet unstained bed.	999
The curtains being close, about he walks,	999
Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:	999
By their high treason is his heart misled;	999
Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon	999
To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon.	999
	999
Look, as the fair and fiery-pointed sun,	999
Rushing from forth a cloud, bereaves our sight;	999
Even so, the curtain drawn, his eyes begun	999
To wink, being blinded with a greater light:	999
Whether it is that she reflects so bright,	999
That dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed;	999
But blind they are, and keep themselves enclosed.	999
	999
O, had they in that darksome prison died!	999
Then had they seen the period of their ill;	999
Then Collatine again, by Lucrece' side,	999
In his clear bed might have reposed still:	999
But they must ope, this blessed league to kill;	999
And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight	999
Must sell her joy, her life, her world's delight.	999
	999
Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,	999
Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;	999
Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,	999
Swelling on either side to want his bliss;	999
Between whose hills her head entombed is:	999
Where, like a virtuous monument, she lies,	999
To be admired of lewd unhallow'd eyes.	999
	999
Without the bed her other fair hand was,	999
On the green coverlet; whose perfect white	999
Show'd like an April daisy on the grass,	999
With pearly sweat, resembling dew of night.	999
Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,	999
And canopied in darkness sweetly lay,	999
Till they might open to adorn the day.	999
	999
Her hair, like golden threads, play'd with her breath;	999
O modest wantons! wanton modesty!	999
Showing life's triumph in the map of death,	999
And death's dim look in life's mortality:	999
Each in her sleep themselves so beautify,	999
As if between them twain there were no strife,	999
But that life lived in death, and death in life.	999
	999
Her breasts, like ivory globes circled with blue,	999
A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,	999
Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,	999
And him by oath they truly honoured.	999
These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred;	999
Who, like a foul ursurper, went about	999
From this fair throne to heave the owner out.	999
	999
What could he see but mightily he noted?	999
What did he note but strongly he desired?	999
What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,	999
And in his will his wilful eye he tired.	999
With more than admiration he admired	999
Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,	999
Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.	999
	999
As the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey,	999
Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,	999
So o'er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,	999
His rage of lust by gazing qualified;	999
Slack'd, not suppress'd; for standing by her side,	999
His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,	999
Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:	999
	999
And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,	999
Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting,	999
In bloody death and ravishment delighting,	999
Nor children's tears nor mothers' groans respecting,	999
Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting:	999
Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,	999
Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.	999
	999
His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,	999
His eye commends the leading to his hand;	999
His hand, as proud of such a dignity,	999
Smoking with pride, march'd on to make his stand	999
On her bare breast, the heart of all her land;	999
Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,	999
Left there round turrets destitute and pale.	999
	999
They, mustering to the quiet cabinet	999
Where their dear governess and lady lies,	999
Do tell her she is dreadfully beset,	999
And fright her with confusion of their cries:	999
She, much amazed, breaks ope her lock'd-up eyes,	999
Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,	999
Are by his flaming torch dimm'd and controll'd.	999
	999
Imagine her as one in dead of night	999
From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,	999
That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,	999
Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking;	999
What terror or 'tis! but she, in worser taking,	999
From sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view	999
The sight which makes supposed terror true.	999
	999
Wrapp'd and confounded in a thousand fears,	999
Like to a new-kill'd bird she trembling lies;	999
She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears	999
Quick-shifting antics, ugly in her eyes:	999
Such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries;	999
Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,	999
In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.	999
	999
His hand, that yet remains upon her breast,--	999
Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!--	999
May feel her heart-poor citizen!--distress'd,	999
Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,	999
Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.	999
This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,	999
To make the breach and enter this sweet city.	999
	999
First, like a trumpet, doth his tongue begin	999
To sound a parley to his heartless foe;	999
Who o'er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,	999
The reason of this rash alarm to know,	999
Which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show;	999
But she with vehement prayers urgeth still	999
Under what colour he commits this ill.	999
	999
Thus he replies: 'The colour in thy face,	999
That even for anger makes the lily pale,	999
And the red rose blush at her own disgrace,	999
Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale:	999
Under that colour am I come to scale	999
Thy never-conquer'd fort: the fault is thine,	999
For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine.	999
	999
'Thus I forestall thee, if thou mean to chide:	999
Thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night,	999
Where thou with patience must my will abide;	999
My will that marks thee for my earth's delight,	999
Which I to conquer sought with all my might;	999
But as reproof and reason beat it dead,	999
By thy bright beauty was it newly bred.	999
	999
'I see what crosses my attempt will bring;	999
I know what thorns the growing rose defends;	999
I think the honey guarded with a sting;	999
All this beforehand counsel comprehends:	999
But will is deaf and hears no heedful friends;	999
Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty,	999
And dotes on what he looks, 'gainst law or duty.	999
	999
'I have debated, even in my soul,	999
What wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed;	999
But nothing can affection's course control,	999
Or stop the headlong fury of his speed.	999
I know repentant tears ensue the deed,	999
Reproach, disdain, and deadly enmity;	999
Yet strive I to embrace mine infamy.'	999
	999
This said, he shakes aloft his Roman blade,	999
Which, like a falcon towering in the skies,	999
Coucheth the fowl below with his wings' shade,	999
Whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies:	999
So under his insulting falchion lies	999
Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells	999
With trembling fear, as fowl hear falcon's bells.	999
	999
'Lucrece,' quoth he,'this night I must enjoy thee:	999
If thou deny, then force must work my way,	999
For in thy bed I purpose to destroy thee:	999
That done, some worthless slave of thine I'll slay,	999
To kill thine honour with thy life's decay;	999
And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him,	999
Swearing I slew him, seeing thee embrace him.	999
	999
'So thy surviving husband shall remain	999
The scornful mark of every open eye;	999
Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,	999
Thy issue blurr'd with nameless bastardy:	999
And thou, the author of their obloquy,	999
Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,	999
And sung by children in succeeding times.	999
	999
'But if thou yield, I rest thy secret friend:	999
The fault unknown is as a thought unacted;	999
A little harm done to a great good end	999
For lawful policy remains enacted.	999
The poisonous simple sometimes is compacted	999
In a pure compound; being so applied,	999
His venom in effect is purified.	999
	999
'Then, for thy husband and thy children's sake,	999
Tender my suit: bequeath not to their lot	999
The shame that from them no device can take,	999
The blemish that will never be forgot;	999
Worse than a slavish wipe or birth-hour's blot:	999
For marks descried in men's nativity	999
Are nature's faults, not their own infamy.'	999
	999
Here with a cockatrice' dead-killing eye	999
He rouseth up himself and makes a pause;	999
While she, the picture of pure piety,	999
Like a white hind under the gripe's sharp claws,	999
Pleads, in a wilderness where are no laws,	999
To the rough beast that knows no gentle right,	999
Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite.	999
	999
But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,	999
In his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding,	999
From earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get,	999
Which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding,	999
Hindering their present fall by this dividing;	999
So his unhallow'd haste her words delays,	999
And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays.	999
	999
Yet, foul night-waking cat, he doth but dally,	999
While in his hold-fast foot the weak mouse panteth:	999
Her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly,	999
A swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth:	999
His ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth	999
No penetrable entrance to her plaining:	999
Tears harden lust, though marble wear with raining.	999
	999
Her pity-pleading eyes are sadly fix'd	999
In the remorseless wrinkles of his face;	999
Her modest eloquence with sighs is mix'd,	999
Which to her oratory adds more grace.	999
She puts the period often from his place;	999
And midst the sentence so her accent breaks,	999
That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks.	999
	999
She conjures him by high almighty Jove,	999
By knighthood, gentry, and sweet friendship's oath,	999
By her untimely tears, her husband's love,	999
By holy human law, and common troth,	999
By heaven and earth, and all the power of both,	999
That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,	999
And stoop to honour, not to foul desire.	999
	999
Quoth she, 'Reward not hospitality	999
With such black payment as thou hast pretended;	999
Mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee;	999
Mar not the thing that cannot be amended;	999
End thy ill aim before thy shoot be ended;	999
He is no woodman that doth bend his bow	999
To strike a poor unseasonable doe.	999
	999
'My husband is thy friend; for his sake spare me:	999
Thyself art mighty; for thine own sake leave me:	999
Myself a weakling; do not then ensnare me:	999
Thou look'st not like deceit; do not deceive me.	999
My sighs, like whirlwinds, labour hence to heave thee:	999
If ever man were moved with woman moans,	999
Be moved with my tears, my sighs, my groans:	999
	999
'All which together, like a troubled ocean,	999
Beat at thy rocky and wreck-threatening heart,	999
To soften it with their continual motion;	999
For stones dissolved to water do convert.	999
O, if no harder than a stone thou art,	999
Melt at my tears, and be compassionate!	999
Soft pity enters at an iron gate.	999
	999
'In Tarquin's likeness I did entertain thee:	999
Hast thou put on his shape to do him shame?	999
To all the host of heaven I complain me,	999
Thou wrong'st his honour, wound'st his princely name.	999
Thou art not what thou seem'st; and if the same,	999
Thou seem'st not what thou art, a god, a king;	999
For kings like gods should govern everything.	999
	999
'How will thy shame be seeded in thine age,	999
When thus thy vices bud before thy spring!	999
If in thy hope thou darest do such outrage,	999
What darest thou not when once thou art a king?	999
O, be remember'd, no outrageous thing	999
From vassal actors can be wiped away;	999
Then kings' misdeeds cannot be hid in clay.	999
	999
'This deed will make thee only loved for fear;	999
But happy monarchs still are fear'd for love:	999
With foul offenders thou perforce must bear,	999
When they in thee the like offences prove:	999
If but for fear of this, thy will remove;	999
For princes are the glass, the school, the book,	999
Where subjects' eyes do learn, do read, do look.	999
	999
'And wilt thou be the school where Lust shall learn?	999
Must he in thee read lectures of such shame?	999
Wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern	999
Authority for sin, warrant for blame,	999
To privilege dishonour in thy name?	999
Thou black'st reproach against long-living laud,	999
And makest fair reputation but a bawd.	999
	999
'Hast thou command? by him that gave it thee,	999
From a pure heart command thy rebel will:	999
Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity,	999
For it was lent thee all that brood to kill.	999
Thy princely office how canst thou fulfil,	999
When, pattern'd by thy fault, foul sin may say,	999
He learn'd to sin, and thou didst teach the way?	999
	999
'Think but how vile a spectacle it were,	999
To view thy present trespass in another.	999
Men's faults do seldom to themselves appear;	999
Their own transgressions partially they smother:	999
This guilt would seem death-worthy in thy brother.	999
O, how are they wrapp'd in with infamies	999
That from their own misdeeds askance their eyes!	999
	999
'To thee, to thee, my heaved-up hands appeal,	999
Not to seducing lust, thy rash relier:	999
I sue for exiled majesty's repeal;	999
Let him return, and flattering thoughts retire:	999
His true respect will prison false desire,	999
And wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne,	999
That thou shalt see thy state and pity mine.'	999
	999
'Have done,' quoth he: 'my uncontrolled tide	999
Turns not, but swells the higher by this let.	999
Small lights are soon blown out, huge fires abide,	999
And with the wind in greater fury fret:	999
The petty streams that pay a daily debt	999
To their salt sovereign, with their fresh falls' haste	999
Add to his flow, but alter not his taste.'	999
	999
'Thou art,' quoth she, 'a sea, a sovereign king;	999
And, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood	999
Black lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning,	999
Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood.	999
If all these pretty ills shall change thy good,	999
Thy sea within a puddle's womb is hearsed,	999
And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed.	999
	999
'So shall these slaves be king, and thou their slave;	999
Thou nobly base, they basely dignified;	999
Thou their fair life, and they thy fouler grave:	999
Thou loathed in their shame, they in thy pride:	999
The lesser thing should not the greater hide;	999
The cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot,	999
But low shrubs wither at the cedar's root.	999
	999
'So let thy thoughts, low vassals to thy state'--	999
No more,' quoth he; 'by heaven, I will not hear thee:	999
Yield to my love; if not, enforced hate,	999
Instead of love's coy touch, shall rudely tear thee;	999
That done, despitefully I mean to bear thee	999
Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,	999
To be thy partner in this shameful doom.'	999
	999
This said, he sets his foot upon the light,	999
For light and lust are deadly enemies:	999
Shame folded up in blind concealing night,	999
When most unseen, then most doth tyrannize.	999
The wolf hath seized his prey, the poor lamb cries;	999
Till with her own white fleece her voice controll'd	999
Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:	999
	999
For with the nightly linen that she wears	999
He pens her piteous clamours in her head;	999
Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears	999
That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed.	999
O, that prone lust should stain so pure a bed!	999
The spots whereof could weeping purify,	999
Her tears should drop on them perpetually.	999
	999
But she hath lost a dearer thing than life,	999
And he hath won what he would lose again:	999
This forced league doth force a further strife;	999
This momentary joy breeds months of pain;	999
This hot desire converts to cold disdain:	999
Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,	999
And Lust, the thief, far poorer than before.	999
	999
Look, as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk,	999
Unapt for tender smell or speedy flight,	999
Make slow pursuit, or altogether balk	999
The prey wherein by nature they delight;	999
So surfeit-taking Tarquin fares this night:	999
His taste delicious, in digestion souring,	999
Devours his will, that lived by foul devouring.	999
	999
O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit	999
Can comprehend in still imagination!	999
Drunken Desire must vomit his receipt,	999
Ere he can see his own abomination.	999
While Lust is in his pride, no exclamation	999
Can curb his heat or rein his rash desire,	999
Till like a jade Self-will himself doth tire.	999
	999
And then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek,	999
With heavy eye, knit brow, and strengthless pace,	999
Feeble Desire, all recreant, poor, and meek,	999
Like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case:	999
The flesh being proud, Desire doth fight with Grace,	999
For there it revels; and when that decays,	999
The guilty rebel for remission prays.	999
	999
So fares it with this faultful lord of Rome,	999
Who this accomplishment so hotly chased;	999
For now against himself he sounds this doom,	999
That through the length of times he stands disgraced:	999
Besides, his soul's fair temple is defaced;	999
To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares,	999
To ask the spotted princess how she fares.	999
	999
She says, her subjects with foul insurrection	999
Have batter'd down her consecrated wall,	999
And by their mortal fault brought in subjection	999
Her immortality, and made her thrall	999
To living death and pain perpetual:	999
Which in her prescience she controlled still,	999
But her foresight could not forestall their will.	999
	999
Even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth,	999
A captive victor that hath lost in gain;	999
Bearing away the wound that nothing healeth,	999
The scar that will, despite of cure, remain;	999
Leaving his spoil perplex'd in greater pain.	999
She bears the load of lust he left behind,	999
And he the burden of a guilty mind.	999
	999
He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;	999
She like a wearied lamb lies panting there;	999
He scowls and hates himself for his offence;	999
She, desperate, with her nails her flesh doth tear;	999
He faintly flies, sneaking with guilty fear;	999
She stays, exclaiming on the direful night;	999
He runs, and chides his vanish'd, loathed delight.	999
	999
He thence departs a heavy convertite;	999
She there remains a hopeless castaway;	999
He in his speed looks for the morning light;	999
She prays she never may behold the day,	999
'For day,' quoth she, 'nights scapes doth open lay,	999
And my true eyes have never practised how	999
To cloak offences with a cunning brow.	999
	999
'They think not but that every eye can see	999
The same disgrace which they themselves behold;	999
And therefore would they still in darkness be,	999
To have their unseen sin remain untold;	999
For they their guilt with weeping will unfold,	999
And grave, like water that doth eat in steel,	999
Upon my cheeks what helpless shame I feel.'	999
	999
Here she exclaims against repose and rest,	999
And bids her eyes hereafter still be blind.	999
She wakes her heart by beating on her breast,	999
And bids it leap from thence, where it may find	999
Some purer chest to close so pure a mind.	999
Frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite	999
Against the unseen secrecy of night:	999
	999
'O comfort-killing Night, image of hell!	999
Dim register and notary of shame!	999
Black stage for tragedies and murders fell!	999
Vast sin-concealing chaos! nurse of blame!	999
Blind muffled bawd! dark harbour for defame!	999
Grim cave of death! whispering conspirator	999
With close-tongued treason and the ravisher!	999
	999
'O hateful, vaporous, and foggy Night!	999
Since thou art guilty of my cureless crime,	999
Muster thy mists to meet the eastern light,	999
Make war against proportion'd course of time;	999
Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb	999
His wonted height, yet ere he go to bed,	999
Knit poisonous clouds about his golden head.	999
	999
'With rotten damps ravish the morning air;	999
Let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick	999
The life of purity, the supreme fair,	999
Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;	999
And let thy misty vapours march so thick,	999
That in their smoky ranks his smother'd light	999
May set at noon and make perpetual night.	999
	999
'Were Tarquin Night, as he is but Night's child,	999
The silver-shining queen he would distain;	999
Her twinkling handmaids too, by him defiled,	999
Through Night's black bosom should not peep again:	999
So should I have co-partners in my pain;	999
And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage,	999
As palmers' chat makes short their pilgrimage.	999
	999
'Where now I have no one to blush with me,	999
To cross their arms and hang their heads with mine,	999
To mask their brows and hide their infamy;	999
But I alone alone must sit and pine,	999
Seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine,	999
Mingling my talk with tears, my grief with groans,	999
Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans.	999
	999
'O Night, thou furnace of foul-reeking smoke,	999
Let not the jealous Day behold that face	999
Which underneath thy black all-hiding cloak	999
Immodestly lies martyr'd with disgrace!	999
Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,	999
That all the faults which in thy reign are made	999
May likewise be sepulchred in thy shade!	999
	999
'Make me not object to the tell-tale Day!	999
The light will show, character'd in my brow,	999
The story of sweet chastity's decay,	999
The impious breach of holy wedlock vow:	999
Yea the illiterate, that know not how	999
To cipher what is writ in learned books,	999
Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks.	999
	999
'The nurse, to still her child, will tell my story,	999
And fright her crying babe with Tarquin's name;	999
The orator, to deck his oratory,	999
Will couple my reproach to Tarquin's shame;	999
Feast-finding minstrels, tuning my defame,	999
Will tie the hearers to attend each line,	999
How Tarquin wronged me, I Collatine.	999
	999
'Let my good name, that senseless reputation,	999
For Collatine's dear love be kept unspotted:	999
If that be made a theme for disputation,	999
The branches of another root are rotted,	999
And undeserved reproach to him allotted	999
That is as clear from this attaint of mine	999
As I, ere this, was pure to Collatine.	999
	999
'O unseen shame! invisible disgrace!	999
O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!	999
Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,	999
And Tarquin's eye may read the mot afar,	999
How he in peace is wounded, not in war.	999
Alas, how many bear such shameful blows,	999
Which not themselves, but he that gives them knows!	999
	999
'If, Collatine, thine honour lay in me,	999
From me by strong assault it is bereft.	999
My honour lost, and I, a drone-like bee,	999
Have no perfection of my summer left,	999
But robb'd and ransack'd by injurious theft:	999
In thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept,	999
And suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept.	999
	999
'Yet am I guilty of thy honour's wrack;	999
Yet for thy honour did I entertain him;	999
Coming from thee, I could not put him back,	999
For it had been dishonour to disdain him:	999
Besides, of weariness he did complain him,	999
And talk'd of virtue: O unlook'd-for evil,	999
When virtue is profaned in such a devil!	999
	999
'Why should the worm intrude the maiden bud?	999
Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows' nests?	999
Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?	999
Or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts?	999
Or kings be breakers of their own behests?	999
But no perfection is so absolute,	999
That some impurity doth not pollute.	999
	999
'The aged man that coffers-up his gold	999
Is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits;	999
And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,	999
But like still-pining Tantalus he sits,	999
And useless barns the harvest of his wits;	999
Having no other pleasure of his gain	999
But torment that it cannot cure his pain.	999
	999
'So then he hath it when he cannot use it,	999
And leaves it to be master'd by his young;	999
Who in their pride do presently abuse it:	999
Their father was too weak, and they too strong,	999
To hold their cursed-blessed fortune long.	999
The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours	999
Even in the moment that we call them ours.	999
	999
'Unruly blasts wait on the tender spring;	999
Unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers;	999
The adder hisses where the sweet birds sing;	999
What virtue breeds iniquity devours:	999
We have no good that we can say is ours,	999
But ill-annexed Opportunity	999
Or kills his life or else his quality.	999
	999
'O Opportunity, thy guilt is great!	999
'Tis thou that executest the traitor's treason:	999
Thou set'st the wolf where he the lamb may get;	999
Whoever plots the sin, thou 'point'st the season;	999
'Tis thou that spurn'st at right, at law, at reason;	999
And in thy shady cell, where none may spy him,	999
Sits Sin, to seize the souls that wander by him.	999
	999
'Thou makest the vestal violate her oath;	999
Thou blow'st the fire when temperance is thaw'd;	999
Thou smother'st honesty, thou murder'st troth;	999
Thou foul abettor! thou notorious bawd!	999
Thou plantest scandal and displacest laud:	999
Thou ravisher, thou traitor, thou false thief,	999
Thy honey turns to gall, thy joy to grief!	999
	999
'Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame,	999
Thy private feasting to a public fast,	999
Thy smoothing titles to a ragged name,	999
Thy sugar'd tongue to bitter wormwood taste:	999
Thy violent vanities can never last.	999
How comes it then, vile Opportunity,	999
Being so bad, such numbers seek for thee?	999
	999
'When wilt thou be the humble suppliant's friend,	999
And bring him where his suit may be obtain'd?	999
When wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end?	999
Or free that soul which wretchedness hath chain'd?	999
Give physic to the sick, ease to the pain'd?	999
The poor, lame, blind, halt, creep, cry out for thee;	999
But they ne'er meet with Opportunity.	999
	999
'The patient dies while the physician sleeps;	999
The orphan pines while the oppressor feeds;	999
Justice is feasting while the widow weeps;	999
Advice is sporting while infection breeds:	999
Thou grant'st no time for charitable deeds:	999
Wrath, envy, treason, rape, and murder's rages,	999
Thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages.	999
	999
'When Truth and Virtue have to do with thee,	999
A thousand crosses keep them from thy aid:	999
They buy thy help; but Sin ne'er gives a fee,	999
He gratis comes; and thou art well appaid	999
As well to hear as grant what he hath said.	999
My Collatine would else have come to me	999
When Tarquin did, but he was stay'd by thee.	999
	999
Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,	999
Guilty of perjury and subornation,	999
Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,	999
Guilty of incest, that abomination;	999
An accessary by thine inclination	999
To all sins past, and all that are to come,	999
From the creation to the general doom.	999
	999
'Mis-shapen Time, copesmate of ugly Night,	999
Swift subtle post, carrier of grisly care,	999
Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,	999
Base watch of woes, sin's pack-horse, virtue's snare;	999
Thou nursest all and murder'st all that are:	999
O, hear me then, injurious, shifting Time!	999
Be guilty of my death, since of my crime.	999
	999
'Why hath thy servant, Opportunity,	999
Betray'd the hours thou gavest me to repose,	999
Cancell'd my fortunes, and enchained me	999
To endless date of never-ending woes?	999
Time's office is to fine the hate of foes;	999
To eat up errors by opinion bred,	999
Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.	999
	999
'Time's glory is to calm contending kings,	999
To unmask falsehood and bring truth to light,	999
To stamp the seal of time in aged things,	999
To wake the morn and sentinel the night,	999
To wrong the wronger till he render right,	999
To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours,	999
And smear with dust their glittering golden towers;	999
	999
'To fill with worm-holes stately monuments,	999
To feed oblivion with decay of things,	999
To blot old books and alter their contents,	999
To pluck the quills from ancient ravens' wings,	999
To dry the old oak's sap and cherish springs,	999
To spoil antiquities of hammer'd steel,	999
And turn the giddy round of Fortune's wheel;	999
	999
'To show the beldam daughters of her daughter,	999
To make the child a man, the man a child,	999
To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter,	999
To tame the unicorn and lion wild,	999
To mock the subtle in themselves beguiled,	999
To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops,	999
And waste huge stones with little water drops.	999
	999
'Why work'st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage,	999
Unless thou couldst return to make amends?	999
One poor retiring minute in an age	999
Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends,	999
Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends:	999
O, this dread night, wouldst thou one hour come back,	999
I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack!	999
	999
'Thou ceaseless lackey to eternity,	999
With some mischance cross Tarquin in his flight:	999
Devise extremes beyond extremity,	999
To make him curse this cursed crimeful night:	999
Let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright;	999
And the dire thought of his committed evil	999
Shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil.	999
	999
'Disturb his hours of rest with restless trances,	999
Afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans;	999
Let there bechance him pitiful mischances,	999
To make him moan; but pity not his moans:	999
Stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones;	999
And let mild women to him lose their mildness,	999
Wilder to him than tigers in their wildness.	999
	999
'Let him have time to tear his curled hair,	999
Let him have time against himself to rave,	999
Let him have time of Time's help to despair,	999
Let him have time to live a loathed slave,	999
Let him have time a beggar's orts to crave,	999
And time to see one that by alms doth live	999
Disdain to him disdained scraps to give.	999
	999
'Let him have time to see his friends his foes,	999
And merry fools to mock at him resort;	999
Let him have time to mark how slow time goes	999
In time of sorrow, and how swift and short	999
His time of folly and his time of sport;	999
And ever let his unrecalling crime	999
Have time to wail th' abusing of his time.	999
	999
'O Time, thou tutor both to good and bad,	999
Teach me to curse him that thou taught'st this ill!	999
At his own shadow let the thief run mad,	999
Himself himself seek every hour to kill!	999
Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill;	999
For who so base would such an office have	999
As slanderous death's-man to so base a slave?	999
	999
'The baser is he, coming from a king,	999
To shame his hope with deeds degenerate:	999
The mightier man, the mightier is the thing	999
That makes him honour'd, or begets him hate;	999
For greatest scandal waits on greatest state.	999
The moon being clouded presently is miss'd,	999
But little stars may hide them when they list.	999
	999
'The crow may bathe his coal-black wings in mire,	999
And unperceived fly with the filth away;	999
But if the like the snow-white swan desire,	999
The stain upon his silver down will stay.	999
Poor grooms are sightless night, kings glorious day:	999
Gnats are unnoted wheresoe'er they fly,	999
But eagles gazed upon with every eye.	999
	999
'Out, idle words, servants to shallow fools!	999
Unprofitable sounds, weak arbitrators!	999
Busy yourselves in skill-contending schools;	999
Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters;	999
To trembling clients be you mediators:	999
For me, I force not argument a straw,	999
Since that my case is past the help of law.	999
	999
'In vain I rail at Opportunity,	999
At Time, at Tarquin, and uncheerful Night;	999
In vain I cavil with mine infamy,	999
In vain I spurn at my confirm'd despite:	999
This helpless smoke of words doth me no right.	999
The remedy indeed to do me good	999
Is to let forth my foul-defiled blood.	999
	999
'Poor hand, why quiver'st thou at this decree?	999
Honour thyself to rid me of this shame:	999
For if I die, my honour lives in thee;	999
But if I live, thou livest in my defame:	999
Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame,	999
And wast afeard to scratch her wicked foe,	999
Kill both thyself and her for yielding so.'	999
	999
This said, from her be-tumbled couch she starteth,	999
To find some desperate instrument of death:	999
But this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth	999
To make more vent for passage of her breath;	999
Which, thronging through her lips, so vanisheth	999
As smoke from AEtna, that in air consumes,	999
Or that which from discharged cannon fumes.	999
	999
'In vain,' quoth she, 'I live, and seek in vain	999
Some happy mean to end a hapless life.	999
I fear'd by Tarquin's falchion to be slain,	999
Yet for the self-same purpose seek a knife:	999
But when I fear'd I was a loyal wife:	999
So am I now: O no, that cannot be;	999
Of that true type hath Tarquin rifled me.	999
	999
'O, that is gone for which I sought to live,	999
And therefore now I need not fear to die.	999
To clear this spot by death, at least I give	999
A badge of fame to slander's livery;	999
A dying life to living infamy:	999
Poor helpless help, the treasure stol'n away,	999
To burn the guiltless casket where it lay!	999
	999
'Well, well, dear Collatine, thou shalt not know	999
The stained taste of violated troth;	999
I will not wrong thy true affection so,	999
To flatter thee with an infringed oath;	999
This bastard graff shall never come to growth:	999
He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute	999
That thou art doting father of his fruit.	999
	999
'Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought,	999
Nor laugh with his companions at thy state:	999
But thou shalt know thy interest was not bought	999
Basely with gold, but stol'n from forth thy gate.	999
For me, I am the mistress of my fate,	999
And with my trespass never will dispense,	999
Till life to death acquit my forced offence.	999
	999
'I will not poison thee with my attaint,	999
Nor fold my fault in cleanly-coin'd excuses;	999
My sable ground of sin I will not paint,	999
To hide the truth of this false night's abuses:	999
My tongue shall utter all; mine eyes, like sluices,	999
As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale,	999
Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale.'	999
	999
By this, lamenting Philomel had ended	999
The well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow,	999
And solemn night with slow sad gait descended	999
To ugly hell; when, lo, the blushing morrow	999
Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow:	999
But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see,	999
And therefore still in night would cloister'd be.	999
	999
Revealing day through every cranny spies,	999
And seems to point her out where she sits weeping;	999
To whom she sobbing speaks: 'O eye of eyes,	999
Why pry'st thou through my window? leave thy peeping:	999
Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping:	999
Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light,	999
For day hath nought to do what's done by night.'	999
	999
Thus cavils she with every thing she sees:	999
True grief is fond and testy as a child,	999
Who wayward once, his mood with nought agrees:	999
Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;	999
Continuance tames the one; the other wild,	999
Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still,	999
With too much labour drowns for want of skill.	999
	999
So she, deep-drenched in a sea of care,	999
Holds disputation with each thing she views,	999
And to herself all sorrow doth compare;	999
No object but her passion's strength renews;	999
And as one shifts, another straight ensues:	999
Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;	999
Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.	999
	999
The little birds that tune their morning's joy	999
Make her moans mad with their sweet melody:	999
For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy;	999
Sad souls are slain in merry company;	999
Grief best is pleased with grief's society:	999
True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed	999
When with like semblance it is sympathized.	999
	999
'Tis double death to drown in ken of shore;	999
He ten times pines that pines beholding food;	999
To see the salve doth make the wound ache more;	999
Great grief grieves most at that would do it good;	999
Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,	999
Who being stopp'd, the bounding banks o'erflows;	999
Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows.	999
	999
'You mocking-birds,' quoth she, 'your tunes entomb	999
Within your hollow-swelling feather'd breasts,	999
And in my hearing be you mute and dumb:	999
My restless discord loves no stops nor rests;	999
A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests:	999
Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;	999
Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.	999
	999
'Come, Philomel, that sing'st of ravishment,	999
Make thy sad grove in my dishevell'd hair:	999
As the dank earth weeps at thy languishment,	999
So I at each sad strain will strain a tear,	999
And with deep groans the diapason bear;	999
For burden-wise I'll hum on Tarquin still,	999
While thou on Tereus descant'st better skill.	999
	999
'And whiles against a thorn thou bear'st thy part,	999
To keep thy sharp woes waking, wretched I,	999
To imitate thee well, against my heart	999
Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye;	999
Who, if it wink, shall thereon fall and die.	999
These means, as frets upon an instrument,	999
Shall tune our heart-strings to true languishment.	999
	999
'And for, poor bird, thou sing'st not in the day,	999
As shaming any eye should thee behold,	999
Some dark deep desert, seated from the way,	999
That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold,	999
Will we find out; and there we will unfold	999
To creatures stern sad tunes, to change their kinds:	999
Since men prove beasts, let beasts bear gentle minds.'	999
	999
As the poor frighted deer, that stands at gaze,	999
Wildly determining which way to fly,	999
Or one encompass'd with a winding maze,	999
That cannot tread the way out readily;	999
So with herself is she in mutiny,	999
To live or die which of the twain were better,	999
When life is shamed, and death reproach's debtor.	999
	999
'To kill myself,' quoth she, 'alack, what were it,	999
But with my body my poor soul's pollution?	999
They that lose half with greater patience bear it	999
Than they whose whole is swallow'd in confusion.	999
That mother tries a merciless conclusion	999
Who, having two sweet babes, when death takes one,	999
Will slay the other and be nurse to none.	999
	999
'My body or my soul, which was the dearer,	999
When the one pure, the other made divine?	999
Whose love of either to myself was nearer,	999
When both were kept for heaven and Collatine?	999
Ay me! the bark peel'd from the lofty pine,	999
His leaves will wither and his sap decay;	999
So must my soul, her bark being peel'd away.	999
	999
'Her house is sack'd, her quiet interrupted,	999
Her mansion batter'd by the enemy;	999
Her sacred temple spotted, spoil'd, corrupted,	999
Grossly engirt with daring infamy:	999
Then let it not be call'd impiety,	999
If in this blemish'd fort I make some hole	999
Through which I may convey this troubled soul.	999
	999
'Yet die I will not till my Collatine	999
Have heard the cause of my untimely death;	999
That he may vow, in that sad hour of mine,	999
Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.	999
My stained blood to Tarquin I'll bequeath,	999
Which by him tainted shall for him be spent,	999
And as his due writ in my testament.	999
	999
'My honour I'll bequeath unto the knife	999
That wounds my body so dishonoured.	999
'Tis honour to deprive dishonour'd life;	999
The one will live, the other being dead:	999
So of shame's ashes shall my fame be bred;	999
For in my death I murder shameful scorn:	999
My shame so dead, mine honour is new-born.	999
	999
'Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost,	999
What legacy shall I bequeath to thee?	999
My resolution, love, shall be thy boast,	999
By whose example thou revenged mayest be.	999
How Tarquin must be used, read it in me:	999
Myself, thy friend, will kill myself, thy foe,	999
And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so.	999
	999
'This brief abridgement of my will I make:	999
My soul and body to the skies and ground;	999
My resolution, husband, do thou take;	999
Mine honour be the knife's that makes my wound;	999
My shame be his that did my fame confound;	999
And all my fame that lives disbursed be	999
To those that live, and think no shame of me.	999
	999
'Thou, Collatine, shalt oversee this will;	999
How was I overseen that thou shalt see it!	999
My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill;	999
My life's foul deed, my life's fair end shall free it.	999
Faint not, faint heart, but stoutly say 'So be it:'	999
Yield to my hand; my hand shall conquer thee:	999
Thou dead, both die, and both shall victors be.'	999
	999
This Plot of death when sadly she had laid,	999
And wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes,	999
With untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid,	999
Whose swift obedience to her mistress hies;	999
For fleet-wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies.	999
Poor Lucrece' cheeks unto her maid seem so	999
As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow.	999
	999
Her mistress she doth give demure good-morrow,	999
With soft-slow tongue, true mark of modesty,	999
And sorts a sad look to her lady's sorrow,	999
For why her face wore sorrow's livery;	999
But durst not ask of her audaciously	999
Why her two suns were cloud-eclipsed so,	999
Nor why her fair cheeks over-wash'd with woe.	999
	999
But as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,	999
Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;	999
Even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet	999
Her circled eyne, enforced by sympathy	999
Of those fair suns set in her mistress' sky,	999
Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light,	999
Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night.	999
	999
A pretty while these pretty creatures stand,	999
Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling:	999
One justly weeps; the other takes in hand	999
No cause, but company, of her drops spilling:	999
Their gentle sex to weep are often willing;	999
Grieving themselves to guess at others' smarts,	999
And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts.	999
	999
For men have marble, women waxen, minds,	999
And therefore are they form'd as marble will;	999
The weak oppress'd, the impression of strange kinds	999
Is form'd in them by force, by fraud, or skill:	999
Then call them not the authors of their ill,	999
No more than wax shall be accounted evil	999
Wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil.	999
	999
Their smoothness, like a goodly champaign plain,	999
Lays open all the little worms that creep;	999
In men, as in a rough-grown grove, remain	999
Cave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep:	999
Through crystal walls each little mote will peep:	999
Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,	999
Poor women's faces are their own fault's books.	999
	999
No man inveigh against the wither'd flower,	999
But chide rough winter that the flower hath kill'd:	999
Not that devour'd, but that which doth devour,	999
Is worthy blame. O, let it not be hild	999
Poor women's faults, that they are so fulfill'd	999
With men's abuses: those proud lords, to blame,	999
Make weak-made women tenants to their shame.	999
	999
The precedent whereof in Lucrece view,	999
Assail'd by night with circumstances strong	999
Of present death, and shame that might ensue	999
By that her death, to do her husband wrong:	999
Such danger to resistance did belong,	999
That dying fear through all her body spread;	999
And who cannot abuse a body dead?	999
	999
By this, mild patience bid fair Lucrece speak	999
To the poor counterfeit of her complaining:	999
'My girl,' quoth she, 'on what occasion break	999
Those tears from thee, that down thy cheeks are	999
raining?	999
If thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining,	999
Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood:	999
If tears could help, mine own would do me good.	999
	999
'But tell me, girl, when went'--and there she stay'd	999
Till after a deep groan--'Tarquin from hence?'	999
'Madam, ere I was up,' replied the maid,	999
'The more to blame my sluggard negligence:	999
Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense;	999
Myself was stirring ere the break of day,	999
And, ere I rose, was Tarquin gone away.	999
	999
'But, lady, if your maid may be so bold,	999
She would request to know your heaviness.'	999
'O, peace!' quoth Lucrece: 'if it should be told,	999
The repetition cannot make it less;	999
For more it is than I can well express:	999
And that deep torture may be call'd a hell	999
When more is felt than one hath power to tell.	999
	999
'Go, get me hither paper, ink, and pen:	999
Yet save that labour, for I have them here.	999
What should I say? One of my husband's men	999
Bid thou be ready, by and by, to bear	999
A letter to my lord, my love, my dear;	999
Bid him with speed prepare to carry it;	999
The cause craves haste, and it will soon be writ.'	999
	999
Her maid is gone, and she prepares to write,	999
First hovering o'er the paper with her quill:	999
Conceit and grief an eager combat fight;	999
What wit sets down is blotted straight with will;	999
This is too curious-good, this blunt and ill:	999
Much like a press of people at a door,	999
Throng her inventions, which shall go before.	999
	999
At last she thus begins: 'Thou worthy lord	999
Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee,	999
Health to thy person! next vouchsafe t' afford--	999
If ever, love, thy Lucrece thou wilt see--	999
Some present speed to come and visit me.	999
So, I commend me from our house in grief:	999
My woes are tedious, though my words are brief.'	999
	999
Here folds she up the tenor of her woe,	999
Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly.	999
By this short schedule Collatine may know	999
Her grief, but not her grief's true quality:	999
She dares not thereof make discovery,	999
Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,	999
Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.	999
	999
Besides, the life and feeling of her passion	999
She hoards, to spend when he is by to hear her:	999
When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion	999
Of her disgrace, the better so to clear her	999
From that suspicion which the world might bear her.	999
To shun this blot, she would not blot the letter	999
With words, till action might become them better.	999
	999
To see sad sights moves more than hear them told;	999
For then eye interprets to the ear	999
The heavy motion that it doth behold,	999
When every part a part of woe doth bear.	999
'Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear:	999
Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords,	999
And sorrow ebbs, being blown with wind of words.	999
	999
Her letter now is seal'd, and on it writ	999
'At Ardea to my lord with more than haste.'	999
The post attends, and she delivers it,	999
Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast	999
As lagging fowls before the northern blast:	999
Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems:	999
Extremity still urgeth such extremes.	999
	999
The homely villain court'sies to her low;	999
And, blushing on her, with a steadfast eye	999
Receives the scroll without or yea or no,	999
And forth with bashful innocence doth hie.	999
But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie	999
Imagine every eye beholds their blame;	999
For Lucrece thought he blush'd to her see shame:	999
	999
When, silly groom! God wot, it was defect	999
Of spirit, Life, and bold audacity.	999
Such harmless creatures have a true respect	999
To talk in deeds, while others saucily	999
Promise more speed, but do it leisurely:	999
Even so this pattern of the worn-out age	999
Pawn'd honest looks, but laid no words to gage.	999
	999
His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,	999
That two red fires in both their faces blazed;	999
She thought he blush'd, as knowing Tarquin's lust,	999
And, blushing with him, wistly on him gazed;	999
Her earnest eye did make him more amazed:	999
The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish,	999
The more she thought he spied in her some blemish.	999
	999
But long she thinks till he return again,	999
And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone.	999
The weary time she cannot entertain,	999
For now 'tis stale to sigh, to weep, and groan:	999
So woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan,	999
That she her plaints a little while doth stay,	999
Pausing for means to mourn some newer way.	999
	999
At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece	999
Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:	999
Before the which is drawn the power of Greece.	999
For Helen's rape the city to destroy,	999
Threatening cloud-kissing Ilion with annoy;	999
Which the conceited painter drew so proud,	999
As heaven, it seem'd, to kiss the turrets bow'd.	999
	999
A thousand lamentable objects there,	999
In scorn of nature, art gave lifeless life:	999
Many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear,	999
Shed for the slaughter'd husband by the wife:	999
The red blood reek'd, to show the painter's strife;	999
And dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights,	999
Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights.	999
	999
There might you see the labouring pioner	999
Begrimed with sweat, and smeared all with dust;	999
And from the towers of Troy there would appear	999
The very eyes of men through loop-holes thrust,	999
Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust:	999
Such sweet observance in this work was had,	999
That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.	999
	999
In great commanders grace and majesty	999
You might behold, triumphing in their faces;	999
In youth, quick bearing and dexterity;	999
Pale cowards, marching on with trembling paces;	999
Which heartless peasants did so well resemble,	999
That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble.	999
	999
In Ajax and Ulysses, O, what art	999
Of physiognomy might one behold!	999
The face of either cipher'd either's heart;	999
Their face their manners most expressly told:	999
In Ajax' eyes blunt rage and rigor roll'd;	999
But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent	999
Show'd deep regard and smiling government.	999
	999
There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand,	999
As 'twere encouraging the Greeks to fight;	999
Making such sober action with his hand,	999
That it beguiled attention, charm'd the sight:	999
In speech, it seem'd, his beard, all silver white,	999
Wagg'd up and down, and from his lips did fly	999
Thin winding breath, which purl'd up to the sky.	999
	999
About him were a press of gaping faces,	999
Which seem'd to swallow up his sound advice;	999
All jointly listening, but with several graces,	999
As if some mermaid did their ears entice,	999
Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;	999
The scalps of many, almost hid behind,	999
To jump up higher seem'd, to mock the mind.	999
	999
Here one man's hand lean'd on another's head,	999
His nose being shadow'd by his neighbour's ear;	999
Here one being throng'd bears back, all boll'n and	999
red;	999
Another smother'd seems to pelt and swear;	999
And in their rage such signs of rage they bear,	999
As, but for loss of Nestor's golden words,	999
It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.	999
	999
For much imaginary work was there;	999
Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,	999
That for Achilles' image stood his spear,	999
Griped in an armed hand; himself, behind,	999
Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind:	999
A hand, a foot, a face, a leg, a head,	999
Stood for the whole to be imagined.	999
	999
And from the walls of strong-besieged Troy	999
When their brave hope, bold Hector, march'd to	999
field,	999
Stood many Trojan mothers, sharing joy	999
To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield;	999
And to their hope they such odd action yield,	999
That through their light joy seemed to appear,	999
Like bright things stain'd, a kind of heavy fear.	999
	999
And from the strand of Dardan, where they fought,	999
To Simois' reedy banks the red blood ran,	999
Whose waves to imitate the battle sought	999
With swelling ridges; and their ranks began	999
To break upon the galled shore, and than	999
Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,	999
They join and shoot their foam at Simois' banks.	999
	999
To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,	999
To find a face where all distress is stell'd.	999
Many she sees where cares have carved some,	999
But none where all distress and dolour dwell'd,	999
Till she despairing Hecuba beheld,	999
Staring on Priam's wounds with her old eyes,	999
Which bleeding under Pyrrhus' proud foot lies.	999
	999
In her the painter had anatomized	999
Time's ruin, beauty's wreck, and grim care's reign:	999
Her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised;	999
Of what she was no semblance did remain:	999
Her blue blood changed to black in every vein,	999
Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed,	999
Show'd life imprison'd in a body dead.	999
	999
On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,	999
And shapes her sorrow to the beldam's woes,	999
Who nothing wants to answer her but cries,	999
And bitter words to ban her cruel foes:	999
The painter was no god to lend her those;	999
And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong,	999
To give her so much grief and not a tongue.	999
	999
'Poor instrument,' quoth she,'without a sound,	999
I'll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue;	999
And drop sweet balm in Priam's painted wound,	999
And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong;	999
And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long;	999
And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes	999
Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies.	999
	999
'Show me the strumpet that began this stir,	999
That with my nails her beauty I may tear.	999
Thy heat of lust, fond Paris, did incur	999
This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear:	999
Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here;	999
And here in Troy, for trespass of thine eye,	999
The sire, the son, the dame, and daughter die.	999
	999
'Why should the private pleasure of some one	999
Become the public plague of many moe?	999
Let sin, alone committed, light alone	999
Upon his head that hath transgressed so;	999
Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe:	999
For one's offence why should so many fall,	999
To plague a private sin in general?	999
	999
'Lo, here weeps Hecuba, here Priam dies,	999
Here manly Hector faints, here Troilus swounds,	999
Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies,	999
And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds,	999
And one man's lust these many lives confounds:	999
Had doting Priam cheque'd his son's desire,	999
Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire.'	999
	999
Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted woes:	999
For sorrow, like a heavy-hanging bell,	999
Once set on ringing, with his own weight goes;	999
Then little strength rings out the doleful knell:	999
So Lucrece, set a-work, sad tales doth tell	999
To pencill'd pensiveness and colour'd sorrow;	999
She lends them words, and she their looks doth borrow.	999
	999
She throws her eyes about the painting round,	999
And whom she finds forlorn she doth lament.	999
At last she sees a wretched image bound,	999
That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent:	999
His face, though full of cares, yet show'd content;	999
Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,	999
So mild, that Patience seem'd to scorn his woes.	999
	999
In him the painter labour'd with his skill	999
To hide deceit, and give the harmless show	999
An humble gait, calm looks, eyes wailing still,	999
A brow unbent, that seem'd to welcome woe;	999
Cheeks neither red nor pale, but mingled so	999
That blushing red no guilty instance gave,	999
Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have.	999
	999
But, like a constant and confirmed devil,	999
He entertain'd a show so seeming just,	999
And therein so ensconced his secret evil,	999
That jealousy itself could not mistrust	999
False-creeping craft and perjury should thrust	999
Into so bright a day such black-faced storms,	999
Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.	999
	999
The well-skill'd workman this mild image drew	999
For perjured Sinon, whose enchanting story	999
The credulous old Priam after slew;	999
Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory	999
Of rich-built Ilion, that the skies were sorry,	999
And little stars shot from their fixed places,	999
When their glass fell wherein they view'd their faces.	999
	999
This picture she advisedly perused,	999
And chid the painter for his wondrous skill,	999
Saying, some shape in Sinon's was abused;	999
So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill:	999
And still on him she gazed; and gazing still,	999
Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied,	999
That she concludes the picture was belied.	999
	999
'It cannot be,' quoth she,'that so much guile'--	999
She would have said 'can lurk in such a look;'	999
But Tarquin's shape came in her mind the while,	999
And from her tongue 'can lurk' from 'cannot' took:	999
'It cannot be' she in that sense forsook,	999
And turn'd it thus,' It cannot be, I find,	999
But such a face should bear a wicked mind.	999
	999
'For even as subtle Sinon here is painted.	999
So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,	999
As if with grief or travail he had fainted,	999
To me came Tarquin armed; so beguiled	999
With outward honesty, but yet defiled	999
With inward vice: as Priam him did cherish,	999
So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish.	999
	999
'Look, look, how listening Priam wets his eyes,	999
To see those borrow'd tears that Sinon sheds!	999
Priam, why art thou old and yet not wise?	999
For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds:	999
His eye drops fire, no water thence proceeds;	999
Those round clear pearls of his, that move thy pity,	999
Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city.	999
	999
'Such devils steal effects from lightless hell;	999
For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,	999
And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell;	999
These contraries such unity do hold,	999
Only to flatter fools and make them bold:	999
So Priam's trust false Sinon's tears doth flatter,	999
That he finds means to burn his Troy with water.'	999
	999
Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,	999
That patience is quite beaten from her breast.	999
She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,	999
Comparing him to that unhappy guest	999
Whose deed hath made herself herself detest:	999
At last she smilingly with this gives o'er;	999
'Fool, fool!' quoth she, 'his wounds will not be sore.'	999
	999
Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow,	999
And time doth weary time with her complaining.	999
She looks for night, and then she longs for morrow,	999
And both she thinks too long with her remaining:	999
Short time seems long in sorrow's sharp sustaining:	999
Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps,	999
And they that watch see time how slow it creeps.	999
	999
Which all this time hath overslipp'd her thought,	999
That she with painted images hath spent;	999
Being from the feeling of her own grief brought	999
By deep surmise of others' detriment;	999
Losing her woes in shows of discontent.	999
It easeth some, though none it ever cured,	999
To think their dolour others have endured.	999
	999
But now the mindful messenger, come back,	999
Brings home his lord and other company;	999
Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black:	999
And round about her tear-stained eye	999
Blue circles stream'd; like rainbows in the sky:	999
These water-galls in her dim element	999
Foretell new storms to those already spent.	999
	999
Which when her sad-beholding husband saw,	999
Amazedly in her sad face he stares:	999
Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,	999
Her lively colour kill'd with deadly cares.	999
He hath no power to ask her how she fares:	999
Both stood, like old acquaintance in a trance,	999
Met far from home, wondering each other's chance.	999
	999
At last he takes her by the bloodless hand,	999
And thus begins: 'What uncouth ill event	999
Hath thee befall'n, that thou dost trembling stand?	999
Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?	999
Why art thou thus attired in discontent?	999
Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness,	999
And tell thy grief, that we may give redress.'	999
	999
Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire,	999
Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:	999
At length address'd to answer his desire,	999
She modestly prepares to let them know	999
Her honour is ta'en prisoner by the foe;	999
While Collatine and his consorted lords	999
With sad attention long to hear her words.	999
	999
And now this pale swan in her watery nest	999
Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending;	999
'Few words,' quoth she, 'Shall fit the trespass best,	999
Where no excuse can give the fault amending:	999
In me moe woes than words are now depending;	999
And my laments would be drawn out too long,	999
To tell them all with one poor tired tongue.	999
	999
'Then be this all the task it hath to say	999
Dear husband, in the interest of thy bed	999
A stranger came, and on that pillow lay	999
Where thou was wont to rest thy weary head;	999
And what wrong else may be imagined	999
By foul enforcement might be done to me,	999
From that, alas, thy Lucrece is not free.	999
	999
'For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight,	999
With shining falchion in my chamber came	999
A creeping creature, with a flaming light,	999
And softly cried 'Awake, thou Roman dame,	999
And entertain my love; else lasting shame	999
On thee and thine this night I will inflict,	999
If thou my love's desire do contradict.	999
	999
' 'For some hard-favour'd groom of thine,' quoth he,	999
'Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will,	999
I'll murder straight, and then I'll slaughter thee	999
And swear I found you where you did fulfil	999
The loathsome act of lust, and so did kill	999
The lechers in their deed: this act will be	999
My fame and thy perpetual infamy.'	999
	999
'With this, I did begin to start and cry;	999
And then against my heart he sets his sword,	999
Swearing, unless I took all patiently,	999
I should not live to speak another word;	999
So should my shame still rest upon record,	999
And never be forgot in mighty Rome	999
Th' adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom.	999
	999
'Mine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,	999
And far the weaker with so strong a fear:	999
My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak;	999
No rightful plea might plead for justice there:	999
His scarlet lust came evidence to swear	999
That my poor beauty had purloin'd his eyes;	999
And when the judge is robb'd the prisoner dies.	999
	999
'O, teach me how to make mine own excuse!	999
Or at the least this refuge let me find;	999
Though my gross blood be stain'd with this abuse,	999
Immaculate and spotless is my mind;	999
That was not forced; that never was inclined	999
To accessary yieldings, but still pure	999
Doth in her poison'd closet yet endure.'	999
	999
Lo, here, the hopeless merchant of this loss,	999
With head declined, and voice damm'd up with woe,	999
With sad set eyes, and wretched arms across,	999
From lips new-waxen pale begins to blow	999
The grief away that stops his answer so:	999
But, wretched as he is, he strives in vain;	999
What he breathes out his breath drinks up again.	999
	999
As through an arch the violent roaring tide	999
Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,	999
Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride	999
Back to the strait that forced him on so fast;	999
In rage sent out, recall'd in rage, being past:	999
Even so his sighs, his sorrows, make a saw,	999
To push grief on, and back the same grief draw.	999
	999
Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth,	999
And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh:	999
'Dear lord, thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth	999
Another power; no flood by raining slaketh.	999
My woe too sensible thy passion maketh	999
More feeling-painful: let it then suffice	999
To drown one woe, one pair of weeping eyes.	999
	999
'And for my sake, when I might charm thee so,	999
For she that was thy Lucrece, now attend me:	999
Be suddenly revenged on my foe,	999
Thine, mine, his own: suppose thou dost defend me	999
From what is past: the help that thou shalt lend me	999
Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die;	999
For sparing justice feeds iniquity.	999
	999
'But ere I name him, you fair lords,' quoth she,	999
Speaking to those that came with Collatine,	999
'Shall plight your honourable faiths to me,	999
With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine;	999
For 'tis a meritorious fair design	999
To chase injustice with revengeful arms:	999
Knights, by their oaths, should right poor ladies' harms.'	999
	999
At this request, with noble disposition	999
Each present lord began to promise aid,	999
As bound in knighthood to her imposition,	999
Longing to hear the hateful foe bewray'd.	999
But she, that yet her sad task hath not said,	999
The protestation stops. 'O, speak, ' quoth she,	999
'How may this forced stain be wiped from me?	999
	999
'What is the quality of mine offence,	999
Being constrain'd with dreadful circumstance?	999
May my pure mind with the foul act dispense,	999
My low-declined honour to advance?	999
May any terms acquit me from this chance?	999
The poison'd fountain clears itself again;	999
And why not I from this compelled stain?'	999
	999
With this, they all at once began to say,	999
Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;	999
While with a joyless smile she turns away	999
The face, that map which deep impression bears	999
Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.	999
'No, no,' quoth she, 'no dame, hereafter living,	999
By my excuse shall claim excuse's giving.'	999
	999
Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,	999
She throws forth Tarquin's name; 'He, he,' she says,	999
But more than 'he' her poor tongue could not speak;	999
Till after many accents and delays,	999
Untimely breathings, sick and short assays,	999
She utters this, 'He, he, fair lords, 'tis he,	999
That guides this hand to give this wound to me.'	999
	999
Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast	999
A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed:	999
That blow did that it from the deep unrest	999
Of that polluted prison where it breathed:	999
Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath'd	999
Her winged sprite, and through her wounds doth fly	999
Life's lasting date from cancell'd destiny.	999
	999
Stone-still, astonish'd with this deadly deed,	999
Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew;	999
Till Lucrece' father, that beholds her bleed,	999
Himself on her self-slaughter'd body threw;	999
And from the purple fountain Brutus drew	999
The murderous knife, and, as it left the place,	999
Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;	999
	999
And bubbling from her breast, it doth divide	999
In two slow rivers, that the crimson blood	999
Circles her body in on every side,	999
Who, like a late-sack'd island, vastly stood	999
Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood.	999
Some of her blood still pure and red remain'd,	999
And some look'd black, and that false Tarquin stain'd.	999
	999
About the mourning and congealed face	999
Of that black blood a watery rigol goes,	999
Which seems to weep upon the tainted place:	999
And ever since, as pitying Lucrece' woes,	999
Corrupted blood some watery token shows;	999
And blood untainted still doth red abide,	999
Blushing at that which is so putrified.	999
	999
'Daughter, dear daughter,' old Lucretius cries,	999
'That life was mine which thou hast here deprived.	999
If in the child the father's image lies,	999
Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived?	999
Thou wast not to this end from me derived.	999
If children predecease progenitors,	999
We are their offspring, and they none of ours.	999
	999
'Poor broken glass, I often did behold	999
In thy sweet semblance my old age new born;	999
But now that fresh fair mirror, dim and old,	999
Shows me a bare-boned death by time out-worn:	999
O, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn,	999
And shivered all the beauty of my glass,	999
That I no more can see what once I was!	999
	999
'O time, cease thou thy course and last no longer,	999
If they surcease to be that should survive.	999
Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger	999
And leave the faltering feeble souls alive?	999
The old bees die, the young possess their hive:	999
Then live, sweet Lucrece, live again and see	999
Thy father die, and not thy father thee!	999
	999
By this, starts Collatine as from a dream,	999
And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place;	999
And then in key-cold Lucrece' bleeding stream	999
He falls, and bathes the pale fear in his face,	999
And counterfeits to die with her a space;	999
Till manly shame bids him possess his breath	999
And live to be revenged on her death.	999
	999
The deep vexation of his inward soul	999
Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue;	999
Who, mad that sorrow should his use control,	999
Or keep him from heart-easing words so long,	999
Begins to talk; but through his lips do throng	999
Weak words, so thick come in his poor heart's aid,	999
That no man could distinguish what he said.	999
	999
Yet sometime 'Tarquin' was pronounced plain,	999
But through his teeth, as if the name he tore.	999
This windy tempest, till it blow up rain,	999
Held back his sorrow's tide, to make it more;	999
At last it rains, and busy winds give o'er:	999
Then son and father weep with equal strife	999
Who should weep most, for daughter or for wife.	999
	999
The one doth call her his, the other his,	999
Yet neither may possess the claim they lay.	999
The father says 'She's mine.' 'O, mine she is,'	999
Replies her husband: 'do not take away	999
My sorrow's interest; let no mourner say	999
He weeps for her, for she was only mine,	999
And only must be wail'd by Collatine.'	999
	999
'O,' quoth Lucretius,' I did give that life	999
Which she too early and too late hath spill'd.'	999
'Woe, woe,' quoth Collatine, 'she was my wife,	999
I owed her, and 'tis mine that she hath kill'd.'	999
'My daughter' and 'my wife' with clamours fill'd	999
The dispersed air, who, holding Lucrece' life,	999
Answer'd their cries, 'my daughter' and 'my wife.'	999
	999
Brutus, who pluck'd the knife from Lucrece' side,	999
Seeing such emulation in their woe,	999
Began to clothe his wit in state and pride,	999
Burying in Lucrece' wound his folly's show.	999
He with the Romans was esteemed so	999
As silly-jeering idiots are with kings,	999
For sportive words and uttering foolish things:	999
	999
But now he throws that shallow habit by,	999
Wherein deep policy did him disguise;	999
And arm'd his long-hid wits advisedly,	999
To cheque the tears in Collatinus' eyes.	999
'Thou wronged lord of Rome,' quoth be, 'arise:	999
Let my unsounded self, supposed a fool,	999
Now set thy long-experienced wit to school.	999
	999
'Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?	999
Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?	999
Is it revenge to give thyself a blow	999
For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds?	999
Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds:	999
Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so,	999
To slay herself, that should have slain her foe.	999
	999
'Courageous Roman, do not steep thy heart	999
In such relenting dew of lamentations;	999
But kneel with me and help to bear thy part,	999
To rouse our Roman gods with invocations,	999
That they will suffer these abominations,	999
Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,	999
By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased.	999
	999
'Now, by the Capitol that we adore,	999
And by this chaste blood so unjustly stain'd,	999
By heaven's fair sun that breeds the fat earth's	999
store,	999
By all our country rights in Rome maintain'd,	999
And by chaste Lucrece' soul that late complain'd	999
Her wrongs to us, and by this bloody knife,	999
We will revenge the death of this true wife.'	999
	999
This said, he struck his hand upon his breast,	999
And kiss'd the fatal knife, to end his vow;	999
And to his protestation urged the rest,	999
Who, wondering at him, did his words allow:	999
Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow;	999
And that deep vow, which Brutus made before,	999
He doth again repeat, and that they swore.	999
	999
When they had sworn to this advised doom,	999
They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence;	999
To show her bleeding body thorough Rome,	999
And so to publish Tarquin's foul offence:	999
Which being done with speedy diligence,	999
The Romans plausibly did give consent	999
To Tarquin's everlasting banishment.	999

	999
	999
	THE PASSIONATE PILGRIM	999
	999
	999
	999
I.	999
	999
WHEN my love swears that she is made of truth,	999
I do believe her, though I know she lies,	999
That she might think me some untutor'd youth,	999
Unskilful in the world's false forgeries.	999
Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,	999
Although I know my years be past the best,	999
I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue,	999
Outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest.	999
But wherefore says my love that she is young?	999
And wherefore say not I that I am old?	999
O, love's best habit is a soothing tongue,	999
And age, in love, loves not to have years told.	999
Therefore I'll lie with love, and love with me,	999
Since that our faults in love thus smother'd be.	999
	999
	999
II.	999
	999
Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,	999
That like two spirits do suggest me still;	999
My better angel is a man right fair,	999
My worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.	999
To win me soon to hell, my female evil	999
Tempteth my better angel from my side,	999
And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,	999
Wooing his purity with her fair pride.	999
And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend,	999
Suspect I may, yet not directly tell:	999
For being both to me, both to each friend,	999
I guess one angel in another's hell;	999
The truth I shall not know, but live in doubt,	999
Till my bad angel fire my good one out.	999
	999
	999
III.	999
	999
Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,	999
'Gainst whom the world could not hold argument,	999
Persuade my heart to this false perjury?	999
Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.	999
A woman I forswore; but I will prove,	999
Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:	999
My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;	999
Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.	999
My vow was breath, and breath a vapour is;	999
Then, thou fair sun, that on this earth doth shine,	999
Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:	999
If broken, then it is no fault of mine.	999
If by me broke, what fool is not so wise	999
To break an oath, to win a paradise?	999
	999
	999
IV.	999
	999
Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook	999
With young Adonis, lovely, fresh, and green,	999
Did court the lad with many a lovely look,	999
Such looks as none could look but beauty's queen.	999
She told him stories to delight his ear;	999
She showed him favors to allure his eye;	999
To win his heart, she touch'd him here and there,--	999
Touches so soft still conquer chastity.	999
But whether unripe years did want conceit,	999
Or he refused to take her figured proffer,	999
The tender nibbler would not touch the bait,	999
But smile and jest at every gentle offer:	999
Then fell she on her back, fair queen, and toward:	999
He rose and ran away; ah, fool too froward!	999
	999
	999
V.	999
	999
If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?	999
O never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd:	999
Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll constant prove;	999
Those thoughts, to me like oaks, to thee like osiers bow'd.	999
Study his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,	999
Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend.	999
If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;	999
Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend;	999
All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;	999
Which is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire:	999
Thine eye Jove's lightning seems, thy voice his dreadful	999
thunder,	999
Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.	999
Celestial as thou art, O do not love that wrong,	999
To sing heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.	999
	999
	999
VI.	999
	999
Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,	999
And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade,	999
When Cytherea, all in love forlorn,	999
A longing tarriance for Adonis made	999
Under an osier growing by a brook,	999
A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen:	999
Hot was the day; she hotter that did look	999
For his approach, that often there had been.	999
Anon he comes, and throws his mantle by,	999
And stood stark naked on the brook's green brim:	999
The sun look'd on the world with glorious eye,	999
Yet not so wistly as this queen on him.	999
He, spying her, bounced in, whereas he stood:	999
'O Jove,' quoth she, 'why was not I a flood!'	999
	999
	999
VII.	999
	999
Fair is my love, but not so fair as fickle;	999
Mild as a dove, but neither true nor trusty;	999
Brighter than glass, and yet, as glass is, brittle;	999
Softer than wax, and yet, as iron, rusty:	999
A lily pale, with damask dye to grace her,	999
None fairer, nor none falser to deface her.	999
	999
Her lips to mine how often hath she joined,	999
Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing!	999
How many tales to please me hath she coined,	999
Dreading my love, the loss thereof still fearing!	999
Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings,	999
Her faith, her oaths, her tears, and all were jestings.	999
	999
She burn'd with love, as straw with fire flameth;	999
She burn'd out love, as soon as straw outburneth;	999
She framed the love, and yet she foil'd the framing;	999
She bade love last, and yet she fell a-turning.	999
Was this a lover, or a lecher whether?	999
Bad in the best, though excellent in neither.	999
	999
	999
VIII.	999
	999
If music and sweet poetry agree,	999
As they must needs, the sister and the brother,	999
Then must the love be great 'twixt thee and me,	999
Because thou lovest the one, and I the other.	999
Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch	999
Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;	999
Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such	999
As, passing all conceit, needs no defence.	999
Thou lovest to hear the sweet melodious sound	999
That Phoebus' lute, the queen of music, makes;	999
And I in deep delight am chiefly drown'd	999
When as himself to singing he betakes.	999
One god is god of both, as poets feign;	999
One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.	999
	999
	999
IX.	999
	999
Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love,	999
[		   ]	999
Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,	999
For Adon's sake, a youngster proud and wild;	999
Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill:	999
Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds;	999
She, silly queen, with more than love's good will,	999
Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:	999
'Once,' quoth she, 'did I see a fair sweet youth	999
Here in these brakes deep-wounded with a boar,	999
Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!	999
See, in my thigh,' quoth she, 'here was the sore.'	999
She showed hers: he saw more wounds than one,	999
And blushing fled, and left her all alone.	999
	999
	999
X.	999
	999
Sweet rose, fair flower, untimely pluck'd, soon vaded,	999
Pluck'd in the bud, and vaded in the spring!	999
Bright orient pearl, alack, too timely shaded!	999
Fair creature, kill'd too soon by death's sharp sting!	999
Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree,	999
And falls, through wind, before the fall should be.	999
	999
I weep for thee, and yet no cause I have;	999
For why thou left'st me nothing in thy will:	999
And yet thou left'st me more than I did crave;	999
For why I craved nothing of thee still:	999
O yes, dear friend, I pardon crave of thee,	999
Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me.	999
	999
	999
XI.	999
	999
Venus, with young Adonis sitting by her	999
Under a myrtle shade, began to woo him:	999
She told the youngling how god Mars did try her,	999
And as he fell to her, so fell she to him.	999
'Even thus,' quoth she, 'the warlike god embraced me,'	999
And then she clipp'd Adonis in her arms;	999
'Even thus,' quoth she, 'the warlike god unlaced me,'	999
As if the boy should use like loving charms;	999
'Even thus,' quoth she, 'he seized on my lips,'	999
And with her lips on his did act the seizure:	999
And as she fetched breath, away he skips,	999
And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure.	999
Ah, that I had my lady at this bay,	999
To kiss and clip me till I run away!	999
	999
	999
XII.	999
	999
Crabbed age and youth cannot live together:	999
Youth is full of pleasance, age is full of care;	999
Youth like summer morn, age like winter weather;	999
Youth like summer brave, age like winter bare.	999
Youth is full of sport, age's breath is short;	999
Youth is nimble, age is lame;	999
Youth is hot and bold, age is weak and cold;	999
Youth is wild, and age is tame.	999
Age, I do abhor thee; youth, I do adore thee;	999
O, my love, my love is young!	999
Age, I do defy thee: O, sweet shepherd, hie thee,	999
For methinks thou stay'st too long,	999
	999
	999
XIII.	999
	999
Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good;	999
A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly;	999
A flower that dies when first it gins to bud;	999
A brittle glass that's broken presently:	999
A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,	999
Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour.	999
	999
And as goods lost are seld or never found,	999
As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,	999
As flowers dead lie wither'd on the ground,	999
As broken glass no cement can redress,	999
So beauty blemish'd once's for ever lost,	999
In spite of physic, painting, pain and cost.	999
	999

Good night, good rest. Ah, neither be my share:	999
She bade good night that kept my rest away;	999
And daff'd me to a cabin hang'd with care,	999
To descant on the doubts of my decay.	999
'Farewell,' quoth she, 'and come again tomorrow:'	999
Fare well I could not, for I supp'd with sorrow.	999
	999
Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile,	999
In scorn or friendship, nill I construe whether:	999
'T may be, she joy'd to jest at my exile,	999
'T may be, again to make me wander thither:	999
'Wander,' a word for shadows like myself,	999
As take the pain, but cannot pluck the pelf.	999

	999
Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!	999
My heart doth charge the watch; the morning rise	999
Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest.	999
Not daring trust the office of mine eyes,	999
While Philomela sits and sings, I sit and mark,	999
And wish her lays were tuned like the lark;	999
	999
For she doth welcome daylight with her ditty,	999
And drives away dark dismal-dreaming night:	999
The night so pack'd, I post unto my pretty;	999
Heart hath his hope, and eyes their wished sight;	999
Sorrow changed to solace, solace mix'd with sorrow;	999
For why, she sigh'd and bade me come tomorrow.	999
	999
Were I with her, the night would post too soon;	999
But now are minutes added to the hours;	999
To spite me now, each minute seems a moon;	999
Yet not for me, shine sun to succor flowers!	999
Pack night, peep day; good day, of night now borrow:	999
Short, night, to-night, and length thyself tomorrow.	999

	999
IT was a lording's daughter, the fairest one of three,	999
That liked of her master as well as well might be,	999
Till looking on an Englishman, the fair'st that eye could see,	999
Her fancy fell a-turning.	999
	999
Long was the combat doubtful that love with love did fight,	999
To leave the master loveless, or kill the gallant knight:	999
To put in practise either, alas, it was a spite	999
Unto the silly damsel!	999
	999
But one must be refused; more mickle was the pain	999
That nothing could be used to turn them both to gain,	999
For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain:	999
Alas, she could not help it!	999
	999
Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day,	999
Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away:	999
Then, lullaby, the learned man hath got the lady gay;	999
For now my song is ended.	999

	999
On a day, alack the day!	999
Love, whose month was ever May,	999
Spied a blossom passing fair,	999
Playing in the wanton air:	999
Through the velvet leaves the wind	999
All unseen, gan passage find;	999
That the lover, sick to death,	999
Wish'd himself the heaven's breath,	999
'Air,' quoth he, 'thy cheeks may blow;	999
Air, would I might triumph so!	999
But, alas! my hand hath sworn	999
Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn:	999
Vow, alack! for youth unmeet:	999
Youth, so apt to pluck a sweet.	999
Thou for whom Jove would swear	999
Juno but an Ethiope were;	999
And deny himself for Jove,	999
Turning mortal for thy love.'	999

	999
My flocks feed not,	999
My ewes breed not,	999
My rams speed not,	999
All is amiss:	999
Love's denying,	999
Faith's defying,	999
Heart's renying,	999
Causer of this.	999
All my merry jigs are quite forgot,	999
All my lady's love is lost, God wot:	999
Where her faith was firmly fix'd in love,	999
There a nay is placed without remove.	999
One silly cross	999
Wrought all my loss;	999
O frowning Fortune, cursed, fickle dame!	999
For now I see	999
Inconstancy	999
More in women than in men remain.	999
In black mourn I,	999
All fears scorn I,	999
Love hath forlorn me,	999
Living in thrall:	999
Heart is bleeding,	999
All help needing,	999
O cruel speeding,	999
Fraughted with gall.	999
My shepherd's pipe can sound no deal;	999
My wether's bell rings doleful knell;	999
My curtail dog, that wont to have play'd	999
Plays not at all, but seems afraid;	999
My sighs so deep	999
Procure to weep,	999
In howling wise, to see my doleful plight.	999
How sighs resound	999
Through heartless ground,	999
Like a thousand vanquish'd men in bloody fight!	999
Clear wells spring not,	999
Sweet birds sing not,	999
Green plants bring not	999
Forth their dye;	999
Herds stand weeping,	999
Flocks all sleeping,	999
Nymphs back peeping	999
Fearfully:	999
All our pleasure known to us poor swains,	999
All our merry meetings on the plains,	999
All our evening sport from us is fled,	999
All our love is lost, for Love is dead	999
Farewell, sweet lass,	999
Thy like ne'er was	999
For a sweet content, the cause of all my moan:	999
Poor Corydon	999
Must live alone;	999
Other help for him I see that there is none.	999

	999
When as thine eye hath chose the dame,	999
And stall'd the deer that thou shouldst strike,	999
Let reason rule things worthy blame,	999
As well as fancy partial might:	999
Take counsel of some wiser head,	999
Neither too young nor yet unwed.	999
	999
And when thou comest thy tale to tell,	999
Smooth not thy tongue with filed talk,	999
Lest she some subtle practise smell,--	999
A cripple soon can find a halt;--	999
But plainly say thou lovest her well,	999
	999
And set thy person forth to sell.	999
What though her frowning brows be bent,	999
Her cloudy looks will calm ere night:	999
And then too late she will repent	999
That thus dissembled her delight;	999
And twice desire, ere it be day,	999
That which with scorn she put away.	999
	999
What though she strive to try her strength,	999
And ban and brawl, and say thee nay,	999
Her feeble force will yield at length,	999
When craft hath taught her thus to say,	999
'Had women been so strong as men,	999
In faith, you had not had it then.'	999
	999
And to her will frame all thy ways;	999
Spare not to spend, and chiefly there	999
Where thy desert may merit praise,	999
By ringing in thy lady's ear:	999
The strongest castle, tower, and town,	999
The golden bullet beats it down.	999
	999
Serve always with assured trust,	999
And in thy suit be humble true;	999
Unless thy lady prove unjust,	999
Press never thou to choose anew:	999
When time shall serve, be thou not slack	999
To proffer, though she put thee back.	999
	999
The wiles and guiles that women work,	999
Dissembled with an outward show,	999
The tricks and toys that in them lurk,	999
The cock that treads them shall not know.	999
Have you not heard it said full oft,	999
A woman's nay doth stand for nought?	999
	999
Think women still to strive with men,	999
To sin and never for to saint:	999
There is no heaven, by holy then,	999
When time with age doth them attaint.	999
Were kisses all the joys in bed,	999
One woman would another wed.	999
	999
But, soft! enough, too much, I fear	999
Lest that my mistress hear my song,	999
She will not stick to round me i' the ear,	999
To teach my tongue to be so long:	999
Yet will she blush, here be it said,	999
To hear her secrets so bewray'd.	999
	999

XX.	999
	999
Live with me, and be my love,	999
And we will all the pleasures prove	999
That hills and valleys, dales and fields,	999
And all the craggy mountains yields.	999
	999
There will we sit upon the rocks,	999
And see the shepherds feed their flocks,	999
By shallow rivers, by whose falls	999
Melodious birds sing madrigals.	999
	999
There will I make thee a bed of roses,	999
With a thousand fragrant posies,	999
A cap of flowers, and a kirtle	999
Embroider'd all with leaves of myrtle.	999
	999
A belt of straw and ivy buds,	999
With coral clasps and amber studs;	999
And if these pleasures may thee move,	999
Then live with me and be my love.	999
	999
	999
LOVE'S ANSWER.	999
	999
If that the world and love were young,	999

To live with thee and be thy love.	999

XXI.	999
	999
As it fell upon a day	999
In the merry month of May,	999
Sitting in a pleasant shade	999
Which a grove of myrtles made,	999
Beasts did leap, and birds did sing,	999
Trees did grow, and plants did spring;	999
Every thing did banish moan,	999
Save the nightingale alone:	999
She, poor bird, as all forlorn,	999
Lean'd her breast up-till a thorn	999
And there sung the dolefull'st ditty,	999
That to hear it was great pity:	999
'Fie, fie, fie,' now would she cry;	999
'Tereu, tereu!' by and by;	999
That to hear her so complain,	999
Scarce I could from tears refrain;	999
For her griefs, so lively shown,	999
Made me think upon mine own.	999
Ah, thought I, thou mourn'st in vain!	999
None takes pity on thy pain:	999
Senseless trees they cannot hear thee;	999
Ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee:	999
King Pandion he is dead;	999
All thy friends are lapp'd in lead;	999
All thy fellow birds do sing,	999
Careless of thy sorrowing.	999
Even so, poor bird, like thee,	999
None alive will pity me.	999
Whilst as fickle Fortune smiled,	999
Thou and I were both beguiled.	999
Every one that flatters thee	999
Is no friend in misery.	999
Words are easy, like the wind;	999
Faithful friends are hard to find:	999
Every man will be thy friend	999
Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend;	999
But if store of crowns be scant,	999
No man will supply thy want.	999
If that one be prodigal,	999
Bountiful they will him call,	999
And with such-like flattering,	999
'Pity but he were a king;'	999
If he be addict to vice,	999
Quickly him they will entice;	999
If to women he be bent,	999
They have at commandement:	999
But if Fortune once do frown,	999
Then farewell his great renown	999
They that fawn'd on him before	999
Use his company no more.	999
He that is thy friend indeed,	999
He will help thee in thy need:	999
If thou sorrow, he will weep;	999
If thou wake, he cannot sleep;	999
Thus of every grief in heart	999
He with thee doth bear a part.	999
These are certain signs to know	999
Faithful friend from flattering foe.	999

	THE PHOENIX AND THE TURTLE	999
	999
	999
	999
	LET the bird of loudest lay,	999
	On the sole Arabian tree,	999
	Herald sad and trumpet be,	999
	To whose sound chaste wings obey.	999
	999
	But thou shrieking harbinger,	999
	Foul precurrer of the fiend,	999
	Augur of the fever's end,	999
	To this troop come thou not near!	999
	999
	From this session interdict	999
	Every fowl of tyrant wing,	999
	Save the eagle, feather'd king:	999
	Keep the obsequy so strict.	999
	999
	Let the priest in surplice white,	999
	That defunctive music can,	999
	Be the death-divining swan,	999

	999
	And thou treble-dated crow,	999
	That thy sable gender makest	999
	With the breath thou givest and takest,	999
	'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.	999
	999
	Here the anthem doth commence:	999
	Love and constancy is dead;	999
	Phoenix and the turtle fled	999
	In a mutual flame from hence.	999
	999
	So they loved, as love in twain	999
	Had the essence but in one;	999
	Two distincts, division none:	999
	Number there in love was slain.	999
	999
	Hearts remote, yet not asunder;	999
	Distance, and no space was seen	999
	'Twixt the turtle and his queen:	999
	But in them it were a wonder.	999
	999
	So between them love did shine,	999
	That the turtle saw his right	999
	Flaming in the phoenix' sight;	999
	Either was the other's mine.	999
	999
	Property was thus appalled,	999
	That the self was not the same;	999
	Single nature's double name	999
	Neither two nor one was called.	999
	999
	Reason, in itself confounded,	999
	Saw division grow together,	999
	To themselves yet either neither,	999
	Simple were so well compounded,	999
	999
	That it cried, How true a twain	999
	Seemeth this concordant one!	999
	Love hath reason, reason none,	999
	If what parts can so remain.	999
	999
	Whereupon it made this threne	999
	To the phoenix and the dove,	999
	Co-supremes and stars of love,	999
	As chorus to their tragic scene.	999
	999
	THRENOS.	999
	999
	Beauty, truth, and rarity,	999
	Grace in all simplicity,	999
	Here enclosed in cinders lie.	999
	999
	Death is now the phoenix' nest	999
	And the turtle's loyal breast	999
	To eternity doth rest,	999
	999
	Leaving no posterity:	999
	'Twas not their infirmity,	999
	It was married chastity.	999
	999
	Truth may seem, but cannot be:	999
	Beauty brag, but 'tis not she;	999
	Truth and beauty buried be.	999
	999
	To this urn let those repair	999
	That are either true or fair	999
	For these dead birds sigh a prayer.	999

  	A LOVER'S COMPLAINT	999
	999
FROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded	999
A plaintful story from a sistering vale,	999
My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,	999
And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;	999
Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,	999
Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,	999
Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.	999
	999
Upon her head a platted hive of straw,	999
Which fortified her visage from the sun,	999
Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw	999
The carcass of beauty spent and done:	999
Time had not scythed all that youth begun,	999
Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,	999
Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.	999
	999
Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,	999
Which on it had conceited characters,	999
Laundering the silken figures in the brine	999
That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,	999
And often reading what contents it bears;	999
As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,	999
In clamours of all size, both high and low.	999
	999
Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,	999
As they did battery to the spheres intend;	999
Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied	999
To the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend	999
Their view right on; anon their gazes lend	999
To every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,	999
The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.	999
	999
Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,	999
Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride	999
For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,	999
Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;	999
Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,	999
And true to bondage would not break from thence,	999
Though slackly braided in loose negligence.	999
	999
A thousand favours from a maund she drew	999
Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,	999
Which one by one she in a river threw,	999
Upon whose weeping margent she was set;	999
Like usury, applying wet to wet,	999
Or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall	999
Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.	999
	999
Of folded schedules had she many a one,	999
Which she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;	999
Crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone	999
Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;	999
Found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,	999
With sleided silk feat and affectedly	999
Enswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy.	999
	999
These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,	999
And often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear:	999
Cried 'O false blood, thou register of lies,	999
What unapproved witness dost thou bear!	999
Ink would have seem'd more black and damned here!'	999
This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,	999
Big discontent so breaking their contents.	999
	999
A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh--	999
Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew	999
Of court, of city, and had let go by	999
The swiftest hours, observed as they flew--	999
Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,	999
And, privileged by age, desires to know	999
In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.	999
	999
So slides he down upon his grained bat,	999
And comely-distant sits he by her side;	999
When he again desires her, being sat,	999
Her grievance with his hearing to divide:	999
If that from him there may be aught applied	999
Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,	999
'Tis promised in the charity of age.	999
	999
'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold	999
The injury of many a blasting hour,	999
Let it not tell your judgment I am old;	999
Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power:	999
I might as yet have been a spreading flower,	999
Fresh to myself, If I had self-applied	999
Love to myself and to no love beside.	999
	999
'But, woe is me! too early I attended	999
A youthful suit--it was to gain my grace--	999
Of one by nature's outwards so commended,	999
That maidens' eyes stuck over all his face:	999
Love lack'd a dwelling, and made him her place;	999
And when in his fair parts she did abide,	999
She was new lodged and newly deified.	999
	999
'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;	999
And every light occasion of the wind	999
Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.	999
What's sweet to do, to do will aptly find:	999
Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,	999
For on his visage was in little drawn	999
What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.	999
	999
'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;	999
His phoenix down began but to appear	999
Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin	999
Whose bare out-bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear:	999
Yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear;	999
And nice affections wavering stood in doubt	999
If best were as it was, or best without.	999
	999
'His qualities were beauteous as his form,	999
For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;	999
Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm	999
As oft 'twixt May and April is to see,	999
When winds breathe sweet, untidy though they be.	999
His rudeness so with his authorized youth	999
Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.	999
	999
'Well could he ride, and often men would say	999
'That horse his mettle from his rider takes:	999
Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,	999
What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop	999
he makes!'	999
And controversy hence a question takes,	999
Whether the horse by him became his deed,	999
Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.	999
	999
'But quickly on this side the verdict went:	999
His real habitude gave life and grace	999
To appertainings and to ornament,	999
Accomplish'd in himself, not in his case:	999
All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,	999
Came for additions; yet their purposed trim	999
Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.	999
	999
'So on the tip of his subduing tongue	999
All kinds of arguments and question deep,	999
All replication prompt, and reason strong,	999
For his advantage still did wake and sleep:	999
To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,	999
He had the dialect and different skill,	999
Catching all passions in his craft of will:	999
	999
'That he did in the general bosom reign	999
Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,	999
To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain	999
In personal duty, following where he haunted:	999
Consents bewitch'd, ere he desire, have granted;	999
And dialogued for him what he would say,	999
Ask'd their own wills, and made their wills obey.	999
	999
'Many there were that did his picture get,	999
To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;	999
Like fools that in th' imagination set	999
The goodly objects which abroad they find	999
Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign'd;	999
And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them	999
Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:	999
	999
'So many have, that never touch'd his hand,	999
Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.	999
My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,	999
And was my own fee-simple, not in part,	999
What with his art in youth, and youth in art,	999
Threw my affections in his charmed power,	999
Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.	999
	999
'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,	999
Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;	999
Finding myself in honour so forbid,	999
With safest distance I mine honour shielded:	999
Experience for me many bulwarks builded	999
Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil	999
Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.	999
	999
'But, ah, who ever shunn'd by precedent	999
The destined ill she must herself assay?	999
Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,	999
To put the by-past perils in her way?	999
Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay;	999
For when we rage, advice is often seen	999
By blunting us to make our wits more keen.	999
	999
'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,	999
That we must curb it upon others' proof;	999
To be forbod the sweets that seem so good,	999
For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.	999
O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!	999
The one a palate hath that needs will taste,	999
Though Reason weep, and cry, 'It is thy last.'	999
	999
'For further I could say 'This man's untrue,'	999
And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;	999
Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,	999
Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;	999
Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;	999
Thought characters and words merely but art,	999
And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.	999
	999
'And long upon these terms I held my city,	999
Till thus he gan besiege me: 'Gentle maid,	999
Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,	999
And be not of my holy vows afraid:	999
That's to ye sworn to none was ever said;	999
For feasts of love I have been call'd unto,	999
Till now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.	999
	999
''All my offences that abroad you see	999
Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;	999
Love made them not: with acture they may be,	999
Where neither party is nor true nor kind:	999
They sought their shame that so their shame did find;	999
And so much less of shame in me remains,	999
By how much of me their reproach contains.	999
	999
''Among the many that mine eyes have seen,	999
Not one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd,	999
Or my affection put to the smallest teen,	999
Or any of my leisures ever charm'd:	999
Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harm'd;	999
Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,	999
And reign'd, commanding in his monarchy.	999
	999
''Look here, what tributes wounded fancies sent me,	999
Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;	999
Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me	999
Of grief and blushes, aptly understood	999
In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;	999
Effects of terror and dear modesty,	999
Encamp'd in hearts, but fighting outwardly.	999
	999
''And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,	999
With twisted metal amorously impleach'd,	999
I have received from many a several fair,	999
Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd,	999
With the annexions of fair gems enrich'd,	999
And deep-brain'd sonnets that did amplify	999
Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.	999
	999
''The diamond,--why, 'twas beautiful and hard,	999
Whereto his invised properties did tend;	999
The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard	999
Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;	999
The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend	999
With objects manifold: each several stone,	999
With wit well blazon'd, smiled or made some moan.	999
	999
''Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,	999
Of pensived and subdued desires the tender,	999
Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,	999
But yield them up where I myself must render,	999
That is, to you, my origin and ender;	999
For these, of force, must your oblations be,	999
Since I their altar, you enpatron me.	999
	999
''O, then, advance of yours that phraseless hand,	999
Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;	999
Take all these similes to your own command,	999
Hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;	999
What me your minister, for you obeys,	999
Works under you; and to your audit comes	999
Their distract parcels in combined sums.	999
	999
''Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,	999
Or sister sanctified, of holiest note;	999
Which late her noble suit in court did shun,	999
Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;	999
For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,	999
But kept cold distance, and did thence remove,	999
To spend her living in eternal love.	999
	999
''But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave	999
The thing we have not, mastering what not strives,	999
Playing the place which did no form receive,	999
Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?	999
She that her fame so to herself contrives,	999
The scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight,	999
And makes her absence valiant, not her might.	999
	999
''O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:	999
The accident which brought me to her eye	999
Upon the moment did her force subdue,	999
And now she would the caged cloister fly:	999
Religious love put out Religion's eye:	999
Not to be tempted, would she be immured,	999
And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.	999
	999
''How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!	999
The broken bosoms that to me belong	999
Have emptied all their fountains in my well,	999
And mine I pour your ocean all among:	999
I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,	999
Must for your victory us all congest,	999
As compound love to physic your cold breast.	999
	999
''My parts had power to charm a sacred nun,	999
Who, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace,	999
Believed her eyes when they to assail begun,	999
All vows and consecrations giving place:	999
O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space,	999
In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,	999
For thou art all, and all things else are thine.	999
	999
''When thou impressest, what are precepts worth	999
Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,	999
How coldly those impediments stand forth	999
Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!	999
Love's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense,	999
'gainst shame,	999
And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,	999
The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.	999
	999
''Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,	999
Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine;	999
And supplicant their sighs to you extend,	999
To leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine,	999
Lending soft audience to my sweet design,	999
And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath	999
That shall prefer and undertake my troth.'	999
	999
'This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,	999
Whose sights till then were levell'd on my face;	999
Each cheek a river running from a fount	999
With brinish current downward flow'd apace:	999
O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!	999
Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses	999
That flame through water which their hue encloses.	999
	999
'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies	999
In the small orb of one particular tear!	999
But with the inundation of the eyes	999
What rocky heart to water will not wear?	999
What breast so cold that is not warmed here?	999
O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,	999
Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.	999
	999
'For, lo, his passion, but an art of craft,	999
Even there resolved my reason into tears;	999
There my white stole of chastity I daff'd,	999
Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;	999
Appear to him, as he to me appears,	999
All melting; though our drops this difference bore,	999
His poison'd me, and mine did him restore.	999
	999
'In him a plenitude of subtle matter,	999
Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,	999
Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,	999
Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,	999
In either's aptness, as it best deceives,	999
To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes,	999
Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.	999
	999
'That not a heart which in his level came	999
Could 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,	999
Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;	999
And, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:	999
Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;	999
When he most burn'd in heart-wish'd luxury,	999
He preach'd pure maid, and praised cold chastity.	999
	999
'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace	999
The naked and concealed fiend he cover'd;	999
That th' unexperient gave the tempter place,	999
Which like a cherubin above them hover'd.	999
Who, young and simple, would not be so lover'd?	999
Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make	999
What I should do again for such a sake.	999
	999
'O, that infected moisture of his eye,	999
O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow'd,	999
O, that forced thunder from his heart did fly,	999
O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow'd,	999
O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,	999
Would yet again betray the fore-betray'd,	999
And new pervert a reconciled maid!'	999
	999
